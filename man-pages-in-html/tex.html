<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

tex, virtex, initex - text formatting and typesetting
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>tex</B>

[<I>options</I>]

[<I>commands</I>]


<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete
documentation for this version of TeX can be found in the info file
or manual
<I>Web2C: A TeX implementation</I>.

<P>

TeX
formats the interspersed text and commands contained in the named
files
and outputs a typesetter independent file (called
<I>DVI</I>,

which is short for
<I>DeVice Independent</I>).

TeX's capabilities and language are described in
<I>The TeX
book</I>.

TeX
is normally used with a large body of precompiled macros,
and there are several specific formatting systems, such as
LaTeX,
which require the support of several macro files.
<P>

This version of TeX looks at its command line to see what name it
was called under.  Both
<B>initex</B>

and
<B>virtex</B>

are symlinks to the
<B>tex</B>

executable.  When called as
<B>initex</B>

(or when the
<B>--ini</B>

option is given) it can be used to precompile macros into a
<I>.fmt</I>

file.  When called as
<B>virtex</B>

it will use the
<I>plain</I>

format.  When called under any other name, TeX will use that name as
the name of the format to use.  For example, when called as
<B>tex</B>

the
<I>tex</I>

format is used, which is identical to the
<I>plain</I>

format.  The commands defined by the
<I>plain</I>

format are documented in
<I>The TeX
book</I>.

Other formats that are often available include
<I>latex</I>

and
<I>amstex</I>.

<P>

The
<I>commands</I>

given on the command line to the
TeX
program are passed to it as the first input line.  (But it is often
easier to type extended arguments as the first input line, since UNIX
shells tend to gobble up or misinterpret TeX's favorite symbols,
like backslashes, unless you quote them.)
As described in
<I>The TeX
book</I>,

that first line should begin with a filename, a
<I>\controlsequence</I>,

or a
<I>&amp;formatname</I>.

<P>

The normal usage is to say
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>tex paper</I>

</DL>

to start processing
<I>paper.tex</I>.

The name
<I>paper</I>

will be the ``jobname'', and is used in forming
output filenames.
If TeX doesn't get a filename in the first line, the jobname is
<I>texput</I>.

When looking for a file, TeX looks for the name with and without the
default extension
(<I>.tex</I>)

appended, unless the name already contains that extension.  If
<I>paper</I>

is the ``jobname'',
a log of error messages, with rather more detail than normally appears
on the screen, will appear in
<I>paper.log</I>,

and the output file will be in
<I>paper.dvi</I>.

<P>

This version of TeX can look in the first line of the file
<I>paper.tex</I>

to see if it begins with the magic sequence
<I>%&amp;</I>.

If the first line begins with
<B>%&amp;</B><I>format</I>

<B>--translate-file</B><I>&nbsp;tcxname</I>

then TeX will use the named format and transation table
<I>tcxname</I>

to process the source file.  Either the format name or the
<B>--translate-file</B>

specification may be omitted, but not both.  This overrides the
format selection based on the name by which the program is invoked.
The
<B>--parse-first-line</B>

option or the
<B>parse_first_line</B>

configuration variable control whether this behaviour is enabled.
<P>

The
<I>e</I>

response to TeX's error prompt causes the system default editor to
start up at the current line of the current file.  The environment
variable TEXEDIT can be used to change the editor used.  It may
contain a string with &quot;%s&quot; indicating where the filename goes and &quot;%d&quot;
indicating where the decimal line number (if any) goes.  For example,
a TEXEDIT string for
<B>emacs</B>

can be set with the
<B>sh</B>

command
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<I>TEXEDIT=&quot;emacs +%d %s&quot;; export TEXEDIT</I>
</DL>

<P>

A convenient file in the library is
<I>null.tex</I>,

containing nothing.
When TeX can't find a file it thinks you want to input, it keeps
asking you for another filename; responding `null' gets you out
of the loop if you don't want to input anything.  You can also type your
EOF character (usually control-D).
<P>


<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

This version of TeX understands the following command line options.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--file-line-error-style</B>

<DD>

Print error messages in the form
<I>file:line:error</I>

which is similar to the way many compilers format them.
<DT><B>--fmt</B><I>&nbsp;format</I>

<DD>

Use
<I>format</I>

as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which
TeX was called or a
<I>%&amp;</I>

line.
<DT><B>--help</B>

<DD>

Print help message and exit.
<DT><B>--ini</B>

<DD>

Be
<B>initex</B>,

for dumping formats; this is implicitly true if the program is called
as
<B>initex</B>.

<DT><B>--interaction</B><I>&nbsp;mode</I>

<DD>

Sets the interaction mode.  The mode can be one of
<I>batchmode</I>,

<I>nonstopmode</I>,

<I>scrollmode</I>,

and
<I>errorstopmode</I>.

The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding
\commands.
<DT><B>--ipc</B>

<DD>

Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether
this option is available is the choice of the installer.
<DT><B>--ipc-start</B>

<DD>

As
<B>--ipc</B>,

and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option
is available is the choice of the installer.
<DT><B>--jobname</B><I>&nbsp;name</I>

<DD>

Use
<I>name</I>

for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.
<DT><B>--kpathsea-debug</B><I>&nbsp;bitmask</I>

<DD>

Sets path searching debugging flags according to the bitmask.  See the
<I>Kpathsea</I>

manual for details.
<DT><B>--maketex</B><I>&nbsp;fmt</I>

<DD>

Enable
mktex<I>fmt</I>,

where
<I>fmt</I>

must be one of
<I>tex</I>

or
<I>tfm</I>.

<DT><B>--mltex</B>

<DD>

Enable MLTeX extensions.
<DT><B>--no-maketex</B><I>&nbsp;fmt</I>

<DD>

Disable
mktex<I>fmt</I>,

where
<I>fmt</I>

must be one of
<I>tex</I>

or
<I>tfm</I>.

<DT><B>--output-comment</B><I>&nbsp;string</I>

<DD>

Use
<I>string</I>

for the DVI file comment instead of the date.
<DT><B>--parse-first-line</B>

<DD>

If the first line of the main input file begins with
<I>%&amp;</I>

parse it to look for a dump name or a
<B>--translate-file</B>

option.
<DT><B>--progname</B><I>&nbsp;name</I>

<DD>

Pretend to be program
<I>name</I>.

This affects both the format used and the search paths.
<DT><B>--recorder</B>

<DD>

Enable the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened
for input and output in a file with extension
<I>.fls</I>.

<DT><B>--shell-escape</B>

<DD>

Enable the
<B>\write18{</B><I>command</I><B>}</B>

construct.  The
<I>command</I>

can be any Bourne shell command.  This construct is normally
disallowed for security reasons.
<DT><B>--translate-file</B><I>&nbsp;tcxname</I>

<DD>

Use the
<I>tcxname</I>

translation table.
<DT><B>--version</B>

<DD>

Print version information and exit.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications'
node) for precise details of how the environment variables are used.
The
<B>kpsewhich</B>

utility can be used to query the values of the variables.
<P>

One caveat: In most TeX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you
give directly to TeX, because ~ is an active character, and hence is
expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such as
Metafont, do not have this problem.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>TEXMFOUTPUT<DD>
Normally, TeX puts its output files in the current directory.  If
any output file cannot be opened there, it tries to open it in the
directory specified in the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT.
There is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say
<I>tex paper</I>

and the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has
the value
<I>/tmp</I>,

TeX attempts to create
<I>/tmp/paper.log</I>

(and
<I>/tmp/paper.dvi</I>,

if any output is produced.)
<DT>TEXINPUTS<DD>
Search path for
<I>\input</I>

and
<I>\openin</I>

files.
This should probably start with ``.'', so
that user files are found before system files.  An empty path
component will be replaced with the paths defined in the
<I>texmf.cnf</I>

file.  For example, set TEXINPUTS to &quot;.:/home/usr/tex:&quot; to prepend the
current direcory and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path.
<DT>TEXEDIT<DD>
Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually
<B>vi</B>,

is set when TeX is compiled.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to
system.  Use the
<B>kpsewhich</B>

utility to find their locations.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>texmf.cnf</I>

<DD>
Configuration file.  This contains definitions of search paths as well
as other configuration parameters like
<B>parse_first_line</B>.

<DT><I>tex.pool</I>

<DD>
Encoded text of TeX's messages.
<DT><I>texfonts.map</I>

<DD>
Filename mapping definitions.
<DT><I>*.tfm</I>

<DD>
Metric files for TeX's fonts.
<DT><I>*.fmt</I>

<DD>
Predigested TeX format (.fmt) files.
<DT><I>$TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/plain.tex</I>

<DD>
The basic macro package described in the TeX
book.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

This version of TeX implements a number of optional extensions.
In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a greater or lesser
extent with the definition of TeX.  When such extensions are
enabled, the banner printed when TeX starts is changed to print
<B>TeXk</B>

instead of
<B>TeX</B>.

<P>

This version of TeX fails to trap arithmetic overflow when
dimensions are added or subtracted.  Cases where this occurs are rare,
but when it does the generated
<I>DVI</I>

file will be invalid.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TRIVIA</H2>

TeX, pronounced properly, rhymes with ``blecchhh.''  The proper
spelling in typewriter-like fonts is ``TeX'' and not ``TEX'' or ``tex.''

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AUTHORS</H2>

TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth,
who implemented it using his Web system for Pascal programs.
It was ported to Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and
at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.
The version now offered with the Unix TeX distribution is that
generated by the Web to C system
(<B>web2c</B>),

originally written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.
