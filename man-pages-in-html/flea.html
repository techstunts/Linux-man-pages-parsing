<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

<P>

flea - Report a bug (or rather a flea) in mutt.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>

<B>flea</B>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>flea</B>

is a shell script which helps you to submit a bug report against the 
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.php">mutt</A></B>(1)

mail user agent.
<P>

If you invoke 
<B>flea</B>,

you'll first be prompted for a short
description of the problem you experience.  This will be used as the
bug report's subject line, so it should be concise, but informative.
<P>

You are then asked to assign an initial severity level to the
problem you observe; 
<B>flea</B>

will give you a description which severity level is appropriate or
not.
<P>

Then, you are asked for the location of a core dump (normally named
<B>core</B>)

which may have been left over by a crash of your 
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.php">mutt</A></B>(1).

You can just type lqnorq here, or you can enter the path leading 
to a core dump.
<B>flea</B>

will try to use either
<B><A HREF="../man1/sdb.1.php">sdb</A></B>(1),

<B><A HREF="../man1/dbx.1.php">dbx</A></B>(1),

or
<B><A HREF="../man1/gdb.1.php">gdb</A></B>(1)

to extract some information from this core dump which may be helpful
to developers in order to determine the reason for the crash.
<P>

Finally, you are asked whether or not you want to include personal
and system 
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.php">mutt</A></B>(1)

configuration files with the bug report.  If at all possible, we
urge you to answer these questions with lqyesrq, since a
reference configuration makes it incredibly easier to track down a
problem.
<P>

If you are using Debian GNU/Linux,
<B>flea</B>

will now check whether or not 
<B>mutt</B>

has been installed as a Debian
package on your system, and suggest to file the bug against the
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.php">mutt</A></B>(1)

and Debian bug tracking systems.  This option was added since the 
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.php">mutt</A></B>(1)

project uses another instantiation of the Debian bug tracking
system, so submitting bugs against both systems in one pass is
simple.
<P>

You are then dropped into your favorite editor as determined by the 
<B>EDITOR</B>

and
<B>VISUAL</B>

environment variables.  
<P>

Please give us details about the problem in the empty space below
the line reading lqPlease type your report below this linerq.
We are most interested in precise information on what symptoms you
observe and what steps may be used to reproduce the bug.  Chances
are that problems which can easily be reproduced will be fixed
quickly.  So please take some time when filling out this part of the
template.
<P>

The remainder of the template contains various kinds of information
gathered from your system, including output of the
<B><A HREF="../man1/uname.1.php">uname</A></B>(1)

command, output from
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.php">mutt</A></B>(1)

itself, and your system's 
<B><A HREF="../man1/mutt.1.php">mutt</A></B>(1)

configuration files.  You may wish to browse through this part of
the bug report form in order to avoid leaking confidential
information to the public.
<P>

If you leave the editor, 
<B>flea</B>

will give you the option to review, re-edit, submit, or abandon your
bug report.  If you decide to submit it, a mail message containing
your report will be sent to &lt;<A HREF="mailto:submit@bugs.guug.de">submit@bugs.guug.de</A>&gt;.  You'll receive a
copy of this message.
<P>

While your bug report is being processed by the bug tracking system,
you will receive various e-mail messages from the bug tracking
system informing you about what's going on: Once your bug report has
been entered into the bug tracking system, it will be assigned a
unique serial number about which you are informed via e-mail.  If
you wish to submit additional information about the bug, you can
just send it to the address
<B></B><I>serial</I>@bugs.guug.de.

<P>

Later, you will most likely receive questions from the developers
about the problem you observed, and you will eventually be informed
that your bug report has been closed.  This means that the bug has
been fixed at least in the
<B><A HREF="../man1/cvs.1.php">cvs</A></B>(1)

repository.  If the answers you receive don't satisfy you, don't
hesitate to contact the developers directly under
<B><A HREF="mailto:mutt-dev@mutt.org">mutt-dev@mutt.org</A>.</B>

<P>

You can also browse your bug report and all additional information
and replies connected to it using the bug tracking system's Web
interface under the following URL:
<A HREF="http://bugs.guug.de/">http://bugs.guug.de/</A>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

From header, and to send you a copy of the report.
<DT>LOGNAME<DD>

<B>EMAIL</B>

environment variable isn't set, this will be used instead to send
you a copy of the report.  Setting the sender will be left to 
<B><A HREF="../man1/sendmail.1.php">sendmail</A></B>(1)

on your system.
<DT>REPLYTO<DD>

e-mail address contained in this environment variable.
<DT>ORGANIZATION<DD>
If set, the bug report will contain an Organization header with the
contents of this environment variable.
<DT>PAGER<DD>
If set, this environment variable will be expected to contain the
path to your favorite pager for viewing the bug report.  If unset, 
<B><A HREF="../man1/more.1.php">more</A></B>(1)

will be used.
<DT>VISUAL<DD>
If set, this environment variable will be expected to contain the
path to your favorite visual editor.
<DT>EDITOR<DD>
If set, this environment variable will be expected to contain the
path to your favorite editor.  This variable is examined if and only
if the 
<B>VISUAL</B>

environment variable is unset.  If
<B>EDITOR</B>

is unset, 
<B><A HREF="../man1/vi.1.php">vi</A></B>(1)

will be used to edit the bug report.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>core<DD>
