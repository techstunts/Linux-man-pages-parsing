README.qnx - Perl version 5 on QNX
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
As of perl5.7.2 all tests pass under:
<P>



<PRE>
  QNX 4.24G
  Watcom 10.6 with Beta/970211.wcc.update.tar.F
  socket3r.lib Nov21 1996.

</PRE>


<P>

As of perl5.8.1 there is at least one test still failing.
<P>

Some tests may complain under known circumstances.
<P>

See below and hints/qnx.sh for more information.
<P>

Under <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT> 6.2.0 there are still a few tests which fail.
See below and hints/qnx.sh for more information.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Required Software for Compiling Perl on <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX4</FONT></H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
As with many unix ports, this one depends on a few ``standard''
unix utilities which are not necessarily standard for <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX4</FONT>.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>/bin/sh<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
This is used heavily by Configure and then by
perl itself. <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX4</FONT>'s version is fine, but Configure
will choke on the 16-bit version, so if you are
running <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT> 4.22, link /bin/sh to /bin32/ksh
<DT>ar<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
This is the standard unix library builder.
We use wlib. With Watcom 10.6, when wlib is
linked as ``ar'', it behaves like ar and all is
fine. Under 9.5, a cover is required. One is
included in ../qnx
<DT>nm<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
This is used (optionally) by configure to list
the contents of libraries. I will generate
a cover function on the fly in the <FONT SIZE="-1">UU</FONT> directory.
<DT>cpp<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Configure and perl need a way to invoke a C
preprocessor. I have created a simple cover
for cc which does the right thing. Without this,
Configure will create its own wrapper which works,
but it doesn't handle some of the command line arguments
that perl will throw at it.
<DT>make<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
You really need <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> make to compile this. <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> make
ships by default with <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT> 4.23, but you can get it
from quics for earlier versions.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Outstanding Issues with Perl on <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX4</FONT></H2>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
There is no support for dynamically linked libraries in <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX4</FONT>.
<P>

If you wish to compile with the Socket extension, you need
to have the <FONT SIZE="-1">TCP/IP</FONT> toolkit, and you need to make sure that
-lsocket locates the correct copy of socket3r.lib. Beware
that the Watcom compiler ships with a stub version of
socket3r.lib which has very little functionality. Also
beware the order in which wlink searches directories for
libraries. You may have /usr/lib/socket3r.lib pointing to
the correct library, but wlink may pick up
/usr/watcom/10.6/usr/lib/socket3r.lib instead. Make sure
they both point to the correct library, that is,
/usr/tcptk/current/usr/lib/socket3r.lib.
<P>

The following tests may report errors under <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX4:</FONT>
<P>

ext/Cwd/Cwd.t will complain if `pwd` and cwd don't give
the same results. cwd calls `fullpath -t`, so if you
cd `fullpath -t` before running the test, it will
pass.
<P>

lib/File/Find/taint.t will complain if '.' is in your
<FONT SIZE="-1">PATH</FONT>. The <FONT SIZE="-1">PATH</FONT> test is triggered because cwd calls
`fullpath -t`.
<P>

ext/IO/lib/IO/t/io_sock.t: Subtests 14 and 22 are skipped due to
the fact that the functionality to read back the non-blocking
status of a socket is not implemented in <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT>'s <FONT SIZE="-1">TCP/IP</FONT>. This has
been reported to <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT> and it may work with later versions of
<FONT SIZE="-1">TCP/IP</FONT>.
<P>

t/io/tell.t: Subtest 27 is failing. We are still investigating.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2><FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT> auxiliary files</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
The files in the ``qnx'' directory are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>qnx/ar<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
A script that emulates the standard unix archive (aka library)
utility.  Under Watcom 10.6, ar is linked to wlib and provides the
expected interface. With Watcom 9.5, a cover function is
required. This one is fairly crude but has proved adequate for
compiling perl.
<DT>qnx/cpp<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
A script that provides C preprocessing functionality.  Configure can
generate a similar cover, but it doesn't handle all the command-line
options that perl throws at it. This might be reasonably placed in
/usr/local/bin.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Outstanding issues with perl under <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX6</FONT></H2>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
The following tests are still failing for Perl 5.8.1 under <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT> 6.2.0:
<P>



<PRE>
  op/sprintf.........................FAILED at test 91
  lib/Benchmark......................FAILED at test 26

</PRE>


<P>

This is due to a bug in the C library's printf routine.
printf(``'%e''', 0. ) produces '0.000000e+0', but <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT> requires
'0.000000e+00'. <FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT> has acknowledged the bug.
