<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>chattr</B>

changes the file attributes on a Linux second extended file system.
<P>

The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[ASacDdIijsTtu].
<P>

The operator `+' causes the selected attributes to be added to the
existing attributes of the files; `-' causes them to be removed; and
`=' causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.
<P>

The letters `acdijsuADST' select the new attributes for the files: 
append only (a), compressed (c), no dump (d), immutable (i),
data journalling (j), secure deletion (s), no tail-merging (t), 
undeletable (u), no atime updates (A), synchronous directory updates (D), 
synchronous updates (S), and top of directory hierarchy (T).
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Recursively change attributes of directories and their contents.
Symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals are
ignored.
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
Be verbose with chattr's output and print the program version.
<DT><B>-v</B><I> version</I>

<DD>
Set the file's version/generation number.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ATTRIBUTES</H2>

When a file with the 'A' attribute set is accessed, its atime record is
not modified.  This avoids a certain amount of disk I/O for laptop
systems.
<P>

A file with the `a' attribute set can only be open in append mode for writing.
Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE 
capability can set or clear this attribute.
<P>

A file with the `c' attribute set is automatically compressed on the disk
by the kernel.  A read from this file returns uncompressed data.  A write to
this file compresses data before storing them on the disk.
<P>

When a directory with the `D' attribute set is modified,
the changes are written synchronously on the disk; this is equivalent to
the `dirsync' mount option applied to a subset of the files.
<P>

A file with the `d' attribute set is not candidate for backup when the
<B><A HREF="../man8/dump.8.php">dump</A></B>(8)

program is run.
<P>

The 'E' attribute is used by the experimental compression patches to 
indicate that a compressed file has a compression error.  It may not be
set or reset using 
<B><A HREF="../man1/chattr.1.php">chattr</A></B>(1),

although it can be displayed by
<B><A HREF="../man1/lsattr.1.php">lsattr</A></B>(1).

<P>

The 'I' attribute is used by the htree code to indicate that a directory
is behind indexed using hashed trees.  It may not be set or reset using 
<B><A HREF="../man1/chattr.1.php">chattr</A></B>(1),

although it can be displayed by
<B><A HREF="../man1/lsattr.1.php">lsattr</A></B>(1).

<P>

A file with the `i' attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or
renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data can be written
to the file.  Only the superuser or a process possessing the
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute.
<P>

A file with the `j' attribute has all of its data written to the ext3
journal before being written to the file itself, if the filesystem is
mounted with the &quot;data=ordered&quot; or &quot;data=writeback&quot; options.  When the
filesystem is mounted with the &quot;data=journal&quot; option all file data
is already journalled and this attribute has no effect.  
Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability can set or clear this attribute.
<P>

When a file with the `s' attribute set is deleted, its blocks are zeroed and
written back to the disk.
<P>

When a file with the `S' attribute set is modified,
the changes are written synchronously on the disk; this is equivalent to
the `sync' mount option applied to a subset of the files.
<P>

A directory with the 'T' attribute will be deemed to be the top of 
directory hierarchies for the purposes of the Orlov block allocator
(which is used in on systems with Linux 2.5.46 or later).
<P>

A file with the 't' attribute will not have a partial block fragment at
the end of the file merged with other files (for those filesystems which
support tail-merging).  This is necessary for applications such as LILO 
which read the filesystem directly, and which don't understand tail-merged
files.  Note: As of this writing, the ext2 or ext3 filesystems do not
(yet, except in very experimental patches) support tail-merging.
<P>

When a file with the `u' attribute set is deleted, its contents are saved.
This allows the user to ask for its undeletion.
<P>

The 'X' attribute is used by the experimental compression patches to 
indicate that a raw contents of a compressed file can be accessed
directly.  It currently may not be set or reset using 
<B><A HREF="../man1/chattr.1.php">chattr</A></B>(1),

although it can be displayed by
<B><A HREF="../man1/lsattr.1.php">lsattr</A></B>(1).

<P>

The 'Z' attribute is used by the experimental compression patches to 
indicate a compressed file is dirty.  It may not be set or reset using 
<B><A HREF="../man1/chattr.1.php">chattr</A></B>(1),

although it can be displayed by
<B><A HREF="../man1/lsattr.1.php">lsattr</A></B>(1).

<H2>AUTHOR</H2>

<B>chattr</B>

was written by Remy Card &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Remy.Card@linux.org">Remy.Card@linux.org</A>&gt;.  It is currently being
maintained by Theodore Ts'o &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tytso@alum.mit.edu">tytso@alum.mit.edu</A>&gt;.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS</H2>

The `c', 's',  and `u' attributes are not honored 
by the ext2 and ext3 filesystems as implemented in the current mainline
Linux kernels.    These attributes may be implemented
in future versions ext2 and ext3.
<P>

The `j' option is only useful if the filesystem is mounted as ext3.
<P>

The `D' option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and later.
