<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

<B>talk</B>

 - talk to another user

<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>talk</B>

<I>person</I>

[<I>ttyname</I>

]

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Talk</B>

is a visual communication program which copies lines from your
terminal to that of another user.
<P>

Options available:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B></B><I>person</I>


<DD>
If you wish to talk to someone on your own machine, then
<I>person</I>

is just the person's login name.  If you wish to talk to a user on
another host, then
<I>person</I>

is of the form
`<A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>'

<DT><B></B><I>ttyname</I>


<DD>
If you wish to talk to a user who is logged in more than once, the
<I>ttyname</I>

argument may be used to indicate the appropriate terminal
name, where
<I>ttyname</I>

is of the form
`ttyXX'

or
`pts/X'

</DL>
<P>

<P>

When first called,
<B>talk</B>

contacts the talk daemon on the other user's machine, which sends the
message

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
Message from <A HREF="mailto:TalkDaemon@his_machine..">TalkDaemon@his_machine..</A>.
talk: connection requested by <A HREF="mailto:your_name@your_machine">your_name@your_machine</A>.
talk: respond with: talk <A HREF="mailto:your_name@your_machine">your_name@your_machine</A>
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

to that user. At this point, he then replies by typing
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>talk &nbsp;<A HREF="mailto:your_name@your_machine">your_name@your_machine</A></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

It doesn't matter from which machine the recipient replies, as
long as his login name is the same.  Once communication is established,
the two parties may type simultaneously; their output will appear
in separate windows.  Typing control-L (^L)

will cause the screen to
be reprinted. The erase, kill line, and word erase characters
(normally ^H, ^U, and ^W respectively)
will behave normally.  To exit, just type the interrupt character
(normally ^C);
<B>talk</B>

then moves the cursor to the bottom of the screen and restores the
terminal to its previous state.
<P>

As of netkit-ntalk 0.15
<B>talk</B>

supports scrollback; use esc-p and esc-n to scroll your window, and
ctrl-p and ctrl-n to scroll the other window. These keys are now
opposite from the way they were in 0.16; while this will probably be
confusing at first, the rationale is that the key combinations with 
escape are harder to type and should therefore be used to scroll one's
own screen, since one needs to do that much less often.
<P>

If you do not want to receive talk requests, you may block them using the
<A HREF="../man1/mesg.1.php">mesg</A>(1)


command.  By default, talk requests are normally not blocked.
Certain commands, in particular
<A HREF="../man1/nroff.1.php">nroff</A>(1),


<A HREF="../man1/pine.1.php">pine</A>(1),


and
<A HREF="../man1/pr.1.php">pr</A>(1),


may block messages temporarily in order to
prevent messy output.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

The protocol used to communicate with the talk daemon is braindead.
<P>

Also, the version of
<A HREF="../man1/talk.1.php">talk</A>(1)


released with
BSD 4.2
uses a different and even more braindead protocol that is completely
incompatible. Some vendor Unixes (particularly those from Sun) have
been found to use this old protocol.
<P>

Old versions of
<B>talk</B>

may have trouble running on machines with more than one IP address,
such as machines with dynamic SLIP or PPP connections. This problem is
fixed as of netkit-ntalk 0.11, but may affect people you are trying to
communicate with.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>

The
<B>talk</B>


command appeared in
BSD 4.2
