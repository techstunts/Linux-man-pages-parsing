<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Isdnrep reads the isdnlog log files, generates reports, does statistics,
and other things. It can also generate HTML output for use with a web
server.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
show version information and exit.
<P>
<DT><B>-a<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>all</B>

<DD>

not given, show only the connections made today.
<P>
<DT><B>-S<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>Summary</B>

<DD>
Show a summary (no individual calls) for selected date range. If this<BR>
option is given twice, the summaries per day are hidden too. Don't use with
<B>-h</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-h<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>no header</B>

<DD>
There will be no header for each day, nor will the summary at the end<BR>
of each day and at the end of the report be generated. This is useful
if the output is to be processed by another program.
<BR>

This option doesn't work if the
<B>-wX</B>

is also given.
<P>
<DT><B>-n<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>numbers</B>

<DD>
Display numbers instead of the aliases for those numbers.<BR>
<P>
<DT><B>-fFILE</B>

<DD>
The file from which to generate the report. This is usually
/var/log/isdn.log, or whatever is configured in /etc/isdn/isdn.conf as
<B>LOGFILE = .</B>

The -f option will override the setting in /etc/isdn/isdn.conf.
<P>
<DT><B>-t time span<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>time=time span</B>

<DD>
With this option a specific time span covered by the log file can be<BR>
displayed, e.g. all calls in November 1995, or on January 3rd 1996
between 03:00 and 09:45.
<P>
The format in which times are given is described below.
The time span has the following syntax:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>time-time<DD>
display from begin time up to end time
<DT>time-<DD>
display from given time up to &quot;now&quot;
<DT>-time<DD>
display from beginning of log file up to given time
<DT>time<DD>
display the given month, day, hour, ...
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-d -time<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>delete=time</B>

<DD>
Delete entries from the log file up to (but not including) the specified<BR>
time. The format is the same as for the -t option.
The minus before the time
<B>must</B>

be given! It is not possible to define begin and end times; entries are
always deleted from the beginning up to the time given.
<P>
<B>Warning!</B>

Entries are
<B>really</B>

deleted from the file. Careless use can result in all entries being
deleted, e.g. with &quot;isdnrep -d -&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>-E<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>print Errors</B>

<DD>
Display all connections and connection attempts. Without this option,<BR>
only successful connections are displayed.
<P>
<DT><B>-v<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>verbose</B>

<DD>
Display warnings on startup.<BR>
<P>
<DT><B>-p [n][m]'number'[,[m]'number'...]<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>phonenumber</B>

<DD>
Display only selected phone numbers.<BR>
<P>
&quot;number&quot; is specified in the same format as in configuration files
(see <A HREF="../man5/isdn.conf.5.php">isdn.conf</A>(5)). E.g. wildcards can be used.
<P>
If the flag 'm' is given, the corresponding MSN is meant.
E.g.: &quot;m2&quot; means MSN#2. If &quot;m0&quot; is given, all numbers are to be displayed.
<P>
If the flag 'n' is given, the given number is
<B>not</B>

to be displayed.
<P>
<DT><B>-i<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>incoming</B>

<DD>
Only incoming connections are displayed.<BR>
<P>
<DT><B>-o<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>outgoing</B>

<DD>
Only outgoing connections are displayed.<BR>
<P>
<DT><B>-u<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>unknown caller</B>

<DD>
At the end of the report, all numbers not aliased in callerid.conf or<BR>
~/.isdn are displayed. This option is not available when HTML output
is requested.
<P>
<DT><B>-wX<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>WWW</B>

<DD>
isdnrep can give its output in HTML format; this is switched on with<BR>
this option. Two modes are possible:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0<DD>
The HTML header is suppressed. Useful if the output is to be included
into an existing page.
<DT>1<DD>
A complete HTML page is generated.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DT><B>-sX<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>format string</B>

<DD>
The output generated by isdnrep can be modified by specifying the format<BR>
of the line generated for each connection. The syntax is similar to that
used by printf. The following parameters are possible (the <B>x</B> where
given means that a width for the field, also known as the precision, must
be given):
<P>

</DL>
</DL>

<P>

The default format string for (non-HTML output) is
<P>

&quot;  %X %D %15.15H %T %-15.15F %7u %U %I %O&quot;

<P>
With the following string all the important data is displayed while
keeping the total length to 80:
<P>

&quot;%X%D %10.10H%T%-14.14F%U%I %O&quot;

<P>
The above string is put into isdn.conf at installation as
<B>REPFMTSHORT</B>

and can be used with
<B>-Fshort.</B>

<P>

<DT><B>-FX<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>format</B>

<DD>
format strings can be specified in isdn.conf; this option<BR>
is used to select one of these. Entries can be defined in the
section [ISDNLOG] with names beginning with &quot;REPFMT&quot;. The string after
the -F option is added to REPFMT to find the correct entry. Case is
not sensitive. E.g.:
<P>
<PRE>
REPFMT1        = ... # -&gt; isdnrep -F1
REPFMTMYSTRING = ... # -&gt; isdnrep -Fmystring or
                          isdnrep -F MYSTRING
</PRE>

<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HTML USE</H2>

isdnrep can generate a HTML page containing links to files generated
by vbox and mgetty (faxes), so that the messages and faxes can be heard
or seen from within a browser. However, a couple of things need to be
configured first.
<P>

answering machine messages
<P>
The %C can be used in the isdnrep output format to make a link to a voice
recording file.
For this to work, the following entry is needed in the [ISDNLOG] section
in isdn.conf:
<P>
<PRE>
    VBOXPATH= /var/spool/vbox/fred/incoming # incoming directory pathname
</PRE>

<P>
Now isdnrep can find the file correctly. Clicking on this link
will cause the file to be sent. These files are in ZyXEL format; the
browser cannot use these directly. The type is given by isdnrep as
follows:
<P>
<PRE>
    Content-Type: application/x-zyxel4
</PRE>

<P>
The correct application (helper) for this has to be configured in the
browser. Alternatively, a conversion program can be specified to isdnrep
which will convert the ZyXEL format. The pathname of the file to convert
is given as a parameter to the program.
<P>
In the [ISDNLOG] section of isdn.conf an entry as follows specifies
which conversion program to use:
<P>
<PRE>
    VBOXCMD1 = /usr/bin/program1

for versions 0.x and 1.x of vbox, and

    VBOXCMD2 = /usr/bin/program2
</PRE>

<P>
for versions 2.x of vbox. Both entries can be given, isdnrep recognizes
which version created the recording.
<P>
The program must first output a line with the content-type, followed
by the data itself. To convert the ZyXEL format into a WAV file, the
following script may be used:
<P>

<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
##
## script to play voice messages from vbox-2.0
##
## WARNING! If the paths are not set correctly,
## netscape may simply crash!

PATH=$PATH:&quot;path to sox&quot;:&quot;path to pvftools&quot;:&quot;path to vbox&quot;
FILENAME1=/tmp/voxplay.$$.voc
FILENAME2=/tmp/voxplay.$$.wav
VOLUME=8

vboxtoau &lt;$1             | \
          autopvf        | \
          pvfamp $VOLUME | \
          pvfcut 0.20    | \
                pvftovoc &gt; $FILENAME1

sox $FILENAME1 $FILENAME2

echo Content-Type: audio/x-wav
echo
cat $FILENAME2

rm -f $FILENAME1 $FILENAME2

</PRE>


The script above needs the packages sox and pvftools.
Additionally, the browser needs to be told how to handle &quot;audio/x-wav&quot;.
This is done by adding the following lines to the files listed:
<P>
<PRE>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD><DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>~/.mime.types</B>
<DD>type=audio/x-wav    \
desc=&quot;auWAV Audio&quot;  \
exts=&quot;wav&quot;

<DT><B>~/.mailcap</B>
<DD>audio/x-wav;/usr/bin/auplay %s
</DL>
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
The package NAS (Network Audio System) may be needed.
<P>
Now, when the browser is started, it will recognize WAV files and start
the corresponding program to handle these. The WAV format has been chosen
as this can also be played from a Windows pc.
<P>
<P>

faxes received by mgetty
<P>
When %G is used in the isdnrep output format, any faxes received by mgetty
will be accessible via a HTML link, in the same manner as the ansering
machine messages.
<P>
For the faxes the following entry in the [ISDNLOG] section in isdn.conf
is needed:
<P>
<PRE>
    MGETTYPATH = /var/spool/fax/incoming
</PRE>

<P>
WARNING: if isdnrep doesn't have permission to read the files, they
will not be displayed; there will be no error message.
<P>
When isdnrep passes these files back to the browser, they have the
G3 format. The following header is used to notify the browser of this:
<P>
<PRE>
    Content-Type: application/x-faxg3
</PRE>

<P>
As the browser probably doesn't understand this format, the following
changes to the files listed are needed:
<P>
<PRE>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD><DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>~/.mime.types</B>
<DD>type=application/x-faxg3  \
desc=&quot;G3-Fax Format&quot;      \
exts=&quot;fax,g3&quot;

<DT><B>~/.mailcap</B>
<DD>pplication/x-faxg3;/usr/X11/bin/g3view %s
</DL>
</DL>
</PRE>

<P>
The program g3view has to be installed for this to work.
<P>
If now the link is clicked on, the browser will automatically start
the external g3view to handle this data.
<P>
If you prefer another format (instead of G3) such as JPEG, the format
has to be converted. The following entry in the [ISDNLOG] section of
isdn.conf takes care of this:
<P>
<PRE>
VBOXCMD = /usr/bin/g3tojpeg # example
</PRE>

<P>
The script g3tojpeg can be something like this:
<P>

<PRE>
#! /bin/sh
##
## command to display faxes in a browser
##
## WARNING! If the paths are not set correctly,
## netscape may simply crash!

export PATH=$PATH:&quot;path to g3topbm&quot;:&quot;path to convert&quot;

echo Content-Type: image/jpeg
echo

g3topbm &lt; $1 | convert pbm:- jpeg:-
</PRE>


<P>
The packages ImageMagick and mgetty are needed. Mgetty is probably
already installed if you want to use this feature :-)
<P>
The advantage of the JPEG format is that it can also be displayed by
a browser running on a Windows pc.
<P>

summary
<P>
A suitable value for REPFMTWWW is
<P>
<PRE>
    REPFMTWWW = &quot;%X %D %17.17H %T %-17.17F %-20.20l SI: %S %9u %U %I %O %G %C&quot;
</PRE>

<P>
Netscape 3.0 Gold and Arena have been tested, and both work fine
with isdnrep's HTML output, although Arena's display is not as
colourful as Netscape's.
<P>
A known problem (which is impossible to solve completely) is determining
the relationship between an isdn connection and a fax or vbox recording.
Unfortunately the times for isdnrep, mgetty and vbox differ. Isdnrep tries
to make the best guess, but it's always possible that e.g. a fax is
connected to the wrong isdn connection.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE OUTPUT</H2>

With the default configuration the following output can be generated
on stdout (whitespace slightly edited for clarity):
