<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>telnet</B>


command
is used to communicate with another host using the
<B>TELNET</B>

protocol.
If
<B>telnet</B>


is invoked without the
<I>host</I>

argument, it enters command mode,
indicated by its prompt
(<B>telnet&gt;</B>

)

 
In this mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below.
If it is invoked with arguments, it performs an
<B>open</B>

command with those arguments.
<P>

The options are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>-7</B>


<DD>
Strip 8th bit on input and output. Telnet is 8-bit clean by default but doesn't send the TELNET BINARY option unless forced.
<DT><B>-8</B>


<DD>
Specifies an 8-bit data path.
This causes an attempt to negotiate the
<B>TELNET BINARY</B>

option on both input and output.
<DT><B>-E</B>


<DD>
Stops any character from being recognized as an escape character.
<DT><B>-F</B>


<DD>
If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the
-<B>F</B>

option allows the local credentials to be forwarded
to the remote system, including any credentials that
have already been forwarded into the local environment.
<DT><B>-K</B>


<DD>
Specifies no automatic login to the remote system.
<DT><B>-L</B>


<DD>
Specifies an 8-bit data path on output.
This causes the BINARY option to be negotiated on output.
<DT><B>-X </B><I>atype</I>




<DD>
Disables the
<I>atype</I>

type of authentication.
<DT><B>-a</B>


<DD>
Attempt automatic login.
Currently, this sends the user name via the
<B>USER</B>

variable
of the
<B>ENVIRON</B>

option if supported by the remote system.
The name used is that of the current user as returned by
<A HREF="../man2/getlogin.2.php">getlogin</A>(2)


if it agrees with the current user ID,
otherwise it is the name associated with the user ID.
<DT><B>-b </B><I>hostalias</I>




<DD>
Uses
<A HREF="../man2/bind.2.php">bind</A>(2)


on the local socket to bind it to an aliased address (see
<A HREF="../man8/ifconfig.8.php">ifconfig</A>(8)


and the ``alias'' specifier) or to the address of
another interface than the one naturally chosen by
<A HREF="../man2/connect.2.php">connect</A>(2).


This can be useful when connecting to services which use IP addresses
for authentication and reconfiguration of the server is undesirable (or
impossible).
<DT><B>-c</B>


<DD>
Disables the reading of the user's
.telnetrc

file.
(See the
<B>toggle skiprc</B>

command on this man page.)
<DT><B>-d</B>


<DD>
Sets the initial value of the
<B>debug</B>

toggle to
<B>TRUE</B>

 
<DT><B>-e </B><I>escapechar</I>




<DD>
Sets the initial
<B>telnet</B>


escape character to
<I>escapechar </I><B></B>



If
<I>escapechar</I>

is omitted, then
there will be no escape character.
<DT><B>-f</B>


<DD>
If Kerberos V5 authentication is being used, the
-<B>f</B>

option allows the local credentials to be forwarded to the remote system.
<DT><B>-k </B><I>realm</I>




<DD>
If Kerberos authentication is being used, the
-<B>k</B>

option requests that
<B>telnet</B>


obtain tickets for the remote host in
realm
<I>realm</I>

instead of the remote host's realm, as determined
by
krb_realmofhost3.


<DT><B>-l </B><I>user</I>




<DD>
When connecting to the remote system, if the remote system
understands the
<B>ENVIRON</B>

option, then
<I>user</I>

will be sent to the remote system as the value for the variable USER.
This option implies the
-<B>a</B>

option.
This option may also be used with the
<B>open</B>

command.
<DT><B>-n </B><I>tracefile</I>




<DD>
Opens
<I>tracefile</I>

for recording trace information.
See the
<B>set tracefile</B>

command below.
<DT><B>-r</B>


<DD>
Specifies a user interface similar to
<A HREF="../man1/rlogin.1.php">rlogin</A>(1).


In this
mode, the escape character is set to the tilde (~) character,
unless modified by the
-<B>e</B>

option.
<DT><B>-x</B>


<DD>
Turns on encryption of the data stream if possible.
<DT><B></B><I>host</I>


<DD>
Indicates the official name, an alias, or the Internet address
of a remote host.
<DT><B></B><I>port</I>


<DD>
Indicates a port number (address of an application).
If a number is not specified, the default
<B>telnet</B>


port is used.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

When in rlogin mode, a line of the form ~.
disconnects from the
remote host; ~ is the telnet escape character.
Similarly, the line ~^Z suspends the telnet session.
The line ~^] escapes to the normal telnet escape prompt.
<P>

Once a connection has been opened,
<B>telnet</B>


will attempt to enable the
<B>TELNET LINEMODE</B>

option.
If this fails,
<B>telnet</B>


will revert to one of two input modes:
either ``character at a time''
or ``old line by line''
depending on what the remote system supports.
<P>

When
<B>LINEMODE</B>

is enabled, character processing is done on the
local system, under the control of the remote system.
When input
editing or character echoing is to be disabled, the remote system
will relay that information.
The remote system will also relay
changes to any special characters that happen on the remote
system, so that they can take effect on the local system.
<P>

In ``character at a time'' mode, most
text typed is immediately sent to the remote host for processing.
<P>

In ``old line by line'' mode, all text is echoed locally,
and (normally) only completed lines are sent to the remote host.
The ``local echo character'' (initially ``^E'') may be used
to turn off and on the local echo
(this would mostly be used to enter passwords
without the password being echoed).
<P>

If the
<B>LINEMODE</B>

option is enabled, or if the
<B>localchars</B>

toggle is
<B>TRUE</B>

(the default for ``old line by line''; see below),
the user's
<B>quit</B>

 
<B>intr</B>

 
and
<B>flush</B>

characters are trapped locally, and sent as
<B>TELNET</B>

protocol sequences to the remote side.
If
<B>LINEMODE</B>

has ever been enabled, then the user's
<B>susp</B>

and
<B>eof</B>

are also sent as
<B>TELNET</B>

protocol sequences,
and
<B>quit</B>

is sent as a
<B>TELNET ABORT</B>

instead of
<B>BREAK</B>

 
There are options (see
<B>toggle</B>

<B>autoflush</B>

and
<B>toggle</B>

<B>autosynch</B>

below)
which cause this action to flush subsequent output to the terminal
(until the remote host acknowledges the
<B>TELNET</B>

sequence) and flush previous terminal input
(in the case of
<B>quit</B>

and
<B>intr )</B>

 
<P>

While connected to a remote host,
<B>telnet</B>


command mode may be entered by typing the
<B>telnet</B>


``escape character'' (initially ``^]'').
When in command mode, the normal terminal editing conventions are available.
Note that the escape character will return to the command mode of the initial
invocation of
<B>telnet</B>


that has the controlling terminal.
Use the
<B>send escape</B>

command to switch to command mode in subsequent
<B>telnet</B>


processes on remote hosts.
<P>

The following
<B>telnet</B>


commands are available.
Only enough of each command to uniquely identify it need be typed
(this is also true for arguments to the
<B>mode</B>

 
<B>set</B>

 
<B>toggle</B>

 
<B>unset</B>

 
<B>slc</B>

<P>

<DT><B>environ </B><I>arguments </I>[<I>...</I>

]






<DD>
The
<B>environ</B>

command is used to manipulate the
variables that may be sent through the
<B>TELNET ENVIRON</B>

option.
The initial set of variables is taken from the users
environment, with only the
<B>DISPLAY</B>

and
<B>PRINTER</B>

variables being exported by default.
The
<B>USER</B>

variable is also exported if the
-<B>a</B>

or
-<B>l</B>

options are used.
<BR>

Valid arguments for the
<B>environ</B>

command are:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>define </B><I>variable value</I>




<DD>
Define the variable
<I>variable</I>

to have a value of
<I>value</I>

 
Any variables defined by this command are automatically exported.
The
<I>value</I>

may be enclosed in single or double quotes so
that tabs and spaces may be included.

<B>*</B>

will be sent automatically,
other variables will only be sent if explicitly requested.
<DT><B>?</B>


<DD>
Prints out help information for the
<B>environ</B>

command.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><B>logout</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET LOGOUT</B>

option to the remote side.
This command is similar to a
<B>close</B>

command; however, if the remote side does not support the
<B>LOGOUT</B>

option, nothing happens.
If, however, the remote side does support the
<B>LOGOUT</B>

option, this command should cause the remote side to close the
<B>TELNET</B>

connection.
If the remote side also supports the concept of
suspending a user's session for later reattachment,
the logout argument indicates that you
should terminate the session immediately.
<DT><B>mode </B><I>type</I>




<DD>
<I>type</I>

is one of several options, depending on the state of the
<B>TELNET</B>

session.
The remote host is asked for permission to go into the requested mode.
If the remote host is capable of entering that mode, the requested
mode will be entered.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

]

[[-

]


<I>port </I>]


<DD>

<DD>Open a connection to the named host.
If no port number
is specified,
<B>telnet</B>


will attempt to contact a
<B>TELNET</B>

server at the default port.
The host specification may be either a host name (see
<A HREF="../man5/hosts.5.php">hosts</A>(5))


or an Internet address specified in the ``dot notation'' (see
<A HREF="../man3/inet.3.php">inet</A>(3)).


The
-<B>l</B>

option may be used to specify the user name
to be passed to the remote system via the
<B>ENVIRON</B>

option.
When connecting to a non-standard port,
<B>telnet</B>


omits any automatic initiation of
<B>TELNET</B>

options.
When the port number is preceded by a minus sign,
the initial option negotiation is done.
After establishing a connection, the file
.telnetrc

in the
user's home directory is opened.
Lines beginning with a ``#'' are
comment lines.
Blank lines are ignored.
Lines that begin
without whitespace are the start of a machine entry.
The first thing on the line is the name of the machine that is
being connected to.
The rest of the line, and successive
lines that begin with whitespace are assumed to be
<B>telnet</B>


commands and are processed as if they had been typed
in manually to the
<B>telnet</B>


command prompt.
<DT><B>quit</B>


<DD>
Close any open
<B>TELNET</B>

session and exit
<B>telnet</B>

 
An end-of-file (in command mode) will also close a session and exit.
<DT><B>send </B><I>arguments</I>




<DD>
Sends one or more special character sequences to the remote host.
The following are the arguments which may be specified
(more than one argument may be specified at a time):
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>abort</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET ABORT</B>

(Abort
processes)
sequence.
<DT><B>ao</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET AO</B>

(Abort Output) sequence, which should cause the remote system to flush
all output
<I>from</I>

the remote system
<I>to</I>

the user's terminal.
<DT><B>ayt</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET AYT</B>

(Are You There)
sequence, to which the remote system may or may not choose to respond.
<DT><B>brk</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET BRK</B>

(Break) sequence, which may have significance to the remote
system.
<DT><B>ec</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET EC</B>

(Erase Character)
sequence, which should cause the remote system to erase the last character
entered.
<DT><B>el</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET EL</B>

(Erase Line)
sequence, which should cause the remote system to erase the line currently
being entered.

<B>TELNET EOR</B>

(End of Record)
sequence.
<DT><B>escape</B>


<DD>
Sends the current
<B>telnet</B>


escape character (initially ``^]'').
<DT><B>ga</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET GA</B>

(Go Ahead)
sequence, which likely has no significance to the remote system.
<DT><B>getstatus</B>


<DD>
If the remote side supports the
<B>TELNET STATUS</B>

command,
<B>getstatus</B>

will send the subnegotiation to request that the server send
its current option status.
<DT><B>ip</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET IP</B>

(Interrupt Process) sequence, which should cause the remote
system to abort the currently running process.
<DT><B>nop</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET NOP</B>

(No OPeration)
sequence.
<DT><B>susp</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET SUSP</B>

(SUSPend process)
sequence.
<DT><B>synch</B>


<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET SYNCH</B>

sequence.
This sequence causes the remote system to discard all previously typed
(but not yet read) input.
This sequence is sent as
<B>TCP</B>

urgent
data (and may not work if the remote system is a
BSD 4.2
system -- if
it doesn't work, a lower case ``r'' may be echoed on the terminal).
<DT><B>do </B><I>cmd</I>




<DD>
Sends the
<B>TELNET DO</B>

<I>cmd</I>

</DL>
<P>

<DT><B>set </B><I>argument value</I>




<DD>
<DT><B>unset </B><I>argument value</I>




<DD>
The
<B>set</B>

command will set any one of a number of
<B>telnet</B>


variables to a specific value or to
<B>TRUE</B>

 
The special value
<B>off</B>

turns off the function associated with
the variable; this is equivalent to using the
<B>unset</B>

command.
The
<B>unset</B>

command will disable or set to
<B>FALSE</B>

any of the specified functions.
The values of variables may be interrogated with the
<B>display</B>

command.
The variables which may be set or unset, but not toggled, are
listed here.
In addition, any of the variables for the
<B>toggle</B>

command may be explicitly set or unset using
the
<B>set</B>

and
<B>unset</B>

commands.

The
<B>slc</B>

command (Set Local Characters) is used to set
or change the state of the special
characters when the
<B>TELNET LINEMODE</B>

option has
been enabled.
Special characters are characters that get mapped to
<B>TELNET</B>

commands sequences (like
<B>ip</B>

or
<B>quit</B>

 
or line editing characters (like
<B>erase</B>

<DD>
Toggle (between
<B>TRUE</B>

and
<B>FALSE</B>

 
various flags that control how
<B>telnet</B>


responds to events.
These flags may be set explicitly to
<B>TRUE</B>

or
<B>FALSE</B>

using the
<B>set</B>

and
<B>unset</B>

commands listed above.
More than one argument may be specified.
The state of these flags may be interrogated with the
<B>display</B>

command.
Valid arguments are:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>authdebug</B>


<DD>

<DT><B>autoflush</B>


<DD>
If
<B>autoflush</B>

and
<B>localchars</B>

are both
<B>TRUE</B>

 
then when the
<B>ao</B>

or
<B>quit</B>

characters are recognized (and transformed into
<B>TELNET</B>

sequences; see
<B>set</B>

above for details),
<B>telnet</B>


refuses to display any data on the user's terminal
until the remote system acknowledges (via a
<B>TELNET TIMING MARK</B>

option)
that it has processed those
<B>TELNET</B>

sequences.
The initial value for this toggle is
<B>TRUE</B>

if the terminal user had not
done an &quot;stty noflsh&quot;, otherwise
<B>FALSE</B>

(see
<A HREF="../man1/stty.1.php">stty</A>(1)).


<DT><B>autodecrypt</B>


<DD>
When the
<B>TELNET ENCRYPT</B>

option is negotiated, by
default the actual encryption (decryption) of the data
stream does not start automatically.
The
<B>autoencrypt</B>

(<B>autodecrypt</B>

)

command states that encryption of the
output (input) stream should be enabled as soon as
possible.
<P>

<DT><B>autologin</B>


<DD>
If the remote side supports the
<B>TELNET AUTHENTICATION</B>

option
<B>TELNET</B>

attempts to use it to perform automatic authentication.
If the
<B>AUTHENTICATION</B>

option is not supported, the user's login
name are propagated through the
<B>TELNET ENVIRON</B>

option.
This command is the same as specifying
<I>a</I>

option on the
<B>open</B>

command.
<DT><B>autosynch</B>


<DD>
If
<B>autosynch</B>

and
<B>localchars</B>

are both
<B>TRUE</B>

 
then when either the
<B>intr</B>

or
<B>quit</B>

character is typed (see
<B>set</B>

above for descriptions of the
<B>intr</B>

and
<B>quit</B>

characters), the resulting
<B>TELNET</B>

sequence sent is followed by the
<B>TELNET SYNCH</B>

sequence.
This procedure
<I>should</I>

cause the remote system to begin throwing away all previously
typed input until both of the
<B>TELNET</B>

sequences have been read and acted upon.
The initial value of this toggle is
<B>FALSE</B>

 
<DT><B>binary</B>

<B>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</B>

 
If this is
<B>FALSE</B>

 
then carriage returns will be send as
<B>&lt;CR&gt;&lt;NUL&gt;</B>

 
The initial value for this toggle is
<B>FALSE</B>

 
<DT><B>crmod</B>


<DD>
Toggle carriage return mode.
When this mode is enabled, most carriage return characters received from
the remote host will be mapped into a carriage return followed by
a line feed.
This mode does not affect those characters typed by the user, only
those received from the remote host.
This mode is not very useful unless the remote host
only sends carriage return, but never line feeds.
The initial value for this toggle is
<B>FALSE</B>

 
<DT><B>debug</B>

<B>interrupt</B>

 
<B>quit</B>

 
<B>erase</B>

 
and
<B>kill</B>

characters (see
<B>set</B>

above) are recognized locally, and transformed into (hopefully) appropriate
<B>TELNET</B>

control sequences
(respectively
<B>ao</B>

 
<B>ip</B>

 
<B>brk</B>

 
<B>ec</B>

 
and
<B>el</B>

 
see

<B>TRUE</B>

in ``old line by line'' mode,
and
<B>FALSE</B>

in ``character at a time'' mode.
When the
<B>LINEMODE</B>

option is enabled, the value of
<B>localchars</B>

is ignored, and assumed to always be
<B>TRUE</B>

 
If
<B>LINEMODE</B>

has ever been enabled, then
<B>quit</B>

is sent as
<B>abort</B>

 
and
<B>eof</B>

and
<B>suspend</B>

are sent as
<B>eof</B>
