<H2>NAME</H2>

mt - control magnetic tape drive operation
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>mt</B>

[-h] [-f device] operation [count] [arguments...]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This manual page documents the tape control program
<B>mt</B>.

<B>mt</B>

performs the given
<I>operation</I>,

which must be one of the tape operations listed below, on a tape
drive. The commands can also be listed by running the program with the
<I>-h</I>

option. The version of mt is printed with the
<I>-v</I>

or
<I>--version</I>

option. The path of the tape device on which to operate can be given with
the
<I>-f</I>

or
<I>-t</I>

option.  If neither of those options is given, and the environment
variable
<B>TAPE</B>

is set, it is used.  Otherwise, a default device defined in the file
<I>/usr/include/sys/mtio.h</I>

is used.
<P>

Some operations optionally take an argument or repeat count, which can be given
after the operation name and defaults to 1. The postfix
<I>k</I>

,
<I>M</I>

, or
<I>G</I>

can be used to give counts in units of 1024, 1024 * 1024, or 1024 *
1024 * 1024, respectively.
<P>

The available operations are listed below.  Unique abbreviations are
accepted.  Not all operations are available on all systems, or work on
all types of tape drives.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>fsf<DD>
Forward space
<I>count</I>

files.
The tape is positioned on the first block of the next file.
<DT>fsfm<DD>
Forward space
<I>count</I>

files.
The tape is positioned on the last block of the previous file.
<DT>bsf<DD>
Backward space
<I>count</I>

files.
The tape is positioned on the last block of the previous file.
<DT>bsfm<DD>
Backward space
<I>count</I>

files.
The tape is positioned on the first block of the next file.
<DT>asf<DD>
The tape is positioned at the beginning of the
<I>count</I>

file. Positioning is done by first rewinding the tape and then spacing
forward over
<I>count</I>

filemarks.
<DT>fsr<DD>
Forward space
<I>count</I>

records.
<DT>bsr<DD>
Backward space
<I>count</I>

records.
<DT>fss<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Forward space
<I>count</I>

setmarks.
<DT>bss<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Backward space
<I>count</I>

setmarks.
<DT>eod, seod<DD>
Space to end of valid data.  Used on streamer tape
drives to append data to the logical end of tape.
<DT>rewind<DD>
Rewind the tape.
<DT>offline, rewoffl, eject<DD>
Rewind the tape and, if applicable, unload the tape.
<DT>retension<DD>
Rewind the tape, then wind it to the end of the reel,
then rewind it again.
<DT>weof, eof<DD>
Write
<I>count</I>

EOF marks at current position.
<DT>wset<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Write
<I>count</I>

setmarks at current position (only SCSI tape).
<DT>erase<DD>
Erase the tape.
<DT>status<DD>
Print status information about the tape unit. (If the density code is
&quot;no translation&quot; in the status output, this does not affect working of the
tape drive.)
<DT>seek<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Seek to the
<I>count</I>

block on the tape.  This operation is available on some
Tandberg and Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives. The block
address should be obtained from a
<I>tell</I>

call earlier.
<DT>tell<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Tell the current block on tape.  This operation is available on some
Tandberg and Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives.
<DT>setpartition<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Switch to the partition determined by
<I>count.</I>

The default data partition of the tape is numbered zero. Switching
partition is available only if enabled for the device, the device
supports multiple partitions, and the tape is formatted with multiple
partitions.
<DT>partseek<DD>
(SCSI tapes) The tape position is set to block
<I>count</I>

in the partition given by the argument after count. The default
partition is zero.
<DT>mkpartition<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Format the tape with one (count is zero) or two partitions
(count gives the size of the second partition in megabytes). The tape
drive must be able to format partitioned tapes with
initiator-specified partition size and partition support
must be enabled for the drive.
<DT>load<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Send the load command to the tape drive. The drives usually load the
tape when a new cartridge is inserted. The argument
<I>count</I>

can usually be omitted. Some HP changers load tape n if the
<I>count</I>

10000 + n is given (a special funtion in the Linux st driver).
<DT>lock<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Lock the tape drive door.
<DT>unlock<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Unlock the tape drive door.
<DT>setblk<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set the block size of the drive to
<I>count</I>

bytes per record.
<DT>setdensity<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set the tape density code to
<I>count.</I>

The proper codes to use with each drive should be looked up from the
drive documentation.
<DT>densities<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Write explanation of some common density codes to
standard output.
<DT>drvbuffer<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set the tape drive buffer code to
<I>number.</I>

The proper value for unbuffered operation is zero and &quot;normal&quot; buffered
operation one. The meanings of other values can be found in the drive
documentation or, in the case of a SCSI-2 drive, from the SCSI-2 standard.
<DT>compression<DD>
(SCSI tapes) The compression within the drive can be switched on or
off using the MTCOMPRESSION ioctl. Note that this method is not
supported by all drives implementing compression. For instance, the
Exabyte 8 mm drives use density codes to select compression.
<DT>stoptions<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set the driver options bits for the device to the defined
values. Allowed only for the superuser. The bits can be set
either by ORing the option bits from the file /usr/include/linux/mtio.h to
<I>count,</I>

or by using the following keywords (as many keywords can be used on
the same line as necessary, unambiguous abbreviations allowed):
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>buffer-writes<DD>
buffered writes enabled
<DT>async-writes<DD>
asynchronous writes enabled
<DT>read-ahead<DD>
read-ahead for fixed block size
<DT>debug<DD>
debugging (if compiled into driver)
<DT>two-fms<DD>
write two filemarks when file closed
<DT>fast-eod<DD>
space directly to eod (and lose file number)
<DT>no-wait<DD>
don't wait until rewind, etc. complete
<DT>auto-lock<DD>
automatically lock/unlock drive door
<DT>def-writes<DD>
the block size and density are for writes
<DT>can-bsr<DD>
drive can space backwards as well
<DT>no-blklimits<DD>
drive doesn't support read block limits
<DT>can-partitions<DD>
drive can handle partitioned tapes
<DT>scsi2logical<DD>
seek and tell use SCSI-2 logical block addresses instead of device
dependent addresses
<DT>sysv<DD>
enable the System V semantics
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>stsetoptions<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set selected driver options bits.
The methods to specify the bits to set are given above in the
description of
<B>stoptions.</B>

Allowed only for the superuser.
<DT>stclearoptions<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Clear selected driver option bits.
The methods to specify the bits to clear are given above in description of
<B>stoptions.</B>

Allowed only for the superuser.
<DT>stwrthreshold<DD>
(SCSI tapes) The write threshold for the tape device is set to
<I>count</I>

kilobytes. The value must be smaller than or equal to the driver
buffer size. Allowed only for the superuser.
<DT>defblksize<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set the default block size of the device to
<I>count</I>

bytes. The value -1 disables the default block size.
The block size set by
<I>setblk</I>

overrides the default until a new tape is inserted.
Allowed only for the superuser.
<DT>defdensity<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set the default density code. The value -1 disables the
default density. The density set by
<I>setdensity</I>

overrides the default until a new tape is inserted. Allowed only for the
superuser.

(SCSI tapes) Set the default drive buffer code. The value -1 disables the
default drive buffer code. The drive buffer code set by
<I>drvbuffer</I>

overrides the default until a new tape is inserted. Allowed only for the
superuser.
<DT>defcompression<DD>
(SCSI tapes) Set the default compression state. The value -1 disables the
default compression. The compression state set by
<I>compression</I>

overrides the default until a new tape is inserted. Allowed only for the
superuser.
<DT>sttimeout<DD>
sets the normal timeout for the device. The value is given in
seconds. Allowed only for the superuser.
<DT>stlongtimeout<DD>
sets the long timeout for the device. The value is given in
seconds. Allowed only for the superuser.
<DT>stsetcln<DD>
set the cleaning request interpretation parameters.

<B>mt</B>

exits with a status of 0 if the operation succeeded, 1 if the
operation or device name given was invalid, or 2 if the operation
