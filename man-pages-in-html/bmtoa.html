<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <I>bitmap</I> program is a rudimentary tool for creating or editing
rectangular images made up of 1's and 0's.  Bitmaps are used in X for
defining clipping regions, cursor shapes, icon shapes, and tile and
stipple patterns.
<P>

The <I>bmtoa</I> and <I>atobm</I> filters convert <I>bitmap</I> files (FILE
FORMAT) to and from ASCII strings.  They are most commonly used to 
quickly print out bitmaps and to generate versions for including in text.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</H2>

<I>Bitmap</I> supports the standard X Toolkit command line arguments
(see <I><A HREF="../man1/X.1.php">X</A></I>(1)).  The following additional arguments are supported as well.

<H2>USAGE </H2>

<I>Bitmap</I> displays grid in which each square represents a single
bit in the picture being edited.  Actual size of the bitmap image, as
it would appear normaly and inverted, can be obtained by pressing<B>
Meta-I</B> key.  You are free to move the image popup out of the way to
continue editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in the popup window
or<B> Meta-I</B> again will remove the real size bitmap image.
<P>

If the bitmap is to be used for defining a cursor, one of the squares
in the images may be designated as the hot spot.  This determines
where the cursor is actually pointing.  For cursors with sharp tips
(such as arrows or fingers), this is usually at the end of the tip;
for symmetric cursors (such as crosses or bullseyes), this is usually
at the center.
<P>

Bitmaps are stored as small C code fragments suitable for including in
applications.  They provide an array of bits as well as symbolic
constants giving the width, height, and hot spot (if specified) that
may be used in creating cursors, icons, and tiles.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EDITING</H2>

To edit a bitmap image simply click on one of the buttons with drawing
commands (<B>Point, Curve, Line, Rectangle,</B> etc.) and move the
pointer into the bitmap grid  window.  Press one of the buttons on your
mouse and the appropriate action will take place.  You can either set,
clear or invert the gird squares.  Setting a grid square corresponds
to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 1.  Clearing a grid square
corresponds to setting a bit in the bitmap image to 0.  Inverting a
grid square corresponds to changing a bit in the bitmap image from 0 to
1 or 1 to 0, depending what its previous state was. The
default behavior of mouse buttons is as specified below.
<P>
<PRE>
                MouseButton1            Set
                MouseButton2            Invert
                MouseButton3            Clear
                MouseButton4            Clear
                MouseButton5            Clear
</PRE>

<P>
This default behavior can be changed by setting the button function
resources.  An example is provided below.
<P>
<PRE>
                bitmap*button1Function: Set
                bitmap*button2Function: Clear
                bitmap*button3Function: Invert
                etc.
</PRE>

<P>
The button function applies to all drawing commands, including copying,
moving and pasting, flood filling and setting the hot spot.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DRAWING COMMANDS</H2>

Here is the list of drawing commands accessible through the
buttons at the left side of the application's window.  Some commands
can be aborted by pressing A inside the bitmap window, allowing the
user to select different guiding points where applicable.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Clear</B>

<DD>
This command clears all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares
will be set to the background color.  Pressing C inside the bitmap
window has the same effect.
<DT><B>Set</B>

<DD>
This command sets all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares 
will be set to the foreground color.  Pressing S inside the bitmap
window has the same effect.
<DT><B>Invert</B>

<DD>
This command inverts all bits in the bitmap image.  The grid squares 
will be inverted appropriately.  Pressing I inside the bitmap window
has the same effect.
<DT><B>Mark</B>

<DD>
This command is used to mark an area of the grid by dragging out a
rectangular shape in the highlighting color.  Once the area is marked,
it can be operated on by a number of commands (see <B>Up, Down, Left,
Right, Rotate, Flip, Cut,</B> etc.)  Only one marked area can be present
at any time.  If you attempt to mark another area, the old mark will
vanish.  The same effect can be achieved by pressing<B>
Shift-MouseButton1</B> and dragging out a rectangle in the grid window.
Pressing<B> Shift-MouseButton2</B> will mark the entire grid area.
<DT><B>Unmark</B>

<DD>
This command will cause the marked area to vanish.  The same effect can 
be achieved by pressing<B> Shift-MouseButton3</B>.
<DT><B>Copy</B>

<DD>
This command is used to copy an area of the grid from one location to
another.  If there is no marked grid area displayed,<B> Copy</B>
behaves just like<B> Mark</B> described above.  Once there is a marked
grid area displayed in the highlighting color, this command has two
alternative behaviors.  If you click a mouse button inside the marked
area, you will be able to drag the rectangle that represents the
marked area to the desired location.  After you release the mouse
button, the area will be copied.  If you click outside the marked
area,<B> Copy</B> will assume that you wish to mark a different region of
the bitmap image, thus it will behave like<B> Mark</B> again.
<DT><B>Move</B>

<DD>
This command is used to move an area of the grid from one location to
another.  Its behavior resembles the behavior of<B> Copy</B> command,
except that the marked area will be moved instead of copied.
<DT><B>Flip Horizontally</B>

<DD>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the horizontal axes.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing H inside the bitmap window has the
same effect.
<DT><B>Up</B>

<DD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel up.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing UpArrow inside the bitmap window has the
same effect.
<DT><B>Flip Vertically</B>

<DD>
This command will flip the bitmap image with respect to the vertical axes.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing V inside the bitmap window has the
same effect.
<DT><B>Left</B>

<DD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the left.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing LeftArrow inside the bitmap window has
the same effect.
<DT><B>Fold</B>

<DD>
This command will fold the bitmap image so that the opposite corners 
become adjacent.  This is useful when creating bitmap images for
tiling.  Pressing F inside the bitmap window has the same effect.
<DT><B>Right</B>

<DD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel to the right.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing RightArrow inside the bitmap window
has the same effect.
<DT><B>Rotate Left</B>

<DD>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the left (counter 
clockwise.)
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing L inside the bitmap window has the
same effect.
<DT><B>Down</B>

<DD>
This command moves the bitmap image one pixel down.
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing DownArrow inside the bitmap window
has the same effect.
<DT><B>Rotate Right</B>

<DD>
This command rotates the bitmap image 90 degrees to the right (clockwise.)
If a marked area of the grid is highlighted, it will operate only 
inside the marked area.  Pressing R inside the bitmap window has the
same effect.
<DT><B>Point</B>

<DD>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if
a mouse button is being pressed down.  If you drag the mouse button 
continuously, the line may not be continuous, depending on the speed of your
system and frequency of mouse motion events.
<DT><B>Curve</B>

<DD>
This command will change the grid squares underneath the mouse pointer if
a mouse button is being pressed down.  If you drag the mouse button 
continuously, it will make sure that the line is continuous.  If your system
is slow or<I> bitmap</I> receives very few mouse motion events, it might
behave quite strangely.
<DT><B>Line</B>

<DD>
This command will change the gird squares in a line between two squares.
Once you press a mouse button in the grid window,<I> bitmap</I> will 
highlight the line from the square where the mouse button was initially
pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the
mouse button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted
line will disappear.
<DT><B>Rectangle</B>

<DD>
This command will change the gird squares in a rectangle between two squares.
Once you press a mouse button in the grid window,<I> bitmap</I> will 
highlight the rectangle from the square where the mouse button was initially
pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the
mouse button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted
rectangle will disappear.
<DT><B>Filled Rectangle</B>

<DD>
This command is identical to<B> Rectangle</B>, except at the end the
rectangle will be filled rather than outlined.
<DT><B>Circle</B>

<DD>
This command will change the gird squares in a circle between two squares.
Once you press a mouse button in the grid window,<I> bitmap</I> will 
highlight the circle from the square where the mouse button was initially
pressed to the square where the mouse pointer is located.  By releasing the
mouse button you will cause the change to take effect, and the highlighted
circle will disappear.
<DT><B>Filled Circle</B>

<DD>
This command is identical to<B> Circle</B>, except at the end the
circle will be filled rather than outlined.
<DT><B>Flood Fill</B>

<DD>
This command will flood fill the connected area underneath the mouse 
pointer when you click on the desired square.  Diagonally adjacent 
squares are not considered to be connected.
<DT><B>Set Hot Spot</B>

<DD>
This command designates one square in the grid as the hot spot if this 
bitmap image is to be used for defining a cursor.  Pressing a mouse button 
in the desired square will cause a diamond shape to be displayed.
<DT><B>Clear Hot Spot</B>

<DD>
This command removes any designated hot spot from the bitmap image.
<DT><B>Undo</B>

<DD>
This command will undo the last executed command.  It has depth one, 
that is, pressing<B> Undo</B> after<B> Undo</B> will undo itself.  
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILE MENU</H2>

The File menu commands can be accessed by pressing the File button and
selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by pressing Ctrl key with
another key.  These commands deal with files and global bitmap
parameters, such as size, basename, filename etc.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>New</B>

<DD>
This command will clear the editing area and prompt for the name of
the new file to be edited.  It will not load in the new file.
<DT><B>Load</B>

<DD>
This command is used to load a new bitmap file into the bitmap editor.
If the current image has not been saved, user will be asked whether to
save or ignore the changes.  The editor can edit only one file at a
time.  If you need interactive editing, run a number of editors and
use cut and paste mechanism as described below.
<DT><B>Insert</B>

<DD>
This command is used to insert a bitmap file into the image
being currently edited.  After being prompted for the filename,
click inside the grid window and drag the outlined rectangle to the
location where you want to insert the new file.
<DT><B>Save</B>

<DD>
This command will save the bitmap image.  It will not prompt for the
filename unless it is said to be &lt;none&gt;.  If you leave the filename
undesignated or -, the output will be piped to stdout.
<DT><B>Save As</B>

<DD>
This command will save the bitmap image after prompting for a new
filename.  It should be used if you want to change the filename.
<DT><B>Resize</B>

<DD>
This command is used to resize the editing area to the new number of
pixels.  The size should be entered in the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.  The
information in the image being edited will not be lost unless the new
size is smaller that the current image size. The editor was not
designed to edit huge files.  
<DT><B>Rescale</B>

<DD>
This command is used to rescale the editing area to the new width and
height.  The size should be entered in the WIDTHxHEIGHT format.  It will 
not do antialiasing and information will be lost if you rescale to the
smaller sizes.  Feel free to add you own algorithms for better rescaling.
<DT><B>Filename</B>

<DD>
This command is used to change the filename without changing the basename
nor saving the file.  If you specify - for a filename, the output will 
be piped to stdout.
<DT><B>Basename</B>

<DD>
This command is used to change the basename, if a different one from
the specified filename is desired.
<DT><B>Quit</B>

<DD>
This command will terminate the bitmap application.  If the file was
not saved, user will be prompted and asked whether to save the image
or not.  This command is preferred over killing the process.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EDIT MENU</H2>

The Edit menu commands can be accessed by pressing the Edit button and
selecting the appropriate menu entry, or by pressing Meta key with
another key.  These commands deal with editing facilities such as
grid, axes, zooming, cut and paste, etc.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Image</B>

<DD>
This command will display the image being edited and its inverse in its 
actual size in a separate window.  The window can be moved away to continue
with editing.  Pressing the left mouse button in the image window will
cause it to disappear from the screen.
<DT><B>Grid</B>

<DD>
This command controls the grid in the editing area.  If the grid spacing
is below the value specified by gridTolerance resource (8 by default), 
the grid will be automatically turned off.  It can be enforced by explicitly
activating this command.
<DT><B>Dashed</B>

<DD>
This command controls the stipple for drawing the grid lines.  The stipple
specified by dashes resource can be turned on or off by activating this 
command.
<DT><B>Axes</B>

<DD>
This command controls the highlighting of the main axes of the image
being edited.  The actual lines are not part of the image.  They are
provided to aid user when constructing symmetrical images, or whenever
having the main axes highlighted helps your editing.
<DT><B>Stippled</B>

<DD>
This command controls the stippling of the highlighted areas of the
bitmap image.  The stipple specified by stipple resource can be turned on
or off by activating this command.
<DT><B>Proportional</B>

<DD>
This command controls the proportional mode.  If the proportional mode 
is on, width and height of all image squares are forced to be equal,
regardless of the proportions of the bitmap window.
<DT><B>Zoom</B>

<DD>
This command controls the zoom mode.  If there is a marked area of the 
image already displayed, bitmap will automatically zoom into it.  Otherwise,
user will have to highlight an area to be edited in the zoom mode and 
bitmap will automatically switch into it.  One can use all the editing
commands and other utilities in the zoom mode.  When you zoom out, undo
command will undo the whole zoom session.
<DT><B>Cut</B>

<DD>
This commands cuts the contents of the highlighted image area into the
internal cut and paste buffer.  
<DT><B>Copy</B>

<DD>
This command copies the contents of the highlighted image area into the
internal cut and paste buffer. 
<DT><B>Paste</B>

<DD>
This command will check if there are any other bitmap applications with
a highlighted image area, or if there is something in the internal cut
and paste buffer and copy it to the image.  To place the copied image,
click in the editing window and drag the outlined image to the position
where you want to place i, and then release the button.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CUT AND PASTE</H2>

Bitmap supports two cut and paste mechanisms; the internal cut and
paste and the global X selection cut and paste.  The internal cut and
paste is used when executing copy and move drawing commands and also
cut and copy commands from the edit menu.  The global X selection cut
and paste is used whenever there is a highlighted area of a bitmap
image displayed anywhere on the screen.  To copy a part of image from
another bitmap editor simply highlight the desired area by using the
Mark command or pressing the shift key and dragging the area with the
left mouse button.  When the selected area becomes highlighted, any
other applications (such as xterm, etc.) that use primary selection
will discard their selection values and unhighlight the appropriate
information.  Now, use the Paste command for the Edit menu or control
mouse button to copy the selected part of image into another (or the
same) bitmap application.  If you attempt to do this without a visible
highlighted image area, the bitmap will fall back to the internal cut
and paste buffer and paste whatever was there stored at the moment.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WIDGETS</H2>

Below is the widget structure of the <I>bitmap</I>
application.  Indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The
widget class name is given first, followed by the widget instance
name.  All widgets except the bitmap widget are from the standard
Athena widget set.

<H2>COLORS</H2>

If you would like bitmap to be viewable in color, include the following 
in the #ifdef COLOR section of the file you read with xrdb:
<P>
*customization:                 -color
<P>
<BR>

This will cause bitmap to pick up the colors in the app-defaults color
customization file:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/Bitmap-color

<H2>BITMAP WIDGET</H2>

Bitmap widget is a stand-alone widget for editing raster images.  It
is not designed to edit large images, although it may be used in that
purpose as well.  It can be freely incorporated with other
applications and used as a standard editing tool.  The following are
the resources provided by the bitmap widget.
