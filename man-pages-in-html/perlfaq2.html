perlfaq2 - Obtaining and Learning about Perl ($Revision: 1.25 $, $Date: 2003/10/16 04:57:38 $)
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
This section of the <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT> answers questions about where to find
source and documentation for Perl, support, and
related matters.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>What machines support Perl?  Where do I get it?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The standard release of Perl (the one maintained by the perl
development team) is distributed only in source code form.  You
can find this at <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz">http://www.cpan.org/src/latest.tar.gz</A> , which
is in a standard Internet format (a gzipped archive in <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> tar format).
<P>

Perl builds and runs on a bewildering number of platforms.  Virtually
all known and current Unix derivatives are supported (Perl's native
platform), as are other systems like <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">DOS</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">OS/2</FONT>, Windows,
<FONT SIZE="-1">QNX</FONT>, BeOS, <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X, MPE/iX and the Amiga.
<P>

Binary distributions for some proprietary platforms, including
Apple systems, can be found <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/ports/">http://www.cpan.org/ports/</A> directory.
Because these are not part of the standard distribution, they may
and in fact do differ from the base Perl port in a variety of ways.
You'll have to check their respective release notes to see just
what the differences are.  These differences can be either positive
(e.g. extensions for the features of the particular platform that
are not supported in the source release of perl) or negative (e.g.
might be based upon a less current source release of perl).
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I get a binary version of Perl?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
If you don't have a C compiler because your vendor for whatever
reasons did not include one with your system, the best thing to do is
grab a binary version of gcc from the net and use that to compile perl
with.  <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> only has binaries for systems that are terribly hard to
get free compilers for, not for Unix systems.
<P>

</PRE>


<P>

Someone looking for a Perl for Win16 might look to Laszlo Molnar's djgpp
port in <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos">http://www.cpan.org/ports/#msdos</A> , which comes with clear
installation instructions.  A simple installation guide for MS-DOS using
Ilya Zakharevich's <FONT SIZE="-1">OS/2</FONT> port is available at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.php">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perl5dos.html</A>
and similarly for Windows 3.1 at <A HREF="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.php">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/%7Epiet/perlwin3.html</A> .
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>I don't have a C compiler on my system.  How can I compile perl?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
Since you don't have a C compiler, you're doomed and your vendor
should be sacrificed to the Sun gods.  But that doesn't help you.
<P>

What you need to do is get a binary version of gcc for your system
first.  Consult the Usenet FAQs for your operating system for
information on where to get such a binary version.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>I copied the Perl binary from one machine to another, but scripts don't work.</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
That's probably because you forgot libraries, or library paths differ.
You really should build the whole distribution on the machine it will
eventually live on, and then type <TT>&quot;make install&quot;</TT>.  Most other
approaches are doomed to failure.
<P>

One simple way to check that things are in the right place is to print out
the hard-coded <TT>@INC</TT> that perl looks through for libraries:
<P>



<PRE>
    % perl -le 'print for @INC'

</PRE>


<P>

If this command lists any paths that don't exist on your system, then you
may need to move the appropriate libraries to these locations, or create
symbolic links, aliases, or shortcuts appropriately.  <TT>@INC</TT> is also printed as
part of the output of
<P>



<PRE>
    % perl -V

</PRE>


<P>

You might also want to check out
``How do I keep my own module/library directory?'' in perlfaq8.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>I grabbed the sources and tried to compile but gdbm/dynamic loading/malloc/linking/... failed.  How do I make it work?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Read the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>INSTALL</I></FONT><I></I> file, which is part of the source distribution.
It describes in detail how to cope with most idiosyncrasies that the
Configure script can't work around for any given system or
architecture.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>What modules and extensions are available for Perl?  What is <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>?  What does CPAN/src/... mean?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, a ~1.2Gb archive
replicated on nearly 200 machines all over the world.  <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> contains
source code, non-native ports, documentation, scripts, and many
third-party modules and extensions, designed for everything from
commercial database interfaces to keyboard/screen control to web
walking and <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> scripts.  The master web site for <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> is
<A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</A> and there is the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> Multiplexer at
<A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.php">http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html</A> which will choose a mirror near you
via <FONT SIZE="-1">DNS</FONT>.  See <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN">http://www.perl.com/CPAN</A> (without a slash at the
end) for how this process works. Also, <A HREF="http://mirror.cpan.org/">http://mirror.cpan.org/</A>
has a nice interface to the <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY">http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY</A>
mirror directory.
<P>

See the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT> at <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.php">http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html</A> for
answers to the most frequently asked questions about <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
including how to become a mirror.
<P>

CPAN/path/... is a naming convention for files available on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
sites.  <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> indicates the base directory of a <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> mirror, and the
rest of the path is the path from that directory to the file.  For
instance, if you're using <A HREF="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN</A>
as your <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> site, the file CPAN/misc/japh is downloadable as
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/misc/japh</A> .
<P>

Considering that there are close to two thousand existing modules in
the archive, one probably exists to do nearly anything you can think of.
Current categories under CPAN/modules/by-category/ include Perl core
modules; development support; operating system interfaces; networking,
devices, and interprocess communication; data type utilities; database
interfaces; user interfaces; interfaces to other languages; filenames,
file systems, and file locking; internationalization and locale; world
wide web support; server and daemon utilities; archiving and
compression; image manipulation; mail and news; control flow
utilities; filehandle and I/O; Microsoft Windows modules; and
miscellaneous modules.
<P>

See <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.php">http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html</A> or
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</A> for a more complete list of modules by category.
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> is not affiliated with O'Reilly and Associates.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Is there an <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT> certified version of Perl?

</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
Certainly not.  Larry expects that he'll be certified before Perl is.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Where can I get information on Perl?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
The complete Perl documentation is available with the Perl distribution.
If you have Perl installed locally, you probably have the documentation
installed as well: type <TT>&quot;man perl&quot;</TT> if you're on a system resembling Unix.
This will lead you to other important man pages, including how to set your
<TT>$MANPATH</TT>.  If you're not on a Unix system, access to the documentation
will be different; for example, documentation might only be in <FONT SIZE="-1">HTML</FONT> format.  All
proper Perl installations have fully-accessible documentation.
<P>

You might also try <TT>&quot;perldoc perl&quot;</TT> in case your system doesn't
have a proper man command, or it's been misinstalled.  If that doesn't
work, try looking in /usr/local/lib/perl5/pod for documentation.
<P>

If all else fails, consult <A HREF="http://perldoc.cpan.org/">http://perldoc.cpan.org/</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.perldoc.com/">http://www.perldoc.com/</A> both offer the complete documentation
in html format.
<P>

Many good books have been written about Perl---see the section below
for more details.
<P>

Tutorial documents are included in current or upcoming Perl releases
include perltoot for objects or perlboot for a beginner's
approach to objects, perlopentut for file opening semantics,
perlreftut for managing references, perlretut for regular
expressions, perlthrtut for threads, perldebtut for debugging,
and perlxstut for linking C and Perl together.  There may be more

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>What are the Perl newsgroups on Usenet?  Where do I post questions?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Several groups devoted to the Perl language are on Usenet:
<P>



<PRE>
    comp.lang.perl.announce             Moderated announcement group
    comp.lang.perl.misc                 High traffic general Perl discussion
    comp.lang.perl.moderated        Moderated discussion group
    comp.lang.perl.modules              Use and development of Perl modules
    comp.lang.perl.tk                   Using Tk (and X) from Perl

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    comp.infosystems.<A HREF="http://www.authoring.cgi">www.authoring.cgi</A>  Writing CGI scripts for the Web.

</PRE>


<P>

Some years ago, comp.lang.perl was divided into those groups, and
comp.lang.perl itself officially removed.  While that group may still
be found on some news servers, it is unwise to use it, because
postings there will not appear on news servers which honour the
official list of group names.  Use comp.lang.perl.misc for topics
which do not have a more-appropriate specific group.
<P>

There is also a Usenet gateway to Perl mailing lists sponsored by
perl.org at <A HREF="nntp://nntp.perl.org">nntp://nntp.perl.org</A> , a web interface to the same lists
at <A HREF="http://nntp.perl.org/group/">http://nntp.perl.org/group/</A> and these lists are also available
under the <TT>&quot;perl.*&quot;</TT> hierarchy at <A HREF="http://groups.google.com">http://groups.google.com</A> . Other
groups are listed at <A HREF="http://lists.perl.org/">http://lists.perl.org/</A> ( also known as
<A HREF="http://lists.cpan.org/">http://lists.cpan.org/</A> ).
<P>

A nice place to ask questions is the PerlMonks site, 
<A HREF="http://www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org/</A> , or the Perl Beginners mailing list
<A HREF="http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners">http://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=beginners</A> .
<P>

Note that none of the above are supposed to write your code for you:
asking questions about particular problems or general advice is fine,
but asking someone to write your code for free is not very cool.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Where should I post source code?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
You should post source code to whichever group is most appropriate, but
feel free to cross-post to comp.lang.perl.misc.  If you want to cross-post
to alt.sources, please make sure it follows their posting standards,
including setting the Followup-To header line to <FONT SIZE="-1">NOT</FONT> include alt.sources;
see their <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT> ( <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/alt-sources-intro/</A> ) for details.
<P>

If you're just looking for software, first use Google
( <A HREF="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</A> ), Google's usenet search interface
( <A HREF="http://groups.google.com">http://groups.google.com</A> ),  and <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> Search ( <A HREF="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</A> ).
This is faster and more productive than just posting a request.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Perl Books</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
A number of books on Perl and/or <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> programming are available.  A few of
these are good, some are <FONT SIZE="-1">OK</FONT>, but many aren't worth your money.  Tom
Christiansen maintains a list of these books, some with extensive
reviews, at <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/perl/critiques/index.php">http://www.perl.com/perl/critiques/index.html</A> .
<P>

The incontestably definitive reference book on Perl, written by

<H2>What mailing lists are there for Perl?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
Most of the major modules (Tk, <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT>, libwww-perl) have their own
mailing lists.  Consult the documentation that came with the module for
subscription information.

<H2>Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
In a real sense, Perl already <I>is</I> commercial software: it has a license
that you can grab and carefully read to your manager. It is distributed
in releases and comes in well-defined packages. There is a very large
user community and an extensive literature.  The comp.lang.perl.*
newsgroups and several of the mailing lists provide free answers to your
questions in near real-time.  Perl has traditionally been supported by
Larry, scores of software designers and developers, and myriad
programmers, all working for free to create a useful thing to make life
better for everyone.
<P>

However, these answers may not suffice for managers who require a
purchase order from a company whom they can sue should anything go awry.
Or maybe they need very serious hand-holding and contractual obligations.
Shrink-wrapped CDs with Perl on them are available from several sources if
that will help.  For example, many Perl books include a distribution of Perl,
as do the O'Reilly Perl Resource Kits (in both the Unix flavor
and in the proprietary Microsoft flavor); the free Unix distributions
also all come with Perl.
<P>

Alternatively, you can purchase commercial incidence based support
through the Perl Clinic.  The following is a commercial from them:
<P>

&quot;The Perl Clinic is a commercial Perl support service operated by
ActiveState Tool Corp. and The Ingram Group.  The operators have many
years of in-depth experience with Perl applications and Perl internals
on a wide range of platforms.
<P>

``Through our group of highly experienced and well-trained support engineers,
we will put our best effort into understanding your problem, providing an
explanation of the situation, and a recommendation on how to proceed.''

If you are reporting a bug in the perl interpreter or the modules
shipped with Perl, use the <I>perlbug</I> program in the Perl distribution or
mail your report to <A HREF="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</A> .
<P>

If you are posting a bug with a non-standard port (see the answer to
``What platforms is Perl available for?''), a binary distribution, or a
non-standard module (such as Tk, <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT>, etc), then please see the
documentation that came with it to determine the correct place to post
bugs.
