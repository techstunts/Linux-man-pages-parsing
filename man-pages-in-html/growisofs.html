<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>growisofs</B> was originally designed as a frontend to <B>mkisofs</B>
to facilitate appending of data to ISO9660 volumes residing on
random-access media such as DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, plain files, hard disk
partitions. In the course of development general purpose DVD recording
support was implemented, and as of now <B>growisofs</B> supports not
only random-access media, but even mastering of multi-session DVD media
such as DVD+R and DVD-R/-RW. In addition <B>growisofs</B> supports
first-/single-session recording of <I>arbitrary pre-mastered image</I>
(formatted as UDF, ISO9660 or any other file system, if formatted at
all) to all supported DVD media types.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-Z&nbsp;/dev/dvd</B>

<DD>
Burn an initial session to the selected device. A special form of this
option is recognized to support burning of pre-mastered images. See
EXAMPLES section for further details.
<DT><B>-M&nbsp;/dev/dvd</B>

<DD>
Merge a new session to an existing one.
<DT><B>-version</B>

<DD>
Print version information and invoke <B>mkisofs</B>, also with -version
option.
<DT><B>-dvd-compat</B>

<DD>
Provide maximum media compatibility with DVD-ROM/-Video. In write-once
context (DVD+R and DVD-R) this results in unappendable recording
(closed disk). In DVD+RW context it instructs the logical unit to
explicitly burn [otherwise optional] lead-out.
<DT><B>-dry-run</B>

<DD>
At dry-run <B>growisofs</B> performs all the steps till, but not
including the first write operation. Most notably check for &quot;overburn&quot;
condition is performed, which implies that mkisofs is invoked and
terminated prematurely.
<DT><B>-overburn</B>

<DD>
Normally DVD media can accommodate up to approximately 4.700.000.000
bytes (in marketing speech 4.7GB). In other words a DVD can contain
about 4.377 GiB or 4482 MiB. Growisofs won't start without this option,
if &quot;overburn&quot; condition appears to be unavoidable.
<DT><B>-speed=N</B>

<DD>
An option to control recording velocity. Most commonly you'll use
<B>-speed=1</B> with &quot;no-name&quot; DVD-R[W] media, if default speed
settings messes up the media. Keep in mind that <B>N</B> essentially
denotes speed <I>closest</I> to N*1385KBps among those offered by unit
for currently mounted media. The list can be found in
<B>dvd+rw-mediainfo</B> output.
<DT><B>&lt;mkisofs-options&gt;</B>

<DD>
More options can be found in the manpage for <B>mkisofs</B>.
<P>

There're several undocumented options commonly denoted with
<B>-use-the-force-luke</B> prefix. Some of them serve debugging
purposes. Some require certain knowledge about recording process or
even OS kernel internals and as being such can induce confusing
behaviour. Some are to be used in very specific situations better
recognized by front-ends or automated scripts. Rationale behind leaving
these options undocumented is that those few users who would actually
need to use them directly can as well consult the source code or obtain
specific instructions elsewhere.
<P>

<H2>DIFFERENCES WITH RUNNING MKISOFS DIRECTLY</H2>


When using growisofs you may not use the
<B>-o </B>

option for an output file.
<B>growisofs</B>

dumps the image directly to the media;

You don't have to specify the
<B>-C</B>

option to create a higher level session on a multi session disk,
<B>growisofs </B>

will construct one for you;

Otherwise everything that applies to 
<I>[multi-session] </I>

mastering with 
<B>mkisofs </B>

applies to 
<B>growisofs </B>

as well. 
<B>growisofs</B>

needs at least 
<B>mkisofs</B>

version 1.14, version 2.0 is required for multi-session write-once
recordings.
<P>

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

Actual device names vary from one operating system to another. We use
<I>/dev/dvd</I> as a collective name or as symbolic link to the actual
device if you wish. Under Linux it will most likely be an ide-scsi
device  such as &quot;/dev/scd0.&quot; Under NetBSD/OpenBSD it has to be a
<I>character</I> SCSI CD-ROM device such as &quot;/dev/rcd0c.&quot; Under Solaris
it also has to be a <I>character</I> SCSI/ATAPI CD-ROM device, e.g.
&quot;/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2&quot; or &quot;/vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0.&quot; And likewise in
HP-UX and IRIX...
<P>
To master and burn an ISO9660 volume with Joliet and Rock-Ridge
extensions on a DVD:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>growisofs <B>-Z</B> /dev/dvd <B>-R -J</B> /some/files<BR>
<P>
To append more data to same DVD:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>growisofs&nbsp;<B>-M</B>&nbsp;/dev/dvd&nbsp;<B>-R&nbsp;-J</B>&nbsp;/more/files<BR>
<P>
Make sure to use <I>the same options</I> for both inital burning and
following sessions.
<P>
To use <B>growisofs</B> to write a pre-mastered ISO-image to a DVD:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd<B>=</B>image.iso<BR>
<P>
where image.iso represents an arbitrary object in the filesystem, such
as file, named pipe or device entry. Nothing is growing here and
command name is not intuitive in this context.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

If executed under <A HREF="../man8/sudo.8.php">sudo</A>(8) growisofs refuses to start. This is done for
the following reason. Naturally growisofs has to access the data set to
be recorded to DVD media, either indirectly by letting mkisofs generate
ISO9660 layout on-the-fly or directly if a pre-mastered image is to be
recorded. Being executed under <A HREF="../man8/sudo.8.php">sudo</A>(8), growisofs effectively grants
sudoers read access to <I>any</I> file in the file system. The situation
is intensified by the fact that growisofs parses MKISOFS environment
variable in order to determine alternative path to mkisofs executable
image. This means that being executed under <A HREF="../man8/sudo.8.php">sudo</A>(8), growisofs
effectively grants sudoers right to execute program of their choice
with elevated privileges. If you for any reason still find the above
acceptable and are willing to take the consequences, then consider
running following wrapper script under <A HREF="../man8/sudo.8.php">sudo</A>(8) in place for real
growisofs binary.
<P>
<PRE>
        #!/bin/ksh
        unset SUDO_COMMAND
        export MKISOFS=/path/to/trusted/mkisofs
        exec growisofs &quot;$@&quot;
</PRE>

<P>
But note that the recommended alternative to the above &quot;workaround&quot; is
actually to install growisofs set-root-uid, in which case it will drop
privileges prior accessing data or executing mkisofs in order to
preclude unauthorized access to the data.
<P>
If the media already carries isofs and <B>growisofs</B> is invoked with
<B>-Z</B> option non-interactively, e.g. through cron, it shall fail
with &quot;FATAL: /dev/dvd already carries isofs!&quot; Note that only ISO9660 is
recognized, you can perfectly zap e.g. an UDF filesystem
non-interactively.
<P>
&quot;Overburn&quot; protection in pre-mastered image context works only with
plain files and ISO9660 formatted volumes. E.g. [given that /dev/root
is an ext2 formatted file system larger than 4.7GB] /dev/dvd=/dev/root is
bound to produce corrupted recording.
<P>
Note that DVD+RW re-formatting procedure does not substitute for
blanking. If you want to nullify the media, e.g. for privacy reasons,
do it explicitly with 'growisofs -Z /dev/dvd<B>=/dev/zero</B>'.
<P>
Playback of re-writable DVD media, both DVD+RW and DVD-RW, might be
limited in legacy DVD-ROM/-Video units. In most cases this is due
to lower reflectivity of such media.
<P>
Even though growisofs supports it, playback of multi-session write-once
DVD might be limited to the first session for two reasons:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
not all DVD-ROM players are capable of multi-border DVD-R playback,
even less are aware of DVD+R multi-sessioning, burner unit therefore
might be the only one in your vicinity capable of accessing files
written at different occasions;
<DT>*<DD>
OS might fail to mount multi-session DVD for various reasons;
</DL>
<P>

The above is not applicable to DVD+RW, DVD-RW Restricted Overwrite or
DVD-RAM, as volumes are grown within a single session.
