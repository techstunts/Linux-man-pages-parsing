parameter.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This manual page describes the GNU version of
<B>eqn</B>,

which is part of the groff document formatting system.
<B>eqn</B>

compiles descriptions of equations embedded within
<B>troff</B>

input files into commands that are understood by
<B>troff</B>.

Normally, it should be invoked using the
<B>-e</B>

option of
<B>groff</B>.

The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.
The output of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff;
it must be processed with GNU troff.
If no files are given on the command line, the standard input
will be read.
A filename of
<B>-</B>

will cause the standard input to be read.
<P>

<B>eqn</B>

searches for the file
<B>eqnrc</B>

in the directories given with the
<B>-M</B>

option first, then in
<B>/usr/lib/groff/site-tmac</B>,

<B>/usr/share/groff/site-tmac</B>,

and finally in the standard macro directory
<B>/usr/share/groff/1.18.1.1/tmac</B>.

If it exists, eqn will process it before the other input files.
The
<B>-R</B>

option prevents this.
<P>

GNU eqn does not provide the functionality of neqn:
it does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices
(although it may work adequately for very simple input).
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-d</B><I>xy</I>

<DD>
Specify delimiters
<I>x</I>

and
<I>y</I>

for the left and right end, respectively, of in-line equations.
Any
<B>delim</B>

statements in the source file overrides this.
<DT><B>-C</B>

<DD>
Recognize
<B>.EQ</B>

and
<B>.EN</B>

even when followed by a character other than space or newline.
<DT><B>-N</B>

<DD>
Don't allow newlines within delimiters.
This option allows
<B>eqn</B>

to recover better from missing closing delimiters.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Print the version number.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Only one size reduction.
<DT><B>-m</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
The minimum point-size is
<I>n</I>.

eqn will not reduce the size of subscripts or superscripts to
a smaller size than
<I>n</I>.

<DT><B>-T</B><I>name</I>

<DD>
The output is for device
<I>name</I>.

The only effect of this is to define a macro
<I>name</I>

with a value of
<B>1</B>.

Typically
<B>eqnrc</B>

will use this to provide definitions appropriate for the output device.
The default output device is
<B>ps</B>.

<DT><B>-M</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Search
<I>dir</I>

for
<B>eqnrc</B>

before the default directories.
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Don't load
<B>eqnrc</B>.

<DT><B>-f</B><I>F</I>

<DD>
This is equivalent to a
<B>gfont&nbsp;</B><I>F</I>

command.
<DT><B>-s</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
This is equivalent to a
<B>gsize&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

command.
This option is deprecated.
eqn will normally set equations at whatever the current point size
is when the equation is encountered.
<DT><B>-p</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
This says that subscripts and superscripts should be
<I>n</I>

points smaller than the surrounding text.
This option is deprecated. 
Normally eqn makes sets subscripts and superscripts at 70% 
of the size of the surrounding text.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USAGE</H2>

Only the differences between GNU eqn and Unix eqn are described here.
<P>

Most of the new features of GNU eqn
are based on TeX.
There are some references to the differences between TeX and GNU eqn below;
these may safely be ignored if you do not know TeX.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Automatic spacing</H3>

<P>

<B>eqn</B>

gives each component of an equation a type, and adjusts the spacing
between components using that type.
Possible types are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>ordinary<DD>
an ordinary character such as 1 or
<I>x</I>;

<DT>operator<DD>
a large operator such as


<FONT SIZE="+5">Sigma</FONT>;
<DT>binary<DD>
a binary operator such as +;
<DT>relation<DD>
a relation such as =;
<DT>opening<DD>
a opening bracket such as (;
<DT>closing<DD>
a closing bracket such as );
<DT>punctuation<DD>
a punctuation character such as ,;
<DT>inner<DD>
a subformula contained within brackets;
<DT>suppress<DD>
spacing that suppresses automatic spacing adjustment.
</DL>
<P>

Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>type&nbsp;</B><I>t&nbsp;e</I>

<DD>
This yields an equation component that contains
<I>e</I>

but that has type
<I>t</I>,

where
<I>t</I>

is one of the types mentioned above.
For example,
<B>times</B>

is defined as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>type &quot;binary&quot; \(mu</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but quoting protects
from macro expansion.
<DT><B>chartype&nbsp;</B><I>t&nbsp;text</I>

<DD>
Unquoted groups of characters are split up into individual characters,
and the type of each character is looked up;
this changes the type that is stored for each character;
it says that the characters in
<I>text</I>

from now on have type
<I>t</I>.

For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>chartype &quot;punctuation&quot; .,;:</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
would make the characters
<B>.,;:</B>

have type punctuation
whenever they subsequently appeared in an equation.
The type
<I>t</I>

can also be
<B>letter</B>

or
<B>digit</B>;

in these cases
<B>chartype</B>

changes the font type of the characters.
See the Fonts subsection.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>New primitives</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>e1&nbsp;</I><B>smallover&nbsp;</B><I>e2</I>

<DD>
This is similar to
<B>over</B>;

<B>smallover</B>

reduces the size of
<I>e1</I>

and
<I>e2</I>;

it also puts less vertical space between
<I>e1</I>

or
<I>e2</I>

and the fraction bar.
The
<B>over</B>

primitive corresponds to the TeX
<B>\over</B>

primitive in display styles;
<B>smallover</B>

corresponds to
<B>\over</B>

in non-display styles.
<DT><B>vcenter&nbsp;</B><I>e</I>

<DD>
This vertically centers
<I>e</I>

about the math axis.
The math axis is the vertical position about which characters
such as + and - are centered; also it is the vertical position
used for the bar of fractions.
For example,
<B>sum</B>

is defined as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>{ type &quot;operator&quot; vcenter size +5 \(*S }</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><I>e1&nbsp;</I><B>accent&nbsp;</B><I>e2</I>

<DD>
This sets
<I>e2</I>

as an accent over
<I>e1</I>.

<I>e2</I>

is assumed to be at the correct height for a lowercase letter;
<I>e2</I>

will be moved down according if
<I>e1</I>

is taller or shorter than a lowercase letter.
For example,
<B>hat</B>

is defined as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>accent { &quot;^&quot; }</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
<B>dotdot</B>,

<B>dot</B>,

<B>tilde</B>,

<B>vec</B>

and
<B>dyad</B>

are also defined using the
<B>accent</B>

primitive.
<DT><I>e1&nbsp;</I><B>uaccent&nbsp;</B><I>e2</I>

<DD>
This sets
<I>e2</I>

as an accent under
<I>e1</I>.

<I>e2</I>

is assumed to be at the correct height for a character without a descender;
<I>e2</I>

will be moved down if
<I>e1</I>

has a descender.
<B>utilde</B>

is pre-defined using
<B>uaccent</B>

as a tilde accent below the baseline.
<DT><B>split&nbsp;s</B><I>text</I><B>s</B>

<DD>
This has the same effect as simply
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<I>text</I>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
but
<I>text</I>

is not subject to macro expansion because it is quoted;
<I>text</I>

will be split up and the spacing between individual characters
will be adjusted.
<DT><B>nosplit&nbsp;</B><I>text</I>

<DD>
This has the same effect as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>s</B><I>text</I><B>s</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
but because
<I>text</I>

is not quoted it will be subject to macro expansion;
<I>text</I>

will not be split up
and the spacing between individual characters will not be adjusted.
<DT><I>e&nbsp;</I><B>opprime</B>

<DD>
This is a variant of
<B>prime</B>

that acts as an operator on
<I>e</I>.

It produces a different result from
<B>prime</B>

in a case such as
<B>A&nbsp;opprime&nbsp;sub&nbsp;1</B>:

with
<B>opprime</B>

the
<B>1</B>

will be tucked under the prime as a subscript to the
<B>A</B>

(as is conventional in mathematical typesetting),
whereas with
<B>prime</B>

the
<B>1</B>

will be a subscript to the prime character.
The precedence of
<B>opprime</B>

is the same as that of
<B>bar</B>

and
<B>under</B>,

which is higher than that of everything except
<B>accent</B>

and
<B>uaccent</B>.

In unquoted text a
<B>'</B>

that is not the first character will be treated like
<B>opprime</B>.

<DT><B>special&nbsp;</B><I>text&nbsp;e</I>

<DD>
This constructs a new object from
<I>e</I>

using a
<B><A HREF="../man1/troff.1.php">troff</A></B>(1)

macro named
<I>text</I>.

When the macro is called,
the string
<B>0s</B>

will contain the output for
<I>e</I>,

and the number registers
<B>0w</B>,

<B>0h</B>,

<B>0d</B>,

<B>0skern</B>

and
<B>0skew</B>

will contain the width, height, depth, subscript kern, and skew of
<I>e</I>.

(The
<I>subscript kern</I>

of an object says how much a subscript on that object should be tucked in;
the
<I>skew</I>

of an object says how far to the right of the center of the object an
accent over the object should be placed.)
The macro must modify
<B>0s</B>

so that it will output the desired result with its origin at the current
point, and increase the current horizontal position by the width
of the object.
The number registers must also be modified so that they correspond to the
result.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example, suppose you wanted a construct that `cancels' an expression
by drawing a diagonal line through it.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>.EQ
define cancel 'special Ca'
.EN
.de Ca
.ds 0s \Z'\\*(0s'\v'\\n(0du'\D'l \\n(0wu -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\v'\\n(0hu'
..
</B></PRE>

</DL>
<P>

Then you could cancel an expression
<I>e</I>

with
<B>cancel&nbsp;{&nbsp;</B><I>e&nbsp;</I><B>}</B>

<P>

Here's a more complicated construct that draws a box round an expression:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>.EQ
define box 'special Bx'
.EN
.de Bx
.ds 0s \Z'\h'1n'\\*(0s'\
\Z'\v'\\n(0du+1n'\D'l \\n(0wu+2n 0'\D'l 0 -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\
\D'l -\\n(0wu-2n 0'\D'l 0 \\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n''\h'\\n(0wu+2n'
.nr 0w +2n
.nr 0d +1n
.nr 0h +1n
..
</B></PRE>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Customization</H3>

The appearance of equations is controlled by
a large number of parameters. These can be set using
the
<B>set</B>

command.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>set&nbsp;</B><I>p&nbsp;n</I>

<DD>
This sets parameter
<I>p</I>

to value
<I>n ;</I>

<I>n</I>

is an integer.
For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>set x_height 45</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
says that
<B>eqn</B>

should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Possible parameters are as follows.
Values are in units of hundredths of an em unless otherwise stated.
These descriptions are intended to be expository rather than
definitive.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>minimum_size</B>

<DD>
<B>eqn</B>

will not set anything at a smaller point-size than this.
The value is in points.
<DT><B>fat_offset</B>

<DD>
The
<B>fat</B>

primitive emboldens an equation
by overprinting two copies of the equation
horizontally offset by this amount.
<DT><B>over_hang</B>

<DD>
A fraction bar will be longer by twice this amount than
the maximum of the widths of the numerator and denominator;
in other words, it will overhang the numerator and
denominator by at least this amount.
<DT><B>accent_width</B>

<DD>
When
<B>bar</B>

or
<B>under</B>

is applied to a single character,
the line will be this long.
Normally,
<B>bar</B>

or
<B>under</B>

produces a line whose length is the width of the object to which it applies;
in the case of a single character,
this tends to produce a line that looks too long.
<DT><B>delimiter_factor</B>

<DD>
Extensible delimiters produced with the
<B>left</B>

and
<B>right</B>

primitives will have a combined height and depth of at least this many
thousandths of twice the maximum amount by which the sub-equation that
the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis.
<DT><B>delimiter_shortfall</B>

<DD>
Extensible delimiters produced with the
<B>left</B>

and
<B>right</B>

primitives will have a combined height and depth
not less than the difference of
twice the maximum amount by which the sub-equation that
the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis
and this amount.
<DT><B>null_delimiter_space</B>

<DD>
This much horizontal space is inserted
on each side of a fraction.
<DT><B>script_space</B>

<DD>
The width of subscripts and superscripts is increased by this amount.
<DT><B>thin_space</B>

<DD>
This amount of space is automatically inserted after punctuation
characters.
<DT><B>medium_space</B>

<DD>
This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side
of binary operators.
<DT><B>thick_space</B>

<DD>
This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of
relations.
<DT><B>x_height</B>

<DD>
The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such as x.
<DT><B>axis_height</B>

<DD>
The height above the baseline of the center of characters
such as + and -.
It is important that this value is correct for the font
you are using.
<DT><B>default_rule_thickness</B>

<DD>
This should set to the thickness of the
<B>\(ru</B>

character, or the thickness of horizontal lines produced with the
<B>\D</B>

escape sequence.
<DT><B>num1</B>

<DD>
The
<B>over</B>

command will shift up the numerator by at least this amount.
<DT><B>num2</B>

<DD>
The
<B>smallover</B>

command will shift up the numerator by at least this amount.
<DT><B>denom1</B>

<DD>
The
<B>over</B>

command will shift down the denominator by at least this amount.
<DT><B>denom2</B>

<DD>
The
<B>smallover</B>

command will shift down the denominator by at least this amount.
<DT><B>sup1</B>

<DD>
Normally superscripts will be shifted up by at least this amount.
<DT><B>sup2</B>

<DD>
Superscripts within superscripts or upper limits
or numerators of
<B>smallover</B>

fractions
will be shifted up by at least this amount.
This is usually less than sup1.
<DT><B>sup3</B>

<DD>
Superscripts within denominators or square roots
or subscripts or lower limits will be shifted up by at least
this amount.
This is usually less than sup2.
<DT><B>sub1</B>

<DD>
Subscripts will normally be shifted down by at least this amount.
<DT><B>sub2</B>

<DD>
When there is both a subscript and a superscript, the subscript
will be shifted down by at least this amount.
<DT><B>sup_drop</B>

<DD>
The baseline of a superscript will be no more
than this much amount below the top of the object on
which the superscript is set.
<DT><B>sub_drop</B>

<DD>
The baseline of a subscript will be at least this much below
the bottom of the object on which the subscript is set.
<DT><B>big_op_spacing1</B>

<DD>
The baseline of an upper limit will be at least this
much above the top of the object on which the limit is set.
<DT><B>big_op_spacing2</B>

<DD>
The baseline of a lower limit will be at least this
much below the bottom of the object on which the limit is set.
<DT><B>big_op_spacing3</B>

<DD>
The bottom of an upper limit will be at least this much above the
top of the object on which the limit is set.
<DT><B>big_op_spacing4</B>

<DD>
The top of a lower limit will be at least this much below
the bottom of the object on which the limit is set.
<DT><B>big_op_spacing5</B>

<DD>
This much vertical space will be added above and below limits.
<DT><B>baseline_sep</B>

<DD>
The baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix will normally be
this far apart.
In most cases this should be equal to the sum of
<B>num1</B>

and
<B>denom1</B>.

<DT><B>shift_down</B>

<DD>
The midpoint between the top baseline and the bottom baseline
in a matrix or pile will be shifted down by this much from the axis.
In most cases this should be equal to
<B>axis_height</B>.

<DT><B>column_sep</B>

<DD>
This much space will be added between columns in a matrix.
<DT><B>matrix_side_sep</B>

<DD>
This much space will be added at each side of a matrix.
<DT><B>draw_lines</B>

<DD>
If this is non-zero, lines will be drawn using the
<B>\D</B>

escape sequence, rather than with the
<B>\l</B>

escape sequence and the
<B>\(ru</B>

character.
<DT><B>body_height</B>

<DD>
The amount by which the height of the equation exceeds this
will be added as extra space before the line containing the equation
(using
<B>\x</B>.)

The default value is 85.
<DT><B>body_depth</B>

<DD>
The amount by which the depth of the equation exceeds this
will be added as extra space after the line containing the equation
(using
<B>\x</B>.)

The default value is 35.
<DT><B>nroff</B>

<DD>
If this is non-zero,
then
<B>ndefine</B>

will behave like
<B>define</B>

and
<B>tdefine</B>

will be ignored,
otherwise
<B>tdefine</B>

will behave like
<B>define</B>

and
<B>ndefine</B>

will be ignored.
The default value is 0
(This is typically changed to 1 by the
<B>eqnrc</B>

file for the
<B>ascii</B>,

<B>latin1</B>,

<B>utf8</B>,

and
<B>cp1047</B>

devices.)

A more precise description of the role of many of these
parameters can be found in Appendix H of
<I>The&nbsp;TeXbook</I>.

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Macros</H3>

Macros can take arguments.
In a macro body,
<B>$</B><I>n</I>

where
<I>n</I>

is between 1 and 9,
will be replaced by the
<I>n-th</I>

argument if the macro is called with arguments;
if there are fewer than
<I>n</I>

arguments, it will be replaced by nothing.
A word containing a left parenthesis where the part of the word
before the left parenthesis has been defined using the
<B>define</B>

command
will be recognized as a macro call with arguments;
characters following the left parenthesis
up to a matching right parenthesis will be treated as comma-separated
arguments;
commas inside nested parentheses do not terminate an argument.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>sdefine&nbsp;</B><I>name&nbsp;X&nbsp;anything&nbsp;X</I>

<DD>
This is like the
<B>define</B>

command, but
<I>name</I>

will not be recognized if called with arguments.
<DT><B>include&nbsp;s</B><I>file</I><B>s</B>

<DD>
Include the contents of
<I>file</I>.

Lines of
<I>file</I>

beginning with
<B>.EQ</B>

or
<B>.EN</B>

will be ignored.
<DT><B>ifdef&nbsp;</B><I>name&nbsp;X&nbsp;anything&nbsp;X</I>

<DD>
If
<I>name</I>

has been defined by
<B>define</B>

(or has been automatically defined because
<I>name</I>

is the output device)
process
<I>anything</I>;

otherwise ignore
<I>anything</I>.

<I>X</I>

can be any character not appearing in
<I>anything</I>.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Fonts</H3>

<B>eqn</B>

normally uses at least two fonts to set an equation:
an italic font for letters,
and a roman font for everything else.
The existing
<B>gfont</B>

command
changes the font that is used as the italic font.
By default this is
<B>I</B>.

The font that is used as the roman font can be changed
using the new
<B>grfont</B>

command.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>grfont&nbsp;</B><I>f</I>

<DD>
Set the roman font to
<I>f</I>.

</DL>
<P>

The
<B>italic</B>

primitive uses the current italic font set by
<B>gfont</B>;

the
<B>roman</B>

primitive uses the current roman font set by
<B>grfont</B>.

There is also a new
<B>gbfont</B>

command, which changes the font used by the
<B>bold</B>

primitive.
If you only use the
<B>roman</B>,

<B>italic</B>
