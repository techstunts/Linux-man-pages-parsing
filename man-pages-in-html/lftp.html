<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSION</H2>

This man page documents lftp version 3.0.4.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>lftp</B> is a file transfer program that allows sophisticated ftp, http
and other connections to other hosts. If <I>site</I> is specified then lftp
will connect to that site otherwise a connection has to be established with
the open command.
<P>

<B>lftp</B> can handle seven file access methods - ftp, ftps, http, https,
hftp, fish, sftp and file (https and ftps are only available when lftp is
compiled with openssl library). You can specify the method to use in `open
URL' command, e.g. `open <A HREF="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux'.">http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux'.</A> hftp is
ftp-over-http-proxy protocol. It can be used automatically instead of ftp
if ftp:proxy is set to `<A HREF="http://proxy[:port]'.">http://proxy[:port]'.</A> Fish is a protocol working
over an ssh connection to a unix account. SFtp is a protocol implemented
in ssh2 as sftp subsystem.
<P>
<P>

Every operation in <B>lftp</B> is reliable, that is any not fatal error is
ignored and the operation is repeated. So if downloading breaks, it
will be restarted from the point automatically. Even if ftp server
does not support REST command, <B>lftp</B> will try to retrieve the file from
the very beginning until the file is transferred completely.
<P>
<B>lftp</B> has shell-like command syntax allowing you to launch several
commands in parallel in background (&amp;). It is also possible to group
commands within () and execute them in background. All background jobs
are executed in the same single process. You can bring a foreground
job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which
is alias to `wait'). To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some
commands allow redirecting their output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via
pipe to external command. Commands can be executed conditionally based
on termination status of previous command (&amp;&amp;, ||).
<P>

If you exit <B>lftp</B> when some jobs are not finished yet, <B>lftp</B> will move
itself to nohup mode in background. The same happens when you have a
real modem hangup or when you close an xterm.
<P>

<B>lftp</B> has builtin mirror which can download or update a whole directory
tree. There is also reverse mirror (mirror -R) which uploads or
updates a directory tree on server. Mirror can also synchronize directories
between two remote servers, using FXP if available.
<P>

There is command `at' to launch a job at specified time in current
context, command `queue' to queue commands for sequential execution
for current server, and much more.
<P>

On startup, <B>lftp</B> executes <I>/etc/l<A HREF="ftp://ftp.conf">ftp.conf</A></I> and then <I>~/.lftprc</I> and
<I>~/.lftp/rc</I>. You can place aliases and `set' commands there. Some
people prefer to see full protocol debug, use `debug' to turn the
debug on. Use `debug 3' to see only greeting messages and error
messages.
<P>

<B>lftp</B> has a number of settable variables. You can use `set -a' to see
all variables and their values or `set -d' to see list of defaults.
Variable names can be abbreviated and prefix can be omitted unless the
rest becomes ambiguous.
<P>

If lftp was compiled with ssl support, then it includes software developed
by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (<A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/)">http://www.openssl.org/)</A>

</PRE>



<P>

When using -R, the first directory is local and the second is remote.
If the second directory is omitted, base name of first directory is used.
If both directories are omitted, current local and remote directories are used.
<P>

<I>RX</I> is an extended regular expression, just like in
<B><A HREF="../man1/egrep.1.php">egrep</A></B>(1).

<P>

<I>GP</I> is a glob pattern, e.g. `*.zip'.
<P>

Include and exclude options can be specified multiple times. It means that
a file or directory would be mirrored if it matches an include and does
not match to excludes after the include, or does not match anything
and the first check is exclude. Directories are matched with a slash appended.
<P>

Note that when -R is used (reverse mirror), symbolic links are not created
on server, because ftp protocol cannot do it. To upload files the links refer
to, use `mirror -RL' command (treat symbolic links as files).
<P>

For option --newer-than you can either specify a file or time specification
like that used by <A HREF="../man1/at.1.php">at</A>(1) command, e.g. `now-7days' or `week ago'. If you
specify a file, then modification time of that file will be used.
<P>

Verbosity level can be selected using --verbose=level option or by several
-v options, e.g. -vvv. Levels are:


<P>


<PRE>
0 - no output (default)
1 - print actions
2 - +print not deleted file names (when -e is not specified)
3 - +print directory names which are mirrored

</PRE>



<P>

--only-newer turns off file size comparision and uploads/downloads
only newer files even if size is different. By default older files are transferred and replace newer ones.
<P>

You can mirror between two servers if you specify URLs instead of directories.
FXP is used automatically for transfers between ftp servers, if possible.
<P>
<B>mkdir</B>

[<B>-p</B>] <B></B><I>dir(s)</I>

<P>

Make remote directories. If -p is used, make all components of paths.
<P>
<B>module</B>

<I>module </I>[<I> args </I>]

<P>

Load given module using <A HREF="../man3/dlopen.3.php">dlopen</A>(3) function. If module name does not contain
a slash, it is searched in directories specified by module:path variable.
Arguments are passed to module_init function. See README.modules for technical
details.
<P>
<B>more</B>

<I>files</I>
<P>

Same as `cat <I>files</I> | more'. if <B>PAGER</B> is set, it is used as filter.
(See also <B>cat</B>, <B>zcat</B> and <B>zmore</B>)
<P>
<B>mput</B> [<B>-c</B>] [<B>-d</B>]

[<B>-a</B>] [<B>-E</B>]

[<B>-O</B> <I>base</I>] <I>files</I>

<P>

Upload files with wildcard expansion. By default it uses the base name of
local name as remote one. This can be changed by `-d' option.


<P>


<PRE>
-c              continue, reput
-d              create directories the same as in file names and put the
                files into them instead of current directory
-E              delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)
-a              use ascii mode (binary is the default)
-O &lt;base&gt;       specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

</PRE>



<P>
<B>mrm</B>

<I>file(s)</I>
<P>

Same as `glob rm'. Removes specified file(s) with wildcard expansion.
<P>
<B>mv</B>

<I>file1</I> <I>file2</I>
<P>

Rename <I>file1</I> to <I>file2</I>.
<P>
<B>nlist</B>

[<I>args</I>]
<P>

List remote file names
<P>
<B>open</B>

<P>
<B>pget</B>

[<I>OPTS</I>] <I>rfile</I> [<I></I><B>-o</B> lfile

]

<P>
Gets the specified file using several connections. This can speed up
transfer, but loads the net heavily impacting other users. Use only if
you really have to transfer the file ASAP, or some other user may go
mad :) Options:


<P>


<PRE>
-n      <I>maxconn</I>  set maximum number of connections (default 5)

</PRE>



<P>

<P>
<B>put</B> [<B>-E</B>]

[<B>-a</B>] [<B>-c</B>]

[<B>-O</B> <I>base</I>] <I>lfile</I> [<B>-o</B><I>rfile</I>]

<P>

Upload <I>lfile</I> with remote name <I>rfile</I>. If -o omitted, the base name
of <I>lfile</I> is used as remote name. Does not expand wildcards, use <B>mput</B> for that.


<P>


<PRE>
-o &lt;rfile&gt;      specifies remote file name (default - basename of lfile)
-c              continue, reput
                it requires permission to overwrite remote files
-E              delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)

-O &lt;base&gt;       specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

</PRE>



<P>
<B>pwd</B>

<P>

Print current remote directory.
<P>
<B>queue</B>

[<B>-n</B> <I>num</I> ] <I>cmd</I>

<P>

Add the given command to queue for sequential execution. Each site has its own
queue. `-n' adds the command before the given item in the queue. Don't try to
queue `cd' or `lcd' commands, it may confuse lftp. Instead
do the cd/lcd before `queue' command, and it will remember the place in which
the command is to be done. It is possible to queue up an already running job
by `queue wait &lt;jobno&gt;', but the job will continue execution even if it is not
the first in queue.
<P>

`queue stop' will stop the queue, it will not execute any new commands,
but already running jobs will continue to run. You can use `queue stop' to
create an empty stopped queue. `queue start' will resume queue execution.
When you exit lftp, it will start all stopped queues automatically.
<P>

`queue' with no arguments will either create a stopped queue or print queue
status.
<P>
<B>queue</B>

<B>--delete|-d </B>[<I>index or wildcard expression</I>]

<P>

Delete one or more items from the queue. If no argument is given, the last
entry in the queue is deleted.
<P>
<B>queue</B>

<B>--move|-m </B>&lt;<I>index or wildcard expression</I>&gt; [<I>index</I>]

<P>

Move the given items before the given queue index, or to the end if no
destination is given.
<P>



<P>


<PRE>
-q      Be quiet.
-v      Be verbose.
-Q      Output in a format that can be used to re-queue.
        Useful with --delete.

For FTP - send the command uninterpreted. Use with caution - it can lead to
unknown remote state and thus will cause reconnect. You cannot
be sure that any change of remote state because of quoted command
is solid - it can be reset by reconnect at any time.
<P>

For HTTP - specific to HTTP action. Syntax: ``quote &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]''.
Command may be ``set-cookie'' or ``post''.


<P>


<PRE>
open <A HREF="http://www.site.net">http://www.site.net</A>
quote set-cookie &quot;variable=value; othervar=othervalue&quot;
set http:post-content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
quote post /cgi-bin/script.cgi &quot;var=value&amp;othervar=othervalue&quot; &gt; local_file

</PRE>



<P>

For FISH - send the command uninterpreted. This can be used to execute
arbitrary commands on server. The command must not take input or print ###
at new line beginning. If it does, the protocol will become out of sync.

cd directory &amp;

</PRE>



<DT><B>dns:SRV-query</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>

are only used if port is not explicitly specified. See RFC2052 for details.
<DT><B>dns:cache-enable</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
enable DNS cache. If it is off, lftp resolves host name each time it reconnects.
<DT><B>dns:cache-expire</B> (time interval)

<DD>
time to live for DNS cache entries. It has format &lt;number&gt;&lt;unit&gt;+, e.g.
1d12h30m5s or just 36h. To disable expiration, set it to `inf' or `never'.
<DT><B>dns:cache-size</B>&nbsp;(number)

<DD>
maximum number of DNS cache entries.
<DT><B>dns:fatal-timeout</B>&nbsp;(seconds)

will fail to resolve a given host name. 0 means unlimited, the default.
<DT><B>dns:order</B> (list of protocol names)

<DD>
sets the order of DNS queries. Default is ``inet inet6'' which means first
look up address in inet family, then inet6 and use first matched.
<DT><B>dns:use-fork</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, lftp will fork before resolving host address. Default is true.
<DT><B>file:charset</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
local character set. It is set from current locale initially.
<DT><B>fish:connect-program</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
the program to use for connecting to remote server. It should support `-l' option
for user name, `-p' for port number. Default is `ssh -ax'. You can set it to
`rsh', for example.
<DT><B>fish:shell</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
use specified shell on server side. Default is /bin/sh. On some systems,
/bin/sh exits when doing cd to a non-existent directory. lftp can handle
that but it has to reconnect. Set it to /bin/bash for such systems if
bash is installed.
<DT><B>ftp:acct</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
Send this string in ACCT command after login. The result is ignored.
The closure for this setting has format <I><A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A></I>.
<DT><B>ftp:anon-pass</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
sets the password used for anonymous ftp access authentication.
Default is &quot;-name@&quot;, where name is the username of the user running the
program.
<DT><B>ftp:anon-user</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
sets the user name used for anonymous ftp access authentication.
Default is &quot;anonymous&quot;.
<DT><B>ftp:auto-sync-mode</B>&nbsp;(regex)

<DD>
if first server message metches this regex, turn on sync mode for that host.
<DT><B>ftp:charset</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
the character set used by ftp server in requests, replies and file listings.
Default is empty which means the same as local. This setting is only used
when the server does not support UTF8.
<DT><B>ftp:client</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
the name of ftp client to send with CLNT command, if supported by server.
If it is empty, then no CLNT command will be sent.
<DT><B>ftp:bind-data-socket</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
bind data socket to the interface of control connection (in passive mode).
Default is true, exception is the loopback interface.
<DT><B>ftp:fix-pasv-address</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, lftp will try to correct address returned by server for PASV command
in case when server address is in public network and PASV returns an address
from a private network. In this case lftp would substitute server address
instead of the one returned by PASV command, port number would not be changed.
Default is true.
<DT><B>ftp:fxp-passive-source</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, lftp will try to set up source ftp server in passive mode first,
otherwise destination one. If first attempt fails, lftp tries to set them up
the other way. If the other disposition fails too, lftp falls back to plain
copy. See also ftp:use-fxp.
<DT><B>ftp:home</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
Initial directory. Default is empty string which means auto. Set this to `/'
if you don't like the look of %2F in ftp URLs. The closure for this setting
has format <I><A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A></I>.
<DT><B>ftp:list-empty-ok</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if set to false, empty lists from LIST command will be treated as incorrect,
and another method (NLST) will be used.
<DT><B>ftp:list-options</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
sets options which are always appended to LIST command. It can be
useful to set this to `-a' if server does not show dot (hidden) files by default.
Default is empty.
<DT><B>ftp:nop-interval</B>&nbsp;(seconds)

<DD>
delay between NOOP commands when downloading tail of a file. This is useful
for ftp servers which send &quot;Transfer complete&quot; message before flushing
data transfer. In such cases NOOP commands can prevent connection timeout.
<DT><B>ftp:passive-mode</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
sets passive ftp mode. This can be useful if you are behind a firewall or a
dumb masquerading router. In passive mode lftp uses PASV command, not the
PORT command which is used in active mode. In passive mode lftp itself
makes the data connection to the server; in active mode the server connects
to lftp for data transfer. Passive mode is the default.
<DT><B>ftp:port-ipv4</B> (ipv4 address)

<DD>
specifies an IPv4 address to send with PORT command. Default is empty which
means to send the address of local end of control connection.
<DT><B>ftp:port-range</B>&nbsp;(from-to)

<DD>
allowed port range for active mode.
Format is min-max, or `full' or `any' to indicate any port. Default is `full'.
<DT><B>ftp:proxy</B>&nbsp;(URL)

<DD>
specifies ftp proxy to use.
To disable proxy set this to empty string. Note that it is an ftp proxy which
uses ftp protocol, not ftp over http. Default value is taken from environment
variable <B>ftp_proxy</B> if it starts with ``<A HREF="ftp://''.">ftp://''.</A> If your ftp proxy
requires authentication, specify user name and password in the URL.
</DL>
<P>

If ftp:proxy starts with <A HREF="http://,">http://,</A> hftp (ftp over http proxy) is used instead
of ftp automatically.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ftp:rest-list</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
allow usage of REST command before LIST command. This might be useful for
large directories, but some ftp servers silently ignore REST before LIST.
<DT><B>ftp:rest-stor</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if false, lftp will not try to use REST before STOR. This can be useful
for some buggy servers which corrupt (fill with zeros) the file if REST followed
by STOR is used.
<DT><B>ftp:retry-530</B>&nbsp;(regex)

<DD>
Retry on server reply 530 for PASS command if text matches this regular expression.
This setting should be useful to distinguish between overloaded server
(temporary condition) and incorrect password (permanent condition).
<DT><B>ftp:retry-530-anonymous</B>&nbsp;(regex)

<DD>
Additional regular expression for anonymous login, like ftp:retry-530.
<DT><B>ftp:site-group</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
Send this string in SITE GROUP command after login. The result is ignored.
The closure for this setting has format <I><A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A></I>.
<DT><B>ftp:skey-allow</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
allow sending skey/opie reply if server appears to support it. On by default.
<DT><B>ftp:skey-force</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
do not send plain text password over the network, use skey/opie instead. If
skey/opie is not available, assume failed login. Off by default.
<DT><B>ftp:ssl-allow</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, try to negotiate SSL connection with ftp server for non-anonymous
access. Default is true. This setting is only available if lftp was compiled
with openssl.
<DT><B>ftp:ssl-force</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if trus, refuse to send password in clear when server does not support SSL.
Default is false. This setting is only available if lftp was compiled with
openssl.
<DT><B>ftp:ssl-protect-data</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, request ssl connection for data transfers. This is cpu-intensive
but provides privacy. Default is false. This setting is only available if
lftp was compiled with openssl.
<DT><B>ftp:ssl-protect-fxp</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, request ssl connection for data transfer between two ftp servers
in FXP mode. CPSV or SSCN command will be used in that case. If ssl connection
fails for some reason, lftp would try unprotected FXP transfer unless
ftp:ssl-force is set for any of the two servers. Default is false.
<DT><B>ftp:ssl-protect-list</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, request ssl connection for file list transfers. Default is true.
<DT><B>ftp:stat-interval</B>&nbsp;(seconds)

<DD>
interval between STAT commands. Default is 1.
<DT><B>ftp:sync-mode</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, lftp will send one command at a time and wait for
response. This might be useful if you are using a buggy ftp server or
router. When it is off, lftp sends a pack of commands and waits for
responses - it speeds up operation when round trip time is significant.
Unfortunately it does not work with all ftp servers and some routers have
troubles with it, so it is on by default.
<DT><B>ftp:timezone</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
Assume this timezone for time in listings returned by LIST command.
This setting can be GMT offset [+|-]HH[:MM[:SS]] or any valid TZ value
(e.g. Europe/Moscow or MSK-3MSD,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3). The default is GMT.
Set it to an empty value to assume local timezone specified by environment
variable TZ.
<DT><B>ftp:use-abor</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if false, lftp does not send ABOR command but closes data connection
immediately.
<DT><B>ftp:use-feat</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when true (default), lftp uses FEAT command to determine extended features of
ftp server.
<DT><B>ftp:use-fxp</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, lftp will try to set up direct connection between two ftp servers.
<DT><B>ftp:use-hftp</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when ftp:proxy points to an http proxy, this setting selects hftp method (GET,
HEAD) when true, and CONNECT method when false. Default is true.
<DT><B>ftp:lang</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
the language selected with LANG command, if supported as indicated by FEAT
response. Default is empty which means server default.
<DT><B>ftp:use-mdtm</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when true (default), lftp uses MDTM command to determine file modification
time.
<DT><B>ftp:use-mdtm-overloaded</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when true, lftp uses two argument MDTM command to set file modification
time on uploaded files. Default is false.
<DT><B>ftp:use-site-idle</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when true, lftp sends `SITE IDLE' command with net:idle argument. Default
is false.
<DT><B>ftp:use-site-utime</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when true, lftp sends `SITE UTIME' command to set file modification time
on uploaded files. Default is true.
<DT><B>ftp:use-size</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when true (default), lftp uses SIZE command to determine file size.
<DT><B>ftp:use-stat</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, lftp sends STAT command in FXP mode transfer to know how much
data has been transferred. See also ftp:stat-interval. Default is true.
<DT><B>ftp:use-telnet-iac</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
when true (default), lftp uses TELNET IAC command and follows TELNET protocol
as specified in RFC959. When false, it does not follow TELNET protocol and
thus does not double 255 (0xFF, 0377) character and does not prefix ABOR and
STAT commands with TELNET IP+SYNCH signal.
<DT><B>ftp:use-quit</B> (bool)

<DD>
if true, lftp sends QUIT before disconnecting from ftp server. Default is true.
<DT><B>ftp:verify-address</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
verify that data connection comes from the network address of control
connection peer. This can possibly prevent data connection spoofing
which can lead to data corruption. Unfortunately, this can fail
for sertain ftp servers with several network interfaces,
when they do not set outgoing address on data socket, so it is disabled by default.
<DT><B>ftp:verify-port</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
verify that data connection has port 20 (ftp-data) on its remote end.
This can possibly prevent data connection spoofing by users of remote
host. Unfortunately, too many windows and even unix ftp servers forget
to set proper port on data connection, thus this check is off by default.
<DT><B>ftp:web-mode</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
disconnect after closing data connection. This can be useful for totally
broken ftp servers. Default is false.
<DT><B>hftp:cache</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
allow server/proxy side caching for ftp-over-http protocol.
<DT><B>hftp:proxy</B>&nbsp;(URL)

<DD>
specifies http proxy for ftp-over-http protocol (hftp). The protocol hftp
cannot work without a http proxy, obviously.
Default value is taken from environment
variable <B>ftp_proxy</B> if it starts with ``<A HREF="http://'',">http://'',</A> otherwise from
environment variable <B>http_proxy</B>.  If your ftp proxy
requires authentication, specify user name and password in the URL.
<DT><B>hftp:use-authorization</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if set to off, lftp will send password as part of URL to the proxy. This
may be required for some proxies (e.g. M-soft). Default is on, and lftp
will send password as part of Authorization header.
<DT><B>hftp:use-head</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if set to off, lftp will try to use `GET' instead of `HEAD' for hftp protocol.
While this is slower, it may allow lftp to work with some proxies which
don't understand or mishandle ``HEAD <A HREF="ftp://''">ftp://''</A> requests.
<DT><B>hftp:use-type</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
If set to off, lftp won't try to append `;type=' to URLs passed to proxy.
Some broken proxies don't handle it correctly. Default is on.
<DT><B>http:accept, http:accept-charset, http:accept-language</B> (string)

<DD>
specify corresponding HTTP request headers.
<DT><B>http:cache</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
allow server/proxy side caching.
<DT><B>http:cookie</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
send this cookie to server. A closure is useful here:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set&nbsp;cookie/<A HREF="http://www.somehost.com">www.somehost.com</A>&nbsp;&quot;param=value&quot;
<DT><B>http:post-content-type</B> (string)

<DD>
specifies value of Content-Type http request header for POST method.
Default is ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded''.
<DT><B>http:proxy</B>&nbsp;(URL)

<DD>
specifies http proxy. It is used when lftp works over http protocol.
Default value is taken from environment variable <B>http_proxy</B>.
If your proxy requires authentication, specify user name and password
in the URL.
<DT><B>http:put-method</B> (PUT or POST)

<DD>
specifies which http method to use on put.
<DT><B>http:put-content-type</B> (string)

<DD>
specifies value of Content-Type http request header for PUT method.
<DT><B>http:referer</B> (string)

<DD>
specifies value for Referer http request header. Single dot `.' expands
to current directory URL. Default is `.'. Set to empty string to disable
Referer header.
<DT><B>http:set-cookies</B> (boolean)

<DD>
if true, lftp modifies http:cookie variables when Set-Cookie header is received.
<DT><B>http:user-agent</B> (string)

<DD>
the string lftp sends in User-Agent header of HTTP request.
<DT><B>https:proxy</B> (string)

<DD>
specifies https proxy. Default value is taken from environment variable <B>https_proxy</B>.
<DT><B>mirror:exclude-regex</B> (regex)

<DD>
specifies default exclusion pattern. You can override it by --include option.
<DT><B>mirror:order</B> (list of patterns)

<DD>
specifies order of file transfers. E.g. setting this to &quot;*.sfv *.sum&quot; makes mirror to
transfer files matching *.sfv first, then ones matching *.sum and then all other
files. To process directories after other files, add &quot;*/&quot; to end of pattern list.
<DT><B>mirror:parallel-directories</B> (boolean)

<DD>
if true, mirror will start processing of several directories in parallel
when it is in parallel mode. Otherwise, it will transfer files from a single
directory before moving to other directories.
<DT><B>mirror:parallel-transfer-count</B> (number)

<DD>
specifies number of parallel transfers mirror is allowed to start. Default is 1.
You can override it with --parallel option.
<DT><B>mirror:use-pget-n</B> (number)

<DD>
specifies -n option for pget command used to transfer every single file under
mirror. Default is 1 which disables pget.
<DT><B>module:path</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
colon separated list of directories to look for modules. Can be initialized by
environment variable LFTP_MODULE_PATH. Default is `PKGLIBDIR/VERSION:PKGLIBDIR'.
<DT><B>net:connection-limit</B>&nbsp;(number)

<DD>
maximum number of concurrent connections to the same site. 0 means unlimited.
<DT><B>net:connection-takeover</B>&nbsp;(bool)

<DD>
if true, foreground connections have priority over background ones and can
interrupt background transfers to complete a foreground operation.
<DT><B>net:idle</B>&nbsp;(seconds)

<DD>
disconnect from server after that number of idle seconds.
<DT><B>net:limit-rate</B> (bytes per second)

limit transfer rate on data connection. 0 means unlimited. You can specify
two numbers separated by colon to limit download and upload rate separately.
<DT><B>net:limit-max</B>&nbsp;(bytes)

<DD>
limit accumulating of unused limit-rate. 0 means unlimited.
<DT><B>net:limit-total-rate</B> (bytes per second)

<DD>
limit transfer rate of all connections in sum. 0 means unlimited. You can specify
two numbers separated by colon to limit download and upload rate separately.
Note that sockets have receive buffers on them, this can lead to network
link load higher than this rate limit just after transfer beginning. You
can try to set net:socket-buffer to relatively small value to avoid this.
<DT><B>net:limit-total-max</B>&nbsp;(bytes)

<DD>
limit accumulating of unused limit-total-rate. 0 means unlimited.
<DT><B>net:max-retries</B>&nbsp;(number)

contains comma separated list of domains for which proxy should not be used.
Default is taken from environment variable <B>no_proxy</B>.
<DT><B>net:persist-retries</B> (number)

<DD>
ignore this number of hard errors. Useful to login to buggy ftp servers which
reply 5xx when there is too many users.
<DT><B>net:reconnect-interval-base</B>&nbsp;(seconds)

<DD>
sets the base minimal time between reconnects. Actual interval depends on
net:reconnect-interval-multiplier and number of attempts to perform an
operation.
<DT><B>net:reconnect-interval-max</B>&nbsp;(seconds)

<DD>
sets maximum reconnect interval. When current interval after multiplication
by net:reconnect-interval-multiplier reachs this value (or exceeds it), it
is reset back to net:reconnect-interval-base.
<DT><B>net:reconnect-interval-multiplier</B>&nbsp;(real&nbsp;number)

<DD>
sets multiplier by which base interval is multiplied each time new attempt
to perform an operation fails. When the interval reachs maximum, it is reset
to base value. See net:reconnect-interval-base and net:reconnect-interval-max.
<DT><B>net:socket-bind-ipv4</B> (ipv4 address)

<DD>
bind all IPv4 sockets to specified address. This can be useful to select a
specific network interface to use. Default is empty which means not to bind
IPv4 sockets, operating system will choose an address automatically using
routing table.
<DT><B>net:socket-bind-ipv6</B> (ipv6 address)

<DD>
the same for IPv6 sockets.
<DT><B>net:socket-buffer</B>&nbsp;(bytes)

`rsh', for example.
<DT><B>sftp:max-packets-in-flight</B>&nbsp;(number)

<DD>

significant, you should increase this and size-read/size-write. Default is 3.
<DT><B>sftp:protocol-version</B>&nbsp;(number)

<DD>
The protocol number to negotiate. Default is 4. The actual protocol version
used depends on server.
<DT><B>sftp:server-program</B>&nbsp;(string)

<DD>
The server program implementing SFTP protocol. If it does not contain a slash `/',
it is considered a ssh2 subsystem and -s option is used when starting connect-program.
Default is `sftp'. You can use rsh as transport level protocol like this:


<P>


<PRE>
set sftp:connect-program rsh
set sftp:server-program /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server

</PRE>



Similarly you can run sftp over ssh1.

<P>

The name of variables can be abbreviated unless it becomes
ambiguous. The prefix before `:' can be omitted too. You can
set one variable several times for different closures, and thus
you can get a particular settings for particular state. The closure
is to be specified after variable name separated with slash `/'.
<P>

The closure for `dns:', `net:', `ftp:', `http:', `hftp:' domain variables
is currently just the host name as you specify it in the `open' command
(with some exceptions where closure is meaningless, e.g. dns:cache-size).
For some `cmd:' domain variables the closure is current URL without path.
For other variables it is not currently used. See examples in the sample
<I>l<A HREF="ftp://ftp.conf">ftp.conf</A></I>.

<P>

Certain commands and settings take a time interval parameter. It has
the format Nx[Nx...], where N is time amount and x is time unit: d - days,
h - hours, m - minutes, s - seconds. Default unit is second. E.g. 5h30m.
Also the interval can be `infinity', `inf', `never', `forever' - it means
infinite interval. E.g. `sleep forever' or `set dns:cache-expire never'.

<H3>FTP asynchronous mode (pipelining)</H3>

<P>

<B>Lftp</B>

can speed up ftp operations by sending several commands at once and
then checking all the responses. See ftp:sync-mode variable. Sometimes
this does not work, thus synchronous mode is the default. You can try
to turn synchronous mode off and see if it works for you. It is known
that some network software dealing with address translation works
incorrectly in the case of several FTP commands in one network packet.
<P>

RFC959 says: ``The user-process sending another command before the
completion reply would be in violation of protocol; but server-FTP
processes should queue any commands that arrive while a preceding
command is in progress''. Also, RFC1123 says: ``Implementors MUST
NOT assume any correspondence between READ boundaries on the control
connection and the Telnet EOL sequences (CR LF).'' and ``a single READ
from the control connection may include more than one FTP command''.
<P>
So it must be safe to send several commands at once, which speeds up
operation a lot and seems to work with all Unix and VMS based ftp
servers. Unfortunately, windows based servers often cannot handle
several commands in one packet, and so cannot some broken routers.
