<H2>NAME</H2>

mpif77 - Compile LAM FORTRAN programs.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2>

mpif77 [-showme] ...
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-showme <DD>
Does not invoke the underlying FORTRAN compiler.  Instead, it shows
the command line that would be executed to compile the FORTRAN
program.
</DL>
<P>

See <A HREF="../man1/f77.1.php">f77</A>(1) (or whatever your underlying FORTRAN compiler is) for all
other options.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>mpif77</I>

is a convenience wrapper for the local native FORTRAN compiler.
Translation of a LAM program requires the linkage of the LAM essential
services libraries which may not reside in one of the standard search
directories of <A HREF="../man1/ld.1.php">ld</A>(1).
<I>mpif77</I>

passes its arguments along to the local native FORTRAN compiler along
with the -L and -l options required by LAM/MPI programs.  This
includes all necessary options for ROMIO and/or C++ bindings support
(if ROMIO/C++ support was included when LAM was compiled).
<P>

The LAM Team
<I>strongly</I>

encourages using
<I>mpif77</I>

instead of attempting to link to the LAM libraries manually.  This
allows the specific implementation of LAM to change without forcing
changes to linker directives in users' Makefiles (the specific set of
underlying LAM libraries has already changed multiple times, and will
likely change again in future versions).
<P>

Indeed, since
<I>mpif77</I>

is a very thin wrapper on top of an underlying compiler, there are no
compelling reasons
<I>not</I>

to use
<I>mpif77</I>.

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<P>

By default,
<I>hf77</I>

uses the FORTRAN compiler that was selected when LAM was configured
(with the --with-fc flag to ./configure) as the local native FORTRAN
compiler, but this can be overridden by the LAMHF77 environment
variable.
<P>

If the environment variable
<I>LAMHOME</I>

is set, 
<I>mpif77</I>

will use its value as the location of the LAM installation directory
instead of the value that was compiled into 
<I>mpif77</I>.

This means that
<I>mpif77</I>

will use the value of
<I>LAMHOME</I>

as the base to create the -I and -L arguments that are passed to the
lower-level compiler, not the installation directory that was supplied
when 
<I>mpif77</I>

was created.  This is almost always a Bad Idea.
<P>

The use of
<I>LAMHOME</I>

is discouraged except for some rare configuration cases in oddly
networked sites (in which case your system administrator should
probably set this up), and for advanced users with multiple LAM/MPI
installations who really know what they are doing; if the
<I>LAMHOME</I>

environment variable is unintentionally left set, it can lead to 
tremendous user confusion.  For example, if 
<I>LAMHOME </I>

points to LAM installation A, but the user's 
<I>PATH</I>

points to LAM installation B, then even though B's
<I>mpif77</I>

will be used, the user program will be compiled and linked against LAM
installation A.  
<P>

The 
<I>LAMHOME</I>

environment variable is mainly only left in place for backwards
compatibility; it is not required for normal functioning of LAM/MPI.
The LAM Team discourages the use of the
<I>LAMHOME</I>

environment variable, and instead advocates simply setting the
<I>PATH</I>

properly to switch between multiple LAM/MPI implementations.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Previous versions of 
<I>hf77</I>

did not automatically link in the MPI library.  Starting with LAM
version 6.3, since
<I>hf77</I>

has become the de facto LAM FORTRAN compiler, the
<I>-lmpi</I>

option is now automatically passed to the underlying compiler when
linking LAM/MPI programs.
<P>

Previous versions of LAM included the 
<I>mpif77</I>

wrapper script to automatically pass
<I>-lmpi</I>

to 
<I>hf77.</I>

This script is now obsolete since 
<I>hf77</I>

now includes
<I>-lmpi </I>

automatically.  
<I>mpif77</I>

is now a symbolic link to
<I>hf77</I>

to ensure backward compatibility.
