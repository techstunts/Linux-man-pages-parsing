<H2>NAME</H2>

smbtree - A text based smb network browser
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<B>smbtree</B> [-b] [-D] [-S]


<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<P>

<DD>This tool is part of the <B><A HREF="../man7/samba.7.php">samba</A></B>(7) suite.
<P>
<P>

<B>smbtree</B> is a smb browser program in text mode. It is similar to the &quot;Network Neighborhood&quot; found on Windows computers. It prints a tree with all the known domains, the servers in those domains and the shares on the servers.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-b<DD>
Query network nodes by sending requests as broadcasts instead of querying the local master browser.
<P>
<DT>-D<DD>
Only print a list of all the domains known on broadcast or by the master browser
<P>
<DT>-S<DD>
Only print a list of all the domains and servers responding on broadcast or known by the master browser.
<P>
<DT>-V<DD>
Prints the program version number.
<P>
<DT>-s &lt;configuration file&gt;<DD>
The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of all the services that the server is to provide. See <I>smb.conf</I> for more information. The default configuration file name is determined at compile time.
<P>
<DT>-d|--debug=debuglevel<DD>
<I>debuglevel</I> is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.
<P>
The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.
<P>
Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data, most of which is extremely cryptic.
<P>
Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log level parameter in the <I>smb.conf</I> file.
<P>
<DT>-l|--logfile=logdirectory<DD>
Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension <B>&quot;.progname&quot;</B> will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.
<P>
<DT>-N<DD>
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.
<P>
Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password.
<P>
<DT>-k<DD>
Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in an Active Directory environment.
<P>
<DT>-A|--authfile=filename<DD>
This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the connection. The format of the file is
<P>
<P>
<PRE>

username = &lt;value&gt;
password = &lt;value&gt;
domain   = &lt;value&gt;
</PRE>

<P>
<P>
Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users.
<P>
<DT>-U|--user=username[%password]<DD>
Sets the SMB username or username and password.
<P>
If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the <B>USER</B> environment variable, then the <B>LOGNAME</B> variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased. If these environmental variables are not found, the username <B>GUEST</B> is used.
<P>
A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password. This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the credentials on the command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the <I>-A</I> for more details.
<P>
Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on many systems the command line of a running process may be seen via the <B>ps</B> command. To be safe always allow <B>rpcclient</B> to prompt for a password and type it in directly.
<P>
<DT>-h|--help<DD>
Print a summary of command line options.
