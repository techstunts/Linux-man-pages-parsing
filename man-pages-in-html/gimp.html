<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

The <I>GIMP</I> is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is used to
edit and manipulate images. It can load and save a variety of image
formats and can be used to convert between formats.
<P>

GIMP can also be used as a paint program. It features a set of drawing
and painting tools such as airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint
brush. Painting and drawing tools can be applied to an image with a
variety of paint modes.  It also offers an extensive array of
selection tools like rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select, bezier select,
intelligent scissors, and select by color.
<P>

GIMP offers a variety of plugins that perform a variety of image
manipulations.  Examples include bumpmap, edge detect, gaussian blur,
and many others.
<P>

In addition, GIMP has several scripting extension which allow for
advanced non-interactive processing and creation of images.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>


The <I>gimp</I> accepts the following options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h, --help</B>

<DD>
Display a list of all commandline options.
<DT><B>-v, --version</B>

<DD>
Output the version info.
<DT><B>--verbose</B>

<DD>
Show startup messages.
<DT><B>--no-shm</B>

<DD>
Do not use shared memory between GIMP and its plugins. 
Instead of using shared memory, GIMP will send the data via pipe. This
will result in slower performance than using shared memory.
<DT><B>--no-cpu-accel</B>

<DD>
Do not use CPU accelerations such as MMX or SSE even if GIMP detects
that your CPU provides this functionality.
<DT><B>-d, --no-data</B>

<DD>
Do not load patterns, gradients, palettes, or brushes. Often useful
in non-interactive situations where startup time is to be minimized.
<DT><B>-f, --no-fonts</B>

<DD>
Do not load any fonts. No text functionality will be available if this
option is used.
<DT><B>-i, --no-interface</B>

<DD>
Run without a user interface.
<DT><B>--display </B><I>display</I>

<DD>
Use the designated X display.
<DT><B>-s, --no-splash</B>

<DD>
Do not show the splash screen.
<DT><B>--session </B><I>&lt;name&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use a different sessionrc for this GIMP session. The given session
name is appended to the default sessionrc filename.
<DT><B>-g, --gimprc </B><I>&lt;gimprc&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use an alternative gimprc instead of the default one. Useful in
cases where plugins paths or machine specs may be different.
<DT><B>--system-gimprc </B><I>&lt;gimprc&gt;</I>

<DD>
Use an alternate system gimprc file.
<DT><B>--dump-gimprc</B>

<DD>
Output a gimprc file with default settings.
<DT><B>--debug-handlers</B>

<DD>
Enable debugging signal handlers.
<DT><B>-c, --console-messages</B>

<DD>
Do not popup dialog boxes on errors or warnings. Print the messages on
the console instead.
<DT><B>--stack-trace-mode </B><I>{never|query|always}</I>

<DD>
If a stack-trace should be generated in case of fatal signals.
<DT><B>--pdb-compat-mode </B><I>{off|on|warn}</I>

<DT><B>-b, --batch </B><I>&lt;commands&gt;</I>

<DD>
Execute the set of <I>&lt;commands&gt;</I> non-interactively. The set
of <I>&lt;commands&gt;</I> is typically in the form of a script that
can be executed by one of the GIMP scripting extensions. When
<I>&lt;commands&gt;</I> is <B>-</B> the commands are read from standard
input.

<H2>FILES</H2>

<P>
GIMP's data files are stored in /usr/share/gimp/2.0, where ${prefix} 
is set on install, but is typically /usr/local. GIMP's system-wide
configuration files are stored in /etc/gimp/2.0.
Most GIMP configuration is read in from the user's init file,
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-2.0/gimprc. The system wide equivalent is in
/etc/gimprc. The system wide file is parsed 
first and the user gimprc can override the system settings. 
/etc/gimprc_user is the default gimprc
placed in users' home directories the first time GIMP is run.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-2.0/devicerc - holds settings for input devices
together with the tool, colors, brush, pattern and gradient 
associated to that device.
<P>
<B>$HOME</B>/.gimp-2.0/documents - lists all images that have been 
opened or saved using GIMP.
<P>

used.
<P>

<H2>SUGGESTIONS AND BUG REPORTS</H2>

Any bugs found should be reported to the online bug-tracking system
available on the web at <A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.">http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.</A> Before reporting
bugs, please check to see if the bug has already been reported.
<P>
When reporting GIMP bugs, it is important to include a reliable way to
reproduce the bug, version number of GIMP (and probably GTK), OS name
and version, and any relevant hardware specs. If a bug is causing a
crash, it is very useful if a stack trace can be provided. And of
course, patches to rectify the bug are even better.
