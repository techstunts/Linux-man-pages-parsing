<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<B>Mail</B>

is an intelligent mail processing system, which has
a command syntax reminiscent of
ed1


with lines replaced by messages.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>-v</B>


<DD>
Verbose mode.
The details of
delivery are displayed on the user's terminal.
<DT><B>-i</B>


<DD>
Ignore tty interrupt signals.
This is
particularly useful when using
<B>mail</B>

on noisy phone lines.
<DT><B>-I</B>


<DD>
Forces mail to run in interactive mode even when
input isn't a terminal.
In particular, the
`<B>~</B>

'

special
character when sending mail is only active in interactive mode.
<DT><B>-n</B>


<DD>
Inhibits reading
/etc/mail.rc

upon startup.
<DT><B>-N</B>


<DD>
Inhibits the initial display of message headers
when reading mail or editing a mail folder.
<DT><B>-s</B>


<DD>
Specify subject on command line
(only the first argument after the
-<B>s</B>

flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote subjects
containing spaces.)
<DT><B>-c</B>


<DD>
Send carbon copies to
<I>list</I>

of users.
<DT><B>-b</B>


<DD>
Send blind carbon copies to
<I>list</I>

 
List should be a comma-separated list of names.
<DT><B>-f</B>


<DD>
Read in the contents of your
<I>mbox</I>

(or the specified file)
for processing; when you
<I>quit </I>

 
<B>mail</B>

writes undeleted messages back to this file.
<DT><B>-u</B>


<DD>
Is equivalent to:

<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Sending mail</H3>

To send a message to one or more people,
<B>mail</B>

can be invoked with arguments which are the names of people to
whom the mail will be sent.
You are then expected to type in
your message, followed
by an
`<B>control-D</B>

'

at the beginning of a line.
The section below
<I>Replying to or originating mail</I>

 
describes some features of
<B>mail</B>

available to help you compose your letter.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Reading mail</H3>

In normal usage
<B>mail</B>

is given no arguments and checks your mail out of the
post office, then
prints out a one line header of each message found.
The current message is initially the first message (numbered 1)
and can be printed using the
<B>print</B>

command (which can be abbreviated
`<B>p</B>

'

) .
You can move among the messages much as you move between lines in
ed1,


with the commands
`<B>+</B>

'

and
`<B>-</B>

'

moving backwards and forwards, and
simple numbers.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Disposing of mail.</H3>

After examining a message you can
<B>delete</B>

`<B>d</B>

'

)
the message or
<B>reply</B>

`<B>r</B>

'

)
to it.
Deletion causes the
<B>mail</B>

program to forget about the message.
This is not irreversible; the message can be
<B>undeleted</B>

`<B>u</B>

'

)
by giving its number, or the
<B>mail</B>

session can be aborted by giving the
<B>exit</B>

`<B>x</B>

'

)
command.
Deleted messages will, however, usually disappear never to be seen again.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Specifying messages</H3>

Commands such as
<B>print</B>

and
<B>delete</B>

can be given a list of message numbers as arguments to apply
to a number of messages at once.
Thus
``<B>delete 1 2</B>

''

deletes messages 1 and 2, while
``<B>delete 1-5</B>

''

deletes messages 1 through 5.
The special name
`<B>*</B>

'

addresses all messages, and
`<B>$</B>

'

addresses
the last message; thus the command
<B>top</B>

which prints the first few lines of a message could be used in
``<B>top *</B>

''

to print the first few lines of all messages.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Replying to or originating mail.</H3>

You can use the
<B>reply</B>

command to
set up a response to a message, sending it back to the
person who it was from.
Text you then type in, up to an end-of-file,
defines the contents of the message.
While you are composing a message,
<B>mail</B>

treats lines beginning with the character
`<B>~</B>

'

specially.
For instance, typing
`<B>~m</B>

'

(alone on a line) will place a copy
of the current message into the response right shifting it by a tabstop
(see
<I>indentprefix</I>

variable, below).
Other escapes will set up subject fields, add and delete recipients
to the message and allow you to escape to an editor to revise the
message or to a shell to run some commands.
(These options
are given in the summary below.)
<P>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Ending a mail processing session.</H3>

You can end a
<B>mail</B>

session with the
<B>quit</B>

`<B>q</B>

'

)
command.
Messages which have been examined go to your
<I>mbox</I>

file unless they have been deleted in which case they are discarded.
Unexamined messages go back to the post office.
(See the
-<B>f</B>

option above).
<P>

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Personal and systemwide distribution lists.</H3>

It is also possible to create a personal distribution lists so that,
for instance, you can send mail to
``<B>cohorts</B>

''

and have it go
to a group of people.
Such lists can be defined by placing a line like
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>alias cohorts bill ozalp jkf mark <A HREF="mailto:kridle@ucbcory">kridle@ucbcory</A></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

in the file
.mailrc

in your home directory.
The current list of such aliases can be displayed with the
<B>alias</B>

command in
<B>mail </B>

 
System wide distribution lists can be created by editing
/etc/aliases

 
see
<A HREF="../man5/aliases.5.php">aliases</A>(5)


and
<A HREF="../man8/sendmail.8.php">sendmail</A>(8);


these are kept in a different syntax.
In mail you send, personal aliases will be expanded in mail sent
to others so that they will be able to
<B>reply</B>

to the recipients.
System wide
<B>aliases</B>

are not expanded when the mail is sent,
but any reply returned to the machine will have the system wide
alias expanded as all mail goes through
sendmail.


<P>

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Network mail (ARPA, UUCP, Berknet)</H3>

See
<A HREF="../man7/mailaddr.7.php">mailaddr</A>(7)


for a description of network addresses.
<P>

<B>Mail</B>

has a number of options which can be set in the
.mailrc

file to alter its behavior; thus
``<B>set askcc</B>

''

enables the
<I>askcc</I>

feature.
(These options are summarized below.)
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SUMMARY</H2>

(Adapted from the `Mail Reference Manual')
<P>

Each command is typed on a line by itself, and may take arguments
following the command word.
The command need not be typed in its
entirety - the first command which matches the typed prefix is used.
For commands which take message lists as arguments, if no message
list is given, then the next message forward which satisfies the
command's requirements is used.
If there are no messages forward of
the current message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there are no
good messages at all,
<B>mail</B>

types
``<B>applicable messages</B>



''

and
aborts the command.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>-</B>


<DD>
Print out the preceding message.
If given a numeric
argument
<I>n </I>

 
goes to the
<I>n </I><B>'th</B>



previous message and prints it.
<DT><B>?</B>


<DD>
Prints a brief summary of commands.
<DT><B>!</B>


<DD>
Executes the shell
(see
<A HREF="../man1/sh.1.php">sh</A>(1)


and
<A HREF="../man1/csh.1.php">csh</A>(1))


command which follows.
<DT><B>Print</B>


<DD>
(<B>P</B>

Like
<B>print</B>

but also prints out ignored header fields.
See also
<B>print</B>

 
<B>ignore</B>

and
<B>retain</B>

 
<DT><B>Reply</B>


<DD>
(<B>R</B>

)

Reply to originator.
Does not reply to other
recipients of the original message.
<DT><B>Type</B>

a new alias or changes an old one.
<DT><B>alternates</B>


<DD>
(<B>alt</B>

)

The
<B>alternates</B>

command is useful if you have accounts on several machines.
It can be used to inform
<B>mail</B>

that the listed addresses are really you.
When you
<B>reply</B>

to messages,
<B>mail</B>

will not send a copy of the message to any of the addresses
listed on the
<B>alternates</B>

list.
If the
<B>alternates</B>

command is given with no argument, the current set of alternate
names is displayed.
<DT><B>chdir</B>


<DD>
(<B>c</B>

)

Changes the user's working directory to that specified, if given.
If
no directory is given, then changes to the user's login directory.
<DT><B>copy</B>


<DD>

is used on for deletion when you quit.
<DT><B>delete</B>


<DD>
(<B>d</B>

)

Takes a list of messages as argument and marks them all as deleted.
Deleted messages will not be saved in

nor will they be available for most other commands.
<DT><B>dp</B>


<DD>
(also
<B>dt</B>

 
Deletes the current message and prints the next message.

the new file.
Some special conventions are recognized for
the name.
# means the previous file, % means your system
mailbox, %user means user's system mailbox, &amp; means
your
<I>mbox</I>

file, and
+folder means a file in your folder
directory.
<DT><B>from</B>


<DD>
(<B>f</B>

)

Takes a list of messages and prints their message headers.
<DT><B>headers</B>


<DD>
(<B>h</B>

)

Lists the current range of headers, which is an 18-message group.
If
a
`+'

argument is given, then the next 18-message group is printed, and if
a
`-'

argument is given, the previous 18-message group is printed.
<DT><B>help</B>

<B>hold</B>

or
<B>preserve</B>

or never referenced
in his system mailbox, and removing all other messages from his system
mailbox.
If new mail has arrived during the session, the message
``<B>You have new mail</B>

''

is given.
If given while editing a
mailbox file with the
-<B>f</B>

flag, then the edit file is rewritten.
A return to the Shell is

Here is a summary of the tilde escapes,
which are used when composing messages to perform
special functions.
Tilde escapes are only recognized at the beginning
of lines.

case the actual value is of interest.
The binary options include the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B></B><I>append</I>


<DD>
Causes messages saved in
<I>mbox</I>

to be appended to the end rather than prepended.
This should always be set (perhaps in
/etc/mail.rc )

 
<DT><B></B><I>ask, asksub</I>


<DD>
Causes
<B>mail</B>

to prompt you for the subject of each message you send.
If
you respond with simply a newline, no subject field will be sent.
<DT><B></B><I>askcc</I>


<DD>
Causes you to be prompted for additional carbon copy recipients at the
end of each message.
Responding with a newline indicates your
satisfaction with the current list.
<DT><B></B><I>askbcc</I>


<DD>
Causes you to be prompted for additional blind carbon copy recipients at the
end of each message.
Responding with a newline indicates your
satisfaction with the current list.
<DT><B></B><I>autoprint</I>


<DD>
Causes the
<B>delete</B>

command to behave like
<B>dp</B>

- thus, after deleting a message, the next one will be typed
automatically.
<DT><B></B><I>debug</I>


<DD>
Setting the binary option
<I>debug</I>

is the same as specifying
-<B>d</B>

on the command line and causes
<B>mail</B>

to output all sorts of information useful for debugging
<B>mail </B>

 
<DT><B></B><I>dot</I>


<DD>
The binary option
<I>dot</I>

causes
<B>mail</B>

to interpret a period alone on a line as the terminator
of a message you are sending.
<DT><B></B><I>hold</I>


<DD>
This option is used to hold messages in the system mailbox
by default.
<DT><B></B><I>ignore</I>


<DD>
Causes interrupt signals from your terminal to be ignored and echoed as
@'s.
<DT><B></B><I>ignoreeof</I>


<DD>
An option related to
<I>dot</I>

is
<I>ignoreeof</I>

which makes
<B>mail</B>

refuse to accept a control-d as the end of a message.
<I>Ignoreeof</I>

also applies to
<B>mail</B>

command mode.
<DT><B></B><I>metoo</I>


<DD>
Usually, when a group is expanded that contains the sender, the sender
is removed from the expansion.
Setting this option causes the sender
to be included in the group.
<DT><B></B><I>noheader</I>


<DD>
Setting the option
<I>noheader</I>

is the same as giving the
-<B>N</B>

flag on the command line.
<DT><B></B><I>nosave</I>


<DD>
Normally, when you abort a message with two
<B>RUBOUT</B>

(erase or delete)
<B>mail</B>

copies the partial letter to the file
``dead.letter

''

in your home directory.
Setting the binary option
<I>nosave</I>

prevents this.
<DT><B></B><I>Replyall</I>


<DD>
Reverses the sense of
<B>reply</B>

and
<B>Reply</B>

commands.
<DT><B></B><I>quiet</I>


<DD>
Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.
<DT><B></B><I>searchheaders</I>


<DD>
If this option is set, then a message-list specifier in the form ``/x:y''
will expand to all messages containing the substring ``y'' in the header
field ``x''.  The string search is case insensitive.
<DT><B></B><I>verbose</I>


<DD>
Setting the option
<I>verbose</I>

is the same as using the
-<B>v</B>

flag on the command line.
When mail runs in verbose mode,
the actual delivery of messages is displayed on the user's
terminal.

<B>visual</B>

command and
<B>~v</B>

escape.
<DT><B></B><I>crt</I>


<DD>
The valued option
<I>crt</I>

is used as a threshold to determine how long a message must
be before
<B>PAGER</B>

is used to read it.
If
<I>crt</I>

is set without a value,
then the height of the terminal screen stored in the system
is used to compute the threshold (see
<A HREF="../man1/stty.1.php">stty</A>(1)).


<DT><B></B><I>escape</I>


<DD>
If defined, the first character of this option gives the character to
