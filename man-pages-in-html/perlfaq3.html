<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
This section of the <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT> answers questions related to programmer tools
and programming support.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How do I do (anything)?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
Have you looked at <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> (see perlfaq2)?  The chances are that
someone has already written a module that can solve your problem.
Have you read the appropriate manpages?  Here's a brief index:
<P>



<PRE>

                        (not a man-page but still useful, a collection
                         of various essays on Perl techniques)

</PRE>


<P>

A crude table of contents for the Perl manpage set is found in perltoc.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I use Perl interactively?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
The typical approach uses the Perl debugger, described in the
<I><A HREF="../man1/perldebug.1.php">perldebug</A></I>(1) manpage, on an ``empty'' program, like this:
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -de 42

</PRE>


<P>

Now just type in any legal Perl code, and it will be immediately
evaluated.  You can also examine the symbol table, get stack
backtraces, check variable values, set breakpoints, and other
operations typically found in symbolic debuggers.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Is there a Perl shell?

</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
The psh (Perl sh) is currently at version 1.8. The Perl Shell is a
shell that combines the interactive nature of a Unix shell with the
power of Perl. The goal is a full featured shell that behaves as
expected for normal shell activity and uses Perl syntax and
functionality for control-flow statements and other things.
You can get psh at <A HREF="http://www.focusresearch.com/gregor/psh/">http://www.focusresearch.com/gregor/psh/</A> .
<P>

Zoidberg is a similar project and provides a shell written in perl,
configured in perl and operated in perl. It is intended as a login shell
and development environment. It can be found at <A HREF="http://zoidberg.sf.net/">http://zoidberg.sf.net/</A>
or your local <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> mirror.
<P>

The Shell.pm module (distributed with Perl) makes Perl try commands
which aren't part of the Perl language as shell commands.  perlsh
from the source distribution is simplistic and uninteresting, but
may still be what you want.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How do I find which modules are installed on my system?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
You can use the ExtUtils::Installed module to show all
installed distributions, although it can take awhile to do
its magic.  The standard library which comes with Perl just
shows up as ``Perl'' (although you can get those with
Module::CoreList).
<P>



<PRE>
        use ExtUtils::Installed;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
        my $inst    = ExtUtils::Installed-&gt;new();
        my @modules = $inst-&gt;modules();

</PRE>


<P>

If you want a list of all of the Perl module filenames, you
can use File::Find::Rule.
<P>



<PRE>
        use File::Find::Rule;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
        my @files = File::Find::Rule-&gt;file()-&gt;name( '*.pm' )-&gt;in( @INC );

</PRE>


<P>

If you do not have that module, you can do the same thing
with File::Find which is part of the standard library.
<P>



<PRE>
    use File::Find;
    my @files;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    find sub { push @files, $File::Find::name if -f _ &amp;&amp; /\.pm$/ },
         @INC;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
        print join &quot;\n&quot;, @files;

</PRE>


<P>

If you simply need to quickly check to see if a module is
available, you can check for its documentation.  If you can
read the documentation the module is most likely installed.
If you cannot read the documentation, the module might not
have any (in rare cases).
<P>



<PRE>
        prompt% perldoc Module::Name

</PRE>


<P>

You can also try to include the module in a one-liner to see if
perl finds it.
<P>



<PRE>
        perl -MModule::Name -e1

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How do I debug my Perl programs?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
Have you tried <TT>&quot;use warnings&quot;</TT> or used <TT>&quot;-w&quot;</TT>?  They enable warnings
to detect dubious practices.
<P>

Have you tried <TT>&quot;use strict&quot;</TT>?  It prevents you from using symbolic
references, makes you predeclare any subroutines that you call as bare
words, and (probably most importantly) forces you to predeclare your
variables with <TT>&quot;my&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;our&quot;</TT>, or <TT>&quot;use vars&quot;</TT>.
<P>

Did you check the return values of each and every system call?  The operating
system (and thus Perl) tells you whether they worked, and if not
why.
<P>



<PRE>
  open(FH, &quot;&gt; /etc/cantwrite&quot;)
    or die &quot;Couldn't write to /etc/cantwrite: $!\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>

Did you read perltrap?  It's full of gotchas for old and new Perl
programmers and even has sections for those of you who are upgrading
from languages like <I>awk</I> and <I>C</I>.
<P>

Have you tried the Perl debugger, described in perldebug?  You can
step through your program and see what it's doing and thus work out
why what it's doing isn't what it should be doing.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How do I profile my Perl programs?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
You should get the Devel::DProf module from the standard distribution
(or separately on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>) and also use Benchmark.pm from the standard
distribution.  The Benchmark module lets you time specific portions of
your code, while Devel::DProf gives detailed breakdowns of where your
code spends its time.
<P>

Here's a sample use of Benchmark:
<P>



<PRE>
  use Benchmark;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
  @junk = `cat /etc/motd`;
  $count = 10_000;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
  timethese($count, {
            'map' =&gt; sub { my @a = @junk;
                           map { s/a/b/ } @a;
                           return @a },
            'for' =&gt; sub { my @a = @junk;
                           for (@a) { s/a/b/ };
                           return @a },
           });

</PRE>


<P>

This is what it prints (on one machine---your results will be dependent
on your hardware, operating system, and the load on your machine):
<P>



<PRE>
  Benchmark: timing 10000 iterations of for, map...
         for:  4 secs ( 3.97 usr  0.01 sys =  3.98 cpu)
         map:  6 secs ( 4.97 usr  0.00 sys =  4.97 cpu)

</PRE>


<P>

Be aware that a good benchmark is very hard to write.  It only tests the
data you give it and proves little about the differing complexities
of contrasting algorithms.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How do I cross-reference my Perl programs?</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
The B::Xref module can be used to generate cross-reference reports
for Perl programs.
<P>



<PRE>
    perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] scriptname.plx

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Is there a pretty-printer (formatter) for Perl?

</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
Perltidy is a Perl script which indents and reformats Perl scripts
to make them easier to read by trying to follow the rules of the
perlstyle. If you write Perl scripts, or spend much time reading
them, you will probably find it useful.  It is available at
<A HREF="http://perltidy.sourceforge.net">http://perltidy.sourceforge.net</A>
<P>

Of course, if you simply follow the guidelines in perlstyle,
you shouldn't need to reformat.  The habit of formatting your code
as you write it will help prevent bugs.  Your editor can and should
help you with this.  The perl-mode or newer cperl-mode for emacs
can provide remarkable amounts of help with most (but not all)
code, and even less programmable editors can provide significant
assistance.  Tom Christiansen and many other <FONT SIZE="-1">VI</FONT> users  swear by
the following settings in vi and its clones:
<P>



<PRE>
    set ai sw=4
    map! ^O {^M}^[O^T

</PRE>


<P>

Put that in your <I>.exrc</I> file (replacing the caret characters
with control characters) and away you go.  In insert mode, ^T is
for indenting, ^D is for undenting, and ^O is for blockdenting---
as it were.  A more complete example, with comments, can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/toms.exrc.gz</A>
<P>

The a2ps <A HREF="http://www-inf.enst.fr/%7Edemaille/a2ps/black+white.ps.gz">http://www-inf.enst.fr/%7Edemaille/a2ps/black+white.ps.gz</A> does
lots of things related to generating nicely printed output of
documents, as does enscript at <A HREF="http://people.ssh.fi/mtr/genscript/">http://people.ssh.fi/mtr/genscript/</A> .
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Is there a ctags for Perl?

</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Recent versions of ctags do much more than older versions did.
<FONT SIZE="-1">EXUBERANT</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">CTAGS</FONT> is available from <A HREF="http://ctags.sourceforge.net/">http://ctags.sourceforge.net/</A>
and does a good job of making tags files for perl code.
<P>

There is also a simple one at
<A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/ptags.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/TOMC/scripts/ptags.gz</A> which may do
the trick.  It can be easy to hack this into what you want.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Is there an <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT> or Windows Perl Editor?

</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
Perl programs are just plain text, so any editor will do.
<P>

If you're on Unix, you already have an IDE---Unix itself.  The <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT>
philosophy is the philosophy of several small tools that each do one
thing and do it well.  It's like a carpenter's toolbox.
<P>

If you want an <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT>, check the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Komodo<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
ActiveState's cross-platform (as of April 2001 Windows and Linux),
multi-language <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT> has Perl support, including a regular expression
debugger and remote debugging
( <A HREF="http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo/index.php">http://www.ActiveState.com/Products/Komodo/index.html</A> ).  (Visual
Perl, a Visual Studio.NET plug-in is currently (early 2001) in beta

( <A HREF="http://www.castlelink.co.uk/object_system/">http://www.castlelink.co.uk/object_system/</A> ) is a Perl web
applications development <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT>, apparently for any platform
that runs Perl.
<DT>Open Perl <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT><DD>

environment, including debugger and syntax highlighting editor.
</DL>
<P>

For editors: if you're on Unix you probably have vi or a vi clone already,
and possibly an emacs too, so you may not need to download anything.
In any emacs the cperl-mode (M-x cperl-mode) gives you perhaps the
best available Perl editing mode in any editor.
<P>

If you are using Windows, you can use any editor that lets
you work with plain text, such as NotePad or WordPad.  Word
processors, such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, typically
do not work since they insert all sorts of behind-the-scenes
information, although some allow you to save files as ``Text
Only''. You can also download text editors designed
specifically for programming, such as Textpad
( <A HREF="http://www.textpad.com/">http://www.textpad.com/</A> ) and UltraEdit
( <A HREF="http://www.ultraedit.com/">http://www.ultraedit.com/</A> ), among others.
<P>

If you are using MacOS, the same concerns apply.  MacPerl
(for Classic environments) comes with a simple editor.
Popular external editors are BBEdit ( <A HREF="http://www.bbedit.com/">http://www.bbedit.com/</A> )
or Alpha ( <A HREF="http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/">http://www.kelehers.org/alpha/</A> ). MacOS X users can
use Unix editors as well.

</PRE>


<P>

nvi ( <A HREF="http://www.bostic.com/vi/">http://www.bostic.com/vi/</A> , available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> in src/misc/) is
yet another vi clone, unfortunately not available for Windows, but in
<FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> platforms you might be interested in trying it out, firstly because
strictly speaking it is not a vi clone, it is the real vi, or the new
incarnation of it, and secondly because you can embed Perl inside it
to use Perl as the scripting language.  nvi is not alone in this,
though: at least also vim and vile offer an embedded Perl.
<P>

The following are Win32 multilanguage editor/IDESs that support Perl:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Codewright<DD>
<A NAME="ixABA"></A>

</DL>
<P>

There is also a toyedit Text widget based editor written in Perl
that is distributed with the Tk module on <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.  The ptkdb
( <A HREF="http://world.std.com/~aep/ptkdb/">http://world.std.com/~aep/ptkdb/</A> ) is a Perl/tk based debugger that
acts as a development environment of sorts.  Perl Composer
( <A HREF="http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/">http://perlcomposer.sourceforge.net/</A> ) is an <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT> for Perl/Tk
<FONT SIZE="-1">GUI</FONT> creation.
<P>

In addition to an editor/IDE you might be interested in a more
powerful shell environment for Win32.  Your options include
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Bash<DD>
<A NAME="ixABD"></A>
from the Cygwin package ( <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</A> )
<DT>Ksh<DD>
<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
from the <FONT SIZE="-1">MKS</FONT> Toolkit ( <A HREF="http://www.mks.com/">http://www.mks.com/</A> ), or the Bourne shell of
the U/WIN environment ( <A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/">http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/</A> )
<DT>Tcsh<DD>

</DL>
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1">MKS</FONT> and U/WIN are commercial (U/WIN is free for educational and
research purposes), Cygwin is covered by the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> Public License (but
that shouldn't matter for Perl use).  The Cygwin, <FONT SIZE="-1">MKS</FONT>, and U/WIN all
contain (in addition to the shells) a comprehensive set of standard
<FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> toolkit utilities.
<P>

If you're transferring text files between Unix and Windows using <FONT SIZE="-1">FTP</FONT>
be sure to transfer them in <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> mode so the ends of lines are
appropriately converted.
<P>

On Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> the MacPerl Application comes with a simple 32k text editor
that behaves like a rudimentary <FONT SIZE="-1">IDE</FONT>.  In contrast to the MacPerl Application
the <FONT SIZE="-1">MPW</FONT> Perl tool can make use of the <FONT SIZE="-1">MPW</FONT> Shell itself as an editor (with
no 32k limit).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>BBEdit and BBEdit Lite<DD>
<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
are text editors for Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> that have a Perl sensitivity mode
( <A HREF="http://web.barebones.com/">http://web.barebones.com/</A> ).
<DT>Alpha<DD>
<A NAME="ixABI"></A>
is an editor, written and extensible in Tcl, that nonetheless has
built in support for several popular markup and programming languages
including Perl and <FONT SIZE="-1">HTML</FONT> ( <A HREF="http://alpha.olm.net/">http://alpha.olm.net/</A> ).
</DL>
<P>

Pepper and Pe are programming language sensitive text editors for Mac
<FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X and BeOS respectively ( <A HREF="http://www.hekkelman.com/">http://www.hekkelman.com/</A> ).
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Where can I get Perl macros for vi?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABJ"></A>
For a complete version of Tom Christiansen's vi configuration file,
see <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/toms.exrc.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/toms.exrc.gz</A> ,
the standard benchmark file for vi emulators.  The file runs best with nvi,
the current version of vi out of Berkeley, which incidentally can be built
with an embedded Perl interpreter---see <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/">http://www.cpan.org/src/misc/</A> .
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Where can I get perl-mode for emacs?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABK"></A>
Since Emacs version 19 patchlevel 22 or so, there have been both a
perl-mode.el and support for the Perl debugger built in.  These should
come with the standard Emacs 19 distribution.
<P>

In the Perl source directory, you'll find a directory called ``emacs'',
which contains a cperl-mode that color-codes keywords, provides
context-sensitive help, and other nifty things.
<P>

Note that the perl-mode of emacs will have fits with <TT>&quot;main'foo&quot;</TT>
(single quote), and mess up the indentation and highlighting.  You
are probably using <TT>&quot;main::foo&quot;</TT> in new Perl code anyway, so this
shouldn't be an issue.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I use curses with Perl?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABL"></A>
The Curses module from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> provides a dynamically loadable object
module interface to a curses library.  A small demo can be found at the
directory <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/rep.gz">http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/rep.gz</A> ;
this program repeats a command and updates the screen as needed, rendering
<B>rep ps axu</B> similar to <B>top</B>.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I use X or Tk with Perl?

</H2>

<A NAME="ixABM"></A>
Tk is a completely Perl-based, object-oriented interface to the Tk toolkit
that doesn't force you to use Tcl just to get at Tk.  Sx is an interface
to the Athena Widget set.  Both are available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.  See the
directory <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/08_User_Interfaces/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/08_User_Interfaces/</A>
<P>

Invaluable for Perl/Tk programming are the Perl/Tk <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT> at
<A HREF="http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/%7Epvhp/ptk/ptkTOC.php">http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/%7Epvhp/ptk/ptkTOC.html</A> , the Perl/Tk Reference
Guide available at

<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I make my Perl program run faster?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABO"></A>
The best way to do this is to come up with a better algorithm.  This
can often make a dramatic difference.  Jon Bentley's book
<I>Programming Pearls</I> (that's not a misspelling!)  has some good tips
on optimization, too.  Advice on benchmarking boils down to: benchmark
and profile to make sure you're optimizing the right part, look for
better algorithms instead of microtuning your code, and when all else
fails consider just buying faster hardware.  You will probably want to
read the answer to the earlier question ``How do I profile my Perl
programs?'' if you haven't done so already.
<P>

A different approach is to autoload seldom-used Perl code.  See the
AutoSplit and AutoLoader modules in the standard distribution for
that.  Or you could locate the bottleneck and think about writing just
that part in C, the way we used to take bottlenecks in C code and
write them in assembler.  Similar to rewriting in C, modules that have
critical sections can be written in C (for instance, the <FONT SIZE="-1">PDL</FONT> module
from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>).
<P>

If you're currently linking your perl executable to a shared
<I>libc.so</I>, you can often gain a 10-25% performance benefit by
rebuilding it to link with a static libc.a instead.  This will make a
bigger perl executable, but your Perl programs (and programmers) may
thank you for it.  See the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>INSTALL</I></FONT><I></I> file in the source distribution
for more information.
<P>

The undump program was an ancient attempt to speed up Perl program by
storing the already-compiled form to disk.  This is no longer a viable
option, as it only worked on a few architectures, and wasn't a good
solution anyway.
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I make my Perl program take less memory?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABP"></A>
When it comes to time-space tradeoffs, Perl nearly always prefers to
throw memory at a problem.  Scalars in Perl use more memory than
strings in C, arrays take more than that, and hashes use even more.  While
there's still a lot to be done, recent releases have been addressing
these issues.  For example, as of 5.004, duplicate hash keys are
shared amongst all hashes using them, so require no reallocation.
<P>

In some cases, using <I>substr()</I> or <I>vec()</I> to simulate arrays can be
highly beneficial.  For example, an array of a thousand booleans will
take at least 20,000 bytes of space, but it can be turned into one
125-byte bit vector---a considerable memory savings.  The standard
Tie::SubstrHash module can also help for certain types of data
structure.  If you're working with specialist data structures
(matrices, for instance) modules that implement these in C may use
less memory than equivalent Perl modules.
<P>

Another thing to try is learning whether your Perl was compiled with
the system malloc or with Perl's builtin malloc.  Whichever one it
is, try using the other one and see whether this makes a difference.
Information about malloc is in the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>INSTALL</I></FONT><I></I> file in the source
distribution.  You can find out whether you are using perl's malloc by
typing <TT>&quot;perl -V:usemymalloc&quot;</TT>.
<P>

Of course, the best way to save memory is to not do anything to waste
it in the first place. Good programming practices can go a long way
toward this:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>* Don't slurp!<DD>
<A NAME="ixABQ"></A>
Don't read an entire file into memory if you can process it line
by line. Or more concretely, use a loop like this:


<P>




<PRE>
        #
        # Good Idea
        #
        while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
           # ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


instead of this:


<P>




<PRE>
        #
        # Bad Idea
        #
        @data = &lt;FILE&gt;;
        foreach (@data) {
            # ...
        }

</PRE>




<P>


When the files you're processing are small, it doesn't much matter which
way you do it, but it makes a huge difference when they start getting
larger.
<DT>* Use map and grep selectively<DD>
<A NAME="ixABR"></A>
Remember that both map and grep expect a <FONT SIZE="-1">LIST</FONT> argument, so doing this:


<P>




<PRE>
        @wanted = grep {/pattern/} &lt;FILE&gt;;

</PRE>




<P>


will cause the entire file to be slurped. For large files, it's better
to loop:


<P>




<PRE>
        while (&lt;FILE&gt;) {
                push(@wanted, $_) if /pattern/;
        }

</PRE>


<DT>* Avoid unnecessary quotes and stringification<DD>
<A NAME="ixABS"></A>
Don't quote large strings unless absolutely necessary:


<P>




<PRE>
        my $copy = &quot;$large_string&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


makes 2 copies of <TT>$large_string</TT> (one for <TT>$copy</TT> and another for the
quotes), whereas


<P>




<PRE>
        my $copy = $large_string;

</PRE>




<P>


only makes one copy.


<P>


Ditto for stringifying large arrays:


<P>




<PRE>
        {
                local $, = &quot;\n&quot;;
                print @big_array;
        }

</PRE>




<P>


is much more memory-efficient than either


<P>




<PRE>
        print join &quot;\n&quot;, @big_array;

</PRE>




<P>


or


<P>




<PRE>
        {
                local $&quot; = &quot;\n&quot;;
                print &quot;@big_array&quot;;
        }

</PRE>


<DT>* Pass by reference<DD>
<A NAME="ixABT"></A>
Pass arrays and hashes by reference, not by value. For one thing, it's
the only way to pass multiple lists or hashes (or both) in a single
call/return. It also avoids creating a copy of all the contents. This
requires some judgment, however, because any changes will be propagated
back to the original data. If you really want to mangle (er, modify) a
copy, you'll have to sacrifice the memory needed to make one.
<DT>* Tie large variables to disk.<DD>
<A NAME="ixABU"></A>
For ``big'' data stores (i.e. ones that exceed available memory) consider
using one of the <FONT SIZE="-1">DB</FONT> modules to store it on disk instead of in <FONT SIZE="-1">RAM</FONT>. This
will incur a penalty in access time, but that's probably better than
causing your hard disk to thrash due to massive swapping.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Is it safe to return a reference to local or lexical data?

</H2>

<A NAME="ixABV"></A>
Yes. Perl's garbage collection system takes care of this so
everything works out right.
<P>



<PRE>
    sub makeone {
        my @a = ( 1 .. 10 );
        return \@a;
    }

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        push @many, makeone();
    }

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    print $many[4][5], &quot;\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    print &quot;@many\n&quot;;

</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I free an array or hash so my program shrinks?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABW"></A>
You usually can't. On most operating systems, memory
allocated to a program can never be returned to the system.
That's why long-running programs sometimes re-exec
themselves. Some operating systems (notably, systems that
use <I><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.php">mmap</A></I>(2) for allocating large chunks of memory) can
reclaim memory that is no longer used, but on such systems,
perl must be configured and compiled to use the <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT>'s malloc,
not perl's.
<P>

However, judicious use of <I>my()</I> on your variables will help make sure
that they go out of scope so that Perl can free up that space for
use in other parts of your program.  A global variable, of course, never
goes out of scope, so you can't get its space automatically reclaimed,
although <I>undef()</I>ing and/or <I>delete()</I>ing it will achieve the same effect.
In general, memory allocation and de-allocation isn't something you can
or should be worrying about much in Perl, but even this capability
(preallocation of data types) is in the works.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I make my <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> script more efficient?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABX"></A>
Beyond the normal measures described to make general Perl programs
faster or smaller, a <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> program has additional issues.  It may be run
several times per second.  Given that each time it runs it will need
to be re-compiled and will often allocate a megabyte or more of system
memory, this can be a killer.  Compiling into C <B>isn't going to help
you</B> because the process start-up overhead is where the bottleneck is.
<P>

There are two popular ways to avoid this overhead.  One solution
involves running the Apache <FONT SIZE="-1">HTTP</FONT> server (available from
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</A> ) with either of the mod_perl or mod_fastcgi
plugin modules.
<P>

With mod_perl and the Apache::Registry module (distributed with
mod_perl), httpd will run with an embedded Perl interpreter which
pre-compiles your script and then executes it within the same address
space without forking.  The Apache extension also gives Perl access to
the internal server <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT>, so modules written in Perl can do just about
anything a module written in C can.  For more on mod_perl, see
<A HREF="http://perl.apache.org/">http://perl.apache.org/</A>
<P>

With the <FONT SIZE="-1">FCGI</FONT> module (from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>) and the mod_fastcgi
module (available from <A HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/">http://www.fastcgi.com/</A> ) each of your Perl
programs becomes a permanent <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> daemon process.
<P>

Both of these solutions can have far-reaching effects on your system
and on the way you write your <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> programs, so investigate them with
care.
<P>

See <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/15_World_Wide_Web_HTML_HTTP_CGI/</A> .
<P>

A non-free, commercial product, ``The Velocity Engine for Perl'',
(<A HREF="http://www.binevolve.com/">http://www.binevolve.com/</A> or <A HREF="http://www.binevolve.com/velocigen/">http://www.binevolve.com/velocigen/</A> )
might also be worth looking at.  It will allow you to increase the
performance of your Perl programs, running programs up to 25 times
faster than normal <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> Perl when running in persistent Perl mode or 4
to 5 times faster without any modification to your existing <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT>
programs. Fully functional evaluation copies are available from the
web site.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I hide the source for my Perl program?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABY"></A>
Delete it. :-) Seriously, there are a number of (mostly
unsatisfactory) solutions with varying levels of ``security''.
<P>

First of all, however, you <I>can't</I> take away read permission, because
the source code has to be readable in order to be compiled and
interpreted.  (That doesn't mean that a <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT> script's source is
readable by people on the web, though---only by people with access to
the filesystem.)  So you have to leave the permissions at the socially
friendly 0755 level.
<P>

Some people regard this as a security problem.  If your program does
insecure things and relies on people not knowing how to exploit those
insecurities, it is not secure.  It is often possible for someone to
determine the insecure things and exploit them without viewing the
source.  Security through obscurity, the name for hiding your bugs
instead of fixing them, is little security indeed.
<P>

You can try using encryption via source filters (Starting from Perl
5.8 the Filter::Simple and Filter::Util::Call modules are included in
the standard distribution), but any decent programmer will be able to
decrypt it.  You can try using the byte code compiler and interpreter
described below, but the curious might still be able to de-compile it.
You can try using the native-code compiler described below, but
crackers might be able to disassemble it.  These pose varying degrees
of difficulty to people wanting to get at your code, but none can
definitively conceal it (true of every language, not just Perl).
<P>

It is very easy to recover the source of Perl programs.  You simply
feed the program to the perl interpreter and use the modules in
the B:: hierarchy.  The B::Deparse module should be able to
defeat most attempts to hide source.  Again, this is not
unique to Perl.
<P>

If you're concerned about people profiting from your code, then the
bottom line is that nothing but a restrictive license will give you
legal security.  License your software and pepper it with threatening
statements like ``This is unpublished proprietary software of <FONT SIZE="-1">XYZ</FONT> Corp.
Your access to it does not give you permission to use it blah blah
blah.''  We are not lawyers, of course, so you should see a lawyer if
you want to be sure your license's wording will stand up in court.
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How can I compile my Perl program into byte code or C?</H2>

<A NAME="ixABZ"></A>
Malcolm Beattie has written a multifunction backend compiler,
available from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, that can do both these things.  It is included
in the perl5.005 release, but is still considered experimental.
This means it's fun to play with if you're a programmer but not
really for people looking for turn-key solutions.
<P>

Merely compiling into C does not in and of itself guarantee that your
code will run very much faster.  That's because except for lucky cases
where a lot of native type inferencing is possible, the normal Perl
run-time system is still present and so your program will take just as
long to run and be just as big.  Most programs save little more than
compilation time, leaving execution no more than 10-30% faster.  A few
rare programs actually benefit significantly (even running several times
faster), but this takes some tweaking of your code.
<P>

You'll probably be astonished to learn that the current version of the
compiler generates a compiled form of your script whose executable is
just as big as the original perl executable, and then some.  That's
because as currently written, all programs are prepared for a full
<I>eval()</I> statement.  You can tremendously reduce this cost by building a
shared <I>libperl.so</I> library and linking against that.  See the
<I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>INSTALL</I></FONT><I></I> podfile in the Perl source distribution for details.  If
you link your main perl binary with this, it will make it minuscule.
For example, on one author's system, <I>/usr/bin/perl</I> is only 11k in
size!
<P>

In general, the compiler will do nothing to make a Perl program smaller,
faster, more portable, or more secure.  In fact, it can make your
situation worse.  The executable will be bigger, your <FONT SIZE="-1">VM</FONT> system may take
longer to load the whole thing, the binary is fragile and hard to fix,
and compilation never stopped software piracy in the form of crackers,
viruses, or bootleggers.  The real advantage of the compiler is merely
packaging, and once you see the size of what it makes (well, unless
you use a shared <I>libperl.so</I>), you'll probably want a complete
Perl install anyway.

<P>

The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState port of Perl,
will modify the Registry to associate the <TT>&quot;.pl&quot;</TT> extension with the
perl interpreter.  If you install another port, perhaps even building
your own Win95/NT Perl from the standard sources by using a Windows port
of gcc (e.g., with cygwin or mingw32), then you'll have to modify
the Registry yourself.  In addition to associating <TT>&quot;.pl&quot;</TT> with the
interpreter, <FONT SIZE="-1">NT</FONT> people can use: <TT>&quot;SET PATHEXT=%PATHEXT%;.PL&quot;</TT> to let them
run the program <TT>&quot;install-linux.pl&quot;</TT> merely by typing <TT>&quot;install-linux&quot;</TT>.

<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Why don't Perl one-liners work on my DOS/Mac/VMS system?</H2>

<A NAME="ixACD"></A>
The problem is usually that the command interpreters on those systems
have rather different ideas about quoting than the Unix shells under
which the one-liners were created.  On some systems, you may have to
change single-quotes to double ones, which you must <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>NOT</I></FONT><I></I> do on Unix
or Plan9 systems.  You might also have to change a single % to a %%.
<P>

For example:
<P>



<PRE>
    # Unix
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    # DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    # Mac
    print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;
     (then Run &quot;Myscript&quot; or Shift-Command-R)

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    # MPW
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'

</PRE>


<P>



<PRE>
    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;

</PRE>


<P>

The problem is that none of these examples are reliable: they depend on the
command interpreter.  Under Unix, the first two often work. Under <FONT SIZE="-1">DOS</FONT>,
it's entirely possible that neither works.  If 4DOS was the command shell,
you'd probably have better luck like this:
<P>



<PRE>
  perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;

</PRE>


<P>

Under the Mac, it depends which environment you are using.  The MacPerl
shell, or <FONT SIZE="-1">MPW</FONT>, is much like Unix shells in its support for several
quoting variants, except that it makes free use of the Mac's non-ASCII
characters as control characters.
<P>

Using <I>qq()</I>, q(), and <I>qx()</I>, instead of ``double quotes'', 'single
quotes', and `backticks`, may make one-liners easier to write.
<P>

There is no general solution to all of this.  It is a mess.
