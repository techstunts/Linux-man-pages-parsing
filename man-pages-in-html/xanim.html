</DL>
</DL>


<P>

<I>XAnim</I>

also provides various options that allow the user to alter colormaps, 
playback speeds, looping modes and can provide on-the-fly
scaling of animations with the mouse.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

A + will generally turn an option on and a - will turn an option off.
This can be reversed at compile time. (see 
<I>xanim_config.h</I>).

<P>

In each SubMenu, the options can be run together with no intervening
spaces. In the list of SubMenu options presented below, the first letter
given is the letter that specifies the SubMenu and should NOT be repeated 
if several SubMenu options are to be run together. 
<P>

For example, &quot;+Cn +Cs10 +CF4&quot; can also be written as &quot;+Cns10F4&quot; or &quot;+CF4s10n&quot;.
<P>

A + or a - within a SubMenu will be an exit from that submenu.
Options will affect all animations following the invocation of that
option. Some options may be changed in between animations without affecting
previous animations.
<P>

In the following sections, an
<I>num</I>

represents an integer number and an 
<I>fnum</I>

represents a floating point number. If a floating point number is of
an integer amount, the . need not be specified. There should be no
spaces between the option and the numbers.
<P>
<I>aopts</I>

SubMenu for Audio Options
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+AD</B><I>dev</I>

<DD>
AIX Only. Specify audio device. Default is /dev/paud0/1 . Another common
audio device is  /dev/acpa0/1 . For example: &quot;+AD/dev/acpa0/1&quot;.
<DT><B>+Ae</B>

<DD>
Audio Enable. XAnim will ignore audio data if this option is not used.
<DT><B>+Ak</B>

<DD>
This option allows XAnim to skip video frames in order to help 
keep video in sync with audio.  default is on.
<DT><B>+Am</B>

<DD>
Take the audio from the next audio-only file and use it with the 
video file previous to it.  Any audio already existing in that 
video file will be discarded. NOTE: XAnim by default will add
audio from an audio-only file to a previous video only(ie not audio)
file. This option just forces the issue if the previous file already
has audio.
<DT><B>+AM</B>

<DD>
Take the audio from the next audio-only file and use it with the 
video file previous to it. And in addition, scale the timing of 
that video file to be of the same duration of this audio file.
Any audio already existing in that video file will be discarded.
<DT><B>+Ap</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
This turns a hardware specific Audio port on or off. The default port is
selectable in xanim_config.h. It's shipped with internal speaker as default.
<DT><B>+As</B><I>fnum</I>

<DD>
Scale Audio playback speed by &quot;fnum&quot;. Only the range 0.125 to 8.00 is allowed.
NOTE: Video does not currently scale with the audio.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>+Av</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
Sets the inital Audio Volume(0-100) with 0 the lowest. default is 40.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

<I>copts</I>

SubMenu for Color Options
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+C1</B>

<DD>
Create a colormap from the first frame of a TrueColor anim and then
remap the remaining frames to this colormap. This can potentially add
significant time to the startup of an animation but usually results
in better colors. The animation needs to be buffered for this option
to work. Not valid for TrueColor or DirectColor displays(nor is it
needed).
<DT><B>+C3</B>

<DD>
Convert TrueColor anims to 332(StaticColor). TrueColor anims are
animations that provide separate RGB info for each pixel, rather
than each pixel being an index into a global colormap. AVI(16bit CRAM),
QT(RPZA and RLE depth 16 and 24) and URT RLE 24 bit anims are examples
of TrueColor anims. This option is ignored for TrueColor or DirectColor
displays.
<DT><B>+CA</B>

<DD>
Create a colormap from each frame of a TrueColor anim. This can be useful
if the colors radically change during the course of the animation. This
can take a VERY,VERY long time at start up. Animation must be buffered.
This option is ignored for TrueColor or DirectColor displays.
<DT><B>+Ca</B>

<DD>
Remap all images to single new cmap created from all of the colormaps.
<DT><B>+Cd</B>

<DD>
Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering if needed for non-monochrome displays.
This will cause a reduction in playback speed.
<DT><B>+Cf</B>

<DD>
Forcibly remap to all frames to 1st frame's cmap.
<DT><B>+CF0</B>

<DD>
Disables +CF4.
<DT><B>+CF4</B>

<DD>
This option samples the colors of true color
animations ahead of time and forms a color
lookup table.  Beats the just truncating to a
RGB 332 color table and IMHO beats dithering.
See the +s option below(also in copts submenu).
NOTE: this is now on by default.
<DT><B>+Cg</B>

<DD>
Convert TrueColor anims to gray scale. This option is ignored for
TrueColor and DirectColor displays.
<DT><B>+Ch</B>

<DD>
Use histogram to aid in color reduction. Histrogramming is only
done on frames that are buffered.
<DT><B>+Cm</B>

<DD>
This option is currently needed if you want to dither TrueColor anims
to a 332 colormap. Animation must be buffered. Typically +bC3dm is
the option to use. This can take a VERY long time at start up.
<DT><B>+Cn</B>

<DD>
Don't create new colormap but instead allocate colors from the X11
Display's default cmap.
<DT><B>+Cs</B><I>num</I>

<DD>
This is the number of frames the +CF4 option looks
at ahead of time. More frames potentially yields
better colors results, but takes more time at
start up.  default is 5.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUFFERING, PIXMAPS and READ_FROM_FILE Options</H2>

<P>

XAnim by default will read the entire animation into memory. PFX,
Moviesetter, GIF or URT RLE type animations are always uncompressed
and stored in memory as individual images. 
<P>

For the AVI, QT, IFF, FLI/FLC, JPEG, MPEG and DL animations, only the
compressed delta is stored. 
These deltas are then uncompressed each time they need to be
displayed. The buffer option(+b) may be used to potentially speed up
playback by uncompressing and storing these images ahead of time. But
more memory is used up in the process.
<P>

When an XPutImage is called, the image typically gets copied twice, once
to memory and then from there onto the display. A pixmap is directly
copied onto the display without the first copy. This is why it is 
sometimes much faster to use the pixmap option(+p).  Each image isn't
converted into a pixmap until the first time it is displayed. This is
why the first loop of an animation using this option is sometimes
slower than subsequent loops. While the pixmap option may improve
playback speed, it will slow things down if on-the-fly scaling needs
to be performed. This is because XAnim no longer has direct access
to the image and needs to get a copy of it before it can be scaled.
<P>

The read from file option(+f) causes XAnim not to store the compressed
deltas in memory. Instead as each image is to be displayed, XAnim reads
the corresponding compressed delta from the file, expands it and then
displays it. While this can dramatically cut down on memory usage, the
necessary reads from disk(or whatever) can slow down playback speed.
XAnim still needs to allocate one to three image buffers depending on
the type of animation and the scaling options used. This option is only
supported for AVI, QT, FLI/FLC, IFF, JPEG, MPEG and DL animations. The
BODY chunk of IFF animations is not included in this. As a result, an 
IFF animation that is made up of several BODY chunks will not currently 
benefit from this option.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SCALING Options</H2>

<P>

There are two sets of scaling options. One set, the display scaling
factors,  affects the size of the animation as it is displayed. The
other set, the buffer scaling factors, affect the size of the images
as they are stored in memory(buffered). The buffer scaling factors
only affect animations that are buffered and can greatly increase or
decrease memory usage.
<P>
These two sets are completely independent of each other. You can set
the buffer scaling factors to 20 times the normal animation size
and not affect the size at which that animation is displayed. The images
are stored at 20 times the normal size(and at 400 times the memory
usage), but then get scaled back down to normal size before being
displayed. NOTE: that an animation must be buffered in order for
the buffer scaling factors to have any affect on it. The display
scaling factors affect all animations.
<P>
You can create pixellation like affects by buffering the animation
at 1/8 it's normal size, but keeping the display scaling factors
at the original size. (IE &quot;xanim +bSS0.125 anim.anim&quot;).

Many times it's faster to store and display an animation with large
dimensions at half-size. The option &quot;+bSS0.5C&quot; or &quot;+bSS0.5s0.5&quot;
both will accomplish this. To save memory, you could even store
the animation at half size and yet display it at full size. &quot;+bSS0.5&quot;
will accomplish this.

<H2>FORWARDS, BACKWARDS and OPTIMIZATION.</H2>

<P>

Many type of animations(FLI/FLC/IFF/some AVI and QTs) are compressed
with forward playback in mind only. Each delta only stores the difference
between the current frame and the previous frame. As a results, most
of these animations don't display correctly when played backwards.
Even when buffered up, these may not work, since XAnim only stores
the smallest rectangle that encompasses the changes from the previous
frame. You can force XAnim to store the entire frame by specifying
the &quot;-o&quot; option to turn this optimization off. This will most likely
use more memory and slow down the animation, since more of the image
needs to be stored and/or displayed.

<H2>COLOR OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

Most of this will be a TBD for a future rev and what's here might be
sketchy, incomplete or just plain confusing.
<P>
TrueColor and DirectColor displays don't need to worry about most
of these options, as the animations can be displayed in their
original colors(ignoring monitor variations etc). However, TrueColor
and DirectColor displays can't display animations that employ color
cycling techniques where the colormap changes from frame to frame.
DirectColor could potentially support this, but not TrueColor.
<P>
For the rest of the displays, the problem becomes matching the
colors in the animations to the available colors of the Display.
For most PseudoColor displays this means 256 colors. Many of
which are already in use by various other programs. XAnim
defaults to creating it's own colormap and using all the colors
from that. The window manager then installs this new colormap,
whenever the mouse pointer is inside the XAnim animation
window(Sometimes a specific action is required
to change the ColorMap Focus, like clicking in the window or pressing
a specific key). In any case, this action usually causes all the other
colors on the screen to be temporarily &quot;messed-up&quot; until the mouse is
moved out of the animation window. The alternative, is to use
the &quot;+Cn&quot; option. Now XAnim tries allocating all the colors it needs
from the current colormap. If it can't get a certain color, then XAnim
choose one that is &quot;close&quot; to this certain color. Close is completely
arbitrary. The animation is now displayed in colors that are different
than the original colors. This difference may or may not be noticeable.
<P>
Another big problem is when the animations are what I called TrueColor
animations. Where each pixel is stored as RGB triplets. For example,
AVI 16 bit CRAM animations. Each pixel has 5 bits of Red, 5 bits of Green
and 5 bits of Blue info associated with it. This means there can be up to
32768 unique colors in each image. And on most PseudoColor displays we
can only display 256 unique colors. Beside getting better displays, what
can we do? XAnim defaults to truncating the RGB information from 555 to
332. That is to 3 bits of Red, 3 bits of Green and 2 bits of Blue. Less
on Blue because the human eye is more sensitive to Red and Green than Blue.
This 332 colormap happens to be 256 colors in size, which nicely fits in with
our display. If our display only had 64 colors, then XAnim is smart enough
to truncate things down to 222. Now the problem is the colors of the
displayed anim are noticeably different than the original colors.
Typically you can see color banding etc. While this is fine to get
a feel for the animation, we can do better. One of the solutions XAnim
currently offers is the &quot;+bC1&quot; option. What this does is choose the
the best 256 colors from the first image of the animation. Then each
pixel of each subsequent image is remapped to one of these 256 colors.
This takes up some CPU time up front and more memory since each image
needs to be buffered, but results in a colors that are
closer to the originals.  Another option, &quot;+bCA&quot;, chooses the best 256 from
each image, then 256 colors from all these colormaps are chosen as the
final colormap.  This is useful if the colors in the first image aren't
representative of the rest of the animation. This can be very slow. 
Another option that is
supported, but not really optimized for yet is &quot;+bC3dm&quot;. This causes
XAnim to use a 332 colormap and then apply a Floyd-Steinberg dither
algorithm to each image.  Currently this is very slow. Different
dithers(like Ordered) and better optimizations might speed this up in
future revs. In general, handling of TrueColor animations in XAnim
needs to be improved.
<P>
Another scenario where colors need to be remapped, is when several
images or animations with different colormaps need to be displayed.
Changing the colormap usually results in an annoying flicker. One
solution to this is to remap all of the images/animations to the
same colormap. The &quot;+Ca&quot; option chooses the best colors from all the
colormaps and then remaps all the images to it. The &quot;+Cf&quot; option,
simply remaps everything to the first colormap.
The &quot;+Ch&quot; option is useful when an animation's colormap
specifies a lot of colors that aren't used. XAnim looks through
each buffered image of the animation and makes a histogram of the
useage of each color. This information is then used to weedout
unused or rarely used colors.

<H2>QUICKTIME ANIMATIONS</H2>

<P>

Quicktime animations are usually stored in two separate files. One
is call a data fork and ends with a &quot;.data&quot;. The other is a resource
fork and ends in a &quot;.rsrc&quot;. Sometimes these animations are in a 
&quot;flattened/merged fork&quot; format, where everything is put into one file. 
There's no standard naming format for these types of files, although
usually .qt or .mov is used.
<P>
For example, if you have a quicktime animation made up of two files named:
&quot;spin.rsrc&quot; and &quot;spin.data&quot;,  you can display them using Xanim
with either of the following commands &quot;xanim spin&quot; or &quot;xanim spin.rsrc&quot;.
XAnim is smart enough to add/modfiy the &quot;.rsrc&quot; and &quot;.data&quot; endings as
needed.
<P>
If you use AUFS from the Columbia Appletalk Package, then Macintosh
files have their data fork stored in the expected place, and the
resource fork is in a file with the same name in a .resource
subdirectory. Therefore, if the data fork is in &quot;spin&quot;, and the resource
fork is in &quot;.resource/spin&quot;, the movie can be displayed with &quot;xanim spin&quot;.
<P>
For &quot;flattened/merged_fork&quot; quicktime animations, you need to specify 
the entire file name.
<P>
NOTE: XAnim doesn't support 100% of the quicktime format.
