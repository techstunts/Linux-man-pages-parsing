<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>



<PRE>
    Pflogsumm is a log analyzer/summarizer for the Postfix MTA.  It is
    designed to provide an over-view of Postfix activity, with just enough
    detail to give the administrator a &quot;heads up&quot; for potential trouble
    spots.
    
    Pflogsumm generates summaries and, in some cases, detailed reports of
    mail server traffic volumes, rejected and bounced email, and server
    warnings, errors and panics.


</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>



<PRE>
    -d today       generate report for just today
    -d yesterday   generate report for just &quot;yesterday&quot;


</PRE>




<PRE>
    -e             extended (extreme? excessive?) detail


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   Emit detailed reports.  At present, this includes
                   only a per-message report, sorted by sender domain,
                   then user-in-domain, then by queue i.d.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   WARNING: the data built to generate this report can
                   quickly consume very large amounts of memory if a
                   lot of log entries are processed!


</PRE>




<PRE>
    -h &lt;cnt&gt;       top &lt;cnt&gt; to display in host/domain reports.
    
                   0 = none.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   See also: &quot;-u&quot; and &quot;--no_*_detail&quot; for further
                             report-limiting options.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --help         Emit short usage message and bail out.
    
                   (By happy coincidence, &quot;-h&quot; alone does much the same,
                   being as it requires a numeric argument :-).  Yeah, I
                   know: lame.)


</PRE>




<PRE>
    -i
    --ignore_case  Handle complete email address in a case-insensitive
                   manner.
                   
                   Normally pflogsumm lower-cases only the host and
                   domain parts, leaving the user part alone.  This
                   option causes the entire email address to be lower-
                   cased.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --iso_date_time


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   For summaries that contain date or time information,
                   use ISO 8601 standard formats (CCYY-MM-DD and HH:MM),
                   rather than &quot;Mon DD CCYY&quot; and &quot;HHMM&quot;.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    -m             modify (mung?) UUCP-style bang-paths
    --uucp_mung


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   This is for use when you have a mix of Internet-style
                   domain addresses and UUCP-style bang-paths in the log.
                   Upstream UUCP feeds sometimes mung Internet domain
                   style address into bang-paths.  This option can
                   sometimes undo the &quot;damage&quot;.  For example:
                   &quot;somehost.dom!username@foo&quot; (where &quot;foo&quot; is the next
                   host upstream and &quot;somehost.dom&quot; was whence the email
                   originated) will get converted to
                   &quot;foo!<A HREF="mailto:username@somehost.dom">username@somehost.dom</A>&quot;.  This also affects the
                   extended detail report (-e), to help ensure that by-
                    domain-by-name sorting is more accurate.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --mailq        Run &quot;mailq&quot; command at end of report.
    
                   Merely a convenience feature.  (Assumes that &quot;mailq&quot;
                   is in $PATH.  See &quot;$mailqCmd&quot; variable to path thisi
                   if desired.)


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --no_bounce_detail
    --no_deferral_detail
    --no_reject_detail


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   Suppresses the printing of the following detailed
                   reports, respectively:


</PRE>




<PRE>
                        message bounce detail (by relay)
                        message deferral detail
                        message reject detail


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   See also: &quot;-u&quot; and &quot;-h&quot; for further report-limiting
                             options.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --no_no_msg_size


</PRE>




<PRE>
                    Do not emit report on &quot;Messages with no size data&quot;.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                    Message size is reported only by the queue manager.
                    The message may be delivered long-enough after the
                    (last) qmgr log entry that the information is not in
                    the log(s) processed by a particular run of
                    pflogsumm.pl.  This throws off &quot;Recipients by message
                    size&quot; and the total for &quot;bytes delivered.&quot; These are
                    normally reported by pflogsumm as &quot;Messages with no
                    size data.&quot;


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --no_smtpd_warnings


</PRE>




<PRE>
                    On a busy mail server, say at an ISP, SMTPD warnings
                    can result in a rather sizeable report.  This option
                    turns reporting them off.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --problems_first


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   Emit &quot;problems&quot; reports (bounces, defers, warnings,
                   etc.) before &quot;normal&quot; stats.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --rej_add_from
                   For those reject reports that list IP addresses or
                   host/domain names: append the email from address to
                   each listing.  (Does not apply to &quot;Improper use of
                   SMTP command pipelining&quot; report.)


</PRE>




<PRE>
    -q             quiet - don't print headings for empty reports
    
                   note: headings for warning, fatal, and &quot;master&quot;
                   messages will always be printed.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --smtpd_stats


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   Generate smtpd connection statistics.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   The &quot;per-day&quot; report is not generated for single-day
                   reports.  For multiple-day reports: &quot;per-hour&quot; numbers
                   are daily averages (reflected in the report heading).


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --syslog_name=name


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   Set syslog_name to look for for Postfix log entries.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   By default, pflogsumm looks for entries in logfiles
                   with a syslog name of &quot;postfix,&quot; the default.
                   If you've set a non-default &quot;syslog_name&quot; parameter
                   in your Postfix configuration, use this option to
                   tell pflogsumm what that is.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   See the discussion about the use of this option under
                   &quot;NOTES,&quot; below.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    -u &lt;cnt&gt;       top &lt;cnt&gt; to display in user reports. 0 == none.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   See also: &quot;-h&quot; and &quot;--no_*_detail&quot; for further
                             report-limiting options.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --verbose_msg_detail


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   For the message deferral, bounce and reject summaries:
                   display the full &quot;reason&quot;, rather than a truncated one.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   Note: this can result in quite long lines in the report.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --verp_mung    do &quot;VERP&quot; generated address (?) munging.  Convert
    --verp_mung=2  sender addresses of the form
                   &quot;list-return-NN-someuser=<A HREF="mailto:some.dom@host.sender.dom">some.dom@host.sender.dom</A>&quot;
                    to
                      &quot;list-return-ID-someuser=<A HREF="mailto:some.dom@host.sender.dom">some.dom@host.sender.dom</A>&quot;


</PRE>




<PRE>
                    In other words: replace the numeric value with &quot;ID&quot;.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   By specifying the optional &quot;=2&quot; (second form), the
                   munging is more &quot;aggressive&quot;, converting the address
                   to something like:


</PRE>




<PRE>
                        &quot;<A HREF="mailto:list-return@host.sender.dom">list-return@host.sender.dom</A>&quot;


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   Actually: specifying anything less than 2 does the
                   &quot;simple&quot; munging and anything greater than 1 results
                   in the more &quot;aggressive&quot; hack being applied.


</PRE>




<PRE>
                   See &quot;NOTES&quot; regarding this option.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --version      Print program name and version and bail out.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    --zero_fill    &quot;Zero-fill&quot; certain arrays so reports come out with

<PRE>
    Pflogsumm makes no attempt to catch/parse non-Postfix log
    entries.  Unless it has &quot;postfix/&quot; in the log entry, it will be
    ignored.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    It's important that the logs are presented to pflogsumm in
    chronological order so that message sizes are available when
    needed.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    For display purposes: integer values are munged into &quot;kilo&quot; and
    &quot;mega&quot; notation as they exceed certain values.  I chose the
    admittedly arbitrary boundaries of 512k and 512m as the points at
    which to do this--my thinking being 512x was the largest number
    (of digits) that most folks can comfortably grok at-a-glance.
    These are &quot;computer&quot; &quot;k&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, not 1000 and 1,000,000.  You
    can easily change all of this with some constants near the
    beginning of the program.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    &quot;Items-per-day&quot; reports are not generated for single-day
    reports.  For multiple-day reports: &quot;Items-per-hour&quot; numbers are
    daily averages (reflected in the report headings).


</PRE>




<PRE>
    Message rejects, reject warnings, holds and discards are all
    reported under the &quot;rejects&quot; column for the Per-Hour and Per-Day
    traffic summaries.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    Verp munging may not always result in correct address and
    address-count reduction.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    Verp munging is always in a state of experimentation.  The use
    of this option may result in inaccurate statistics with regards
    to the &quot;senders&quot; count.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    UUCP-style bang-path handling needs more work.  Particularly if
    Postfix is not being run with &quot;swap_bangpath = yes&quot; and/or *is* being
    run with &quot;append_dot_mydomain = yes&quot;, the detailed by-message report
    may not be sorted correctly by-domain-by-user.  (Also depends on
    upstream MTA, I suspect.)


</PRE>




<PRE>
    The &quot;percent rejected&quot; and &quot;percent discarded&quot; figures are only
    approximations.  They are calculated as follows (example is for
    &quot;percent rejected&quot;):


</PRE>




<PRE>
        percent rejected =
        
            (rejected / (delivered + rejected + discarded)) * 100


</PRE>




<PRE>
    There are some issues with the use of --syslog_name.  The problem is
    that, even with $syslog_name set, Postfix will sometimes still log
    things with &quot;postfix&quot; as the syslog_name.  This is noted in
    /etc/postfix/sample-misc.cf:


</PRE>




<PRE>
        # Beware: a non-default syslog_name setting takes effect only
        # after process initialization. Some initialization errors will be
        # logged with the default name, especially errors while parsing
        # the command line and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
        # configuration file.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    As a consequence, pflogsumm must always look for &quot;postfix,&quot; in logs,
    as well as whatever is supplied for syslog_name.


</PRE>




<PRE>
    Where this becomes an issue is where people are running two or more
    instances of Postfix, logging to the same file.  In such a case:


</PRE>




<PRE>
        . Neither instance may use the default &quot;postfix&quot; syslog name
          and...


</PRE>




<PRE>
        . Log entries that fall victim to what's described in
          sample-misc.cf will be reported under &quot;postfix&quot;, so that if
          you're running pflogsumm twice, once for each syslog_name, such
          log entries will show up in each report.
