<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

<B>djpeg</B>

decompresses the named JPEG file, or the standard input if no file is named,
and produces an image file on the standard output.  PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM), BMP,
GIF, Targa, or RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit) output format can be selected.
(RLE is supported only if the URT library is available.)
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

All switch names may be abbreviated; for example,
<B>-grayscale</B>

may be written
<B>-gray</B>

or
<B>-gr</B>.

Most of the &quot;basic&quot; switches can be abbreviated to as little as one letter.
Upper and lower case are equivalent (thus
<B>-BMP</B>

is the same as
<B>-bmp</B>).

British spellings are also accepted (e.g.,
<B>-greyscale</B>),

though for brevity these are not mentioned below.
<P>

The basic switches are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-colors</B><I> N</I>

<DD>
Reduce image to at most N colors.  This reduces the number of colors used in
the output image, so that it can be displayed on a colormapped display or
stored in a colormapped file format.  For example, if you have an 8-bit
display, you'd need to reduce to 256 or fewer colors.
<DT><B>-quantize</B><I> N</I>

<DD>
Same as
<B>-colors</B>.

<B>-colors</B>

is the recommended name,
<B>-quantize</B>

is provided only for backwards compatibility.
<DT><B>-fast</B>

<DD>
Select recommended processing options for fast, low quality output.  (The
default options are chosen for highest quality output.)  Currently, this is
equivalent to <B>-dct fast -nosmooth -onepass -dither ordered</B>.
<DT><B>-grayscale</B>

<DD>
Force gray-scale output even if JPEG file is color.  Useful for viewing on
monochrome displays; also,
<B>djpeg</B>

runs noticeably faster in this mode.
<DT><B>-scale</B><I> M/N</I>

<DD>
Scale the output image by a factor M/N.  Currently the scale factor must be
1/1, 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8.  Scaling is handy if the image is larger than your
screen; also,
<B>djpeg</B>

runs much faster when scaling down the output.
<DT><B>-bmp</B>

<DD>
Select BMP output format (Windows flavor).  8-bit colormapped format is
emitted if
<B>-colors</B>

or
<B>-grayscale</B>

is specified, or if the JPEG file is gray-scale; otherwise, 24-bit full-color
format is emitted.
<DT><B>-gif</B>

<DD>
Select GIF output format.  Since GIF does not support more than 256 colors,
<B>-colors 256</B>

is assumed (unless you specify a smaller number of colors).
<DT><B>-os2</B>

<DD>
Select BMP output format (OS/2 1.x flavor).  8-bit colormapped format is
emitted if
<B>-colors</B>

or
<B>-grayscale</B>

is specified, or if the JPEG file is gray-scale; otherwise, 24-bit full-color
format is emitted.
<DT><B>-pnm</B>

<DD>
Select PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM) output format (this is the default format).
PGM is emitted if the JPEG file is gray-scale or if
<B>-grayscale</B>

is specified; otherwise PPM is emitted.
<DT><B>-rle</B>

<DD>
Select RLE output format.  (Requires URT library.)
<DT><B>-targa</B>

<DD>
Select Targa output format.  Gray-scale format is emitted if the JPEG file is
gray-scale or if
<B>-grayscale</B>

is specified; otherwise, colormapped format is emitted if
<B>-colors</B>

is specified; otherwise, 24-bit full-color format is emitted.
</DL>
<P>

Switches for advanced users:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-dct int</B>

<DD>
Use integer DCT method (default).
<DT><B>-dct fast</B>

<DD>
Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).
<DT><B>-dct float</B>

<DD>
Use floating-point DCT method.
The float method is very slightly more accurate than the int method, but is
much slower unless your machine has very fast floating-point hardware.  Also
note that results of the floating-point method may vary slightly across
machines, while the integer methods should give the same results everywhere.
The fast integer method is much less accurate than the other two.
<DT><B>-dither fs</B>

<DD>
Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering in color quantization.
<DT><B>-dither ordered</B>

<DD>
Use ordered dithering in color quantization.
<DT><B>-dither none</B>

<DD>
Do not use dithering in color quantization.
By default, Floyd-Steinberg dithering is applied when quantizing colors; this
is slow but usually produces the best results.  Ordered dither is a compromise
between speed and quality; no dithering is fast but usually looks awful.  Note
that these switches have no effect unless color quantization is being done.
Ordered dither is only available in
<B>-onepass</B>

mode.
<DT><B>-map</B><I> file</I>

<DD>
Quantize to the colors used in the specified image file.  This is useful for
producing multiple files with identical color maps, or for forcing a
predefined set of colors to be used.  The
<I>file</I>

must be a GIF or PPM file. This option overrides
<B>-colors</B>

and
<B>-onepass</B>.

<DT><B>-nosmooth</B>

<DD>
Use a faster, lower-quality upsampling routine.
<DT><B>-onepass</B>

<DD>
Use one-pass instead of two-pass color quantization.  The one-pass method is
faster and needs less memory, but it produces a lower-quality image.
<B>-onepass</B>

is ignored unless you also say
<B>-colors</B>

<I>N</I>.

Also, the one-pass method is always used for gray-scale output (the two-pass
method is no improvement then).
<DT><B>-maxmemory</B><I> N</I>

<DD>
Set limit for amount of memory to use in processing large images.  Value is
in thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes if &quot;M&quot; is attached to the
number.  For example,
<B>-max 4m</B>

selects 4000000 bytes.  If more space is needed, temporary files will be used.
<DT><B>-outfile</B><I> name</I>

<DD>
Send output image to the named file, not to standard output.
<DT><B>-verbose</B>

<DD>
Enable debug printout.  More
<B>-v</B>'s

give more output.  Also, version information is printed at startup.
<DT><B>-debug</B>

<DD>
Same as
<B>-verbose</B>.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<P>

This example decompresses the JPEG file foo.jpg, quantizes it to
256 colors, and saves the output in 8-bit BMP format in foo.bmp:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>djpeg -colors 256 -bmp</B>

<I>foo.jpg</I>

<B>&gt;</B>

<I>foo.bmp</I>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HINTS</H2>

To get a quick preview of an image, use the
<B>-grayscale</B>

and/or
<B>-scale</B>

switches.
<B>-grayscale -scale 1/8</B>

is the fastest case.
<P>

Several options are available that trade off image quality to gain speed.
<B>-fast</B>

turns on the recommended settings.
<P>

<B>-dct fast</B>

and/or
<B>-nosmooth</B>

gain speed at a small sacrifice in quality.
When producing a color-quantized image,
<B>-onepass -dither ordered</B>

is fast but much lower quality than the default behavior.
<B>-dither none</B>

may give acceptable results in two-pass mode, but is seldom tolerable in
one-pass mode.
<P>

If you are fortunate enough to have very fast floating point hardware,
<B>-dct float</B> may be even faster than <B>-dct fast</B>.  But on most
machines <B>-dct float</B> is slower than <B>-dct int</B>; in this case it is
not worth using, because its theoretical accuracy advantage is too small to be
significant in practice.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>JPEGMEM</B>

<DD>
If this environment variable is set, its value is the default memory limit.
The value is specified as described for the
<B>-maxmemory</B>

switch.
<B>JPEGMEM</B>

overrides the default value specified when the program was compiled, and
itself is overridden by an explicit
<B>-maxmemory</B>.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Arithmetic coding is not supported for legal reasons.
<P>

To avoid the Unisys LZW patent,
<B>djpeg</B>

produces uncompressed GIF files.  These are larger than they should be, but
are readable by standard GIF decoders.
<P>

Still not as fast as we'd like.
