<H2>NAME</H2>

idlj - The IDL-to-Java Compiler (RMI-IIOP version)
<P>

<B>idlj</B>

generates Java bindings from a given IDL file.
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>idlj</B>

[
<I>options</I>

]
<B>idl-file</B>

<P>

where
<B>idl-file</B>

is the name of a file containing Interface Definition Language (IDL)
definitions.
<B>Options</B>

may appear in any order, but must precede the
<B>idl-file</B>.

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The IDL-to-Java Compiler generates the Java bindings for a
given IDL file.  For binding details, see the OMG IDL to Java
Language Mapping Specification. Some previous releases of the
IDL-to-Java compiler were named 
<B>idltojava</B>.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Emitting Client and Server Bindings</H2>

To generate Java bindings for an IDL file named 
<B>My.idl</B>:

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

This generates the client-side bindings and is equivalent to:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -fclient My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The client-side bindings do not include the server-side
skeleton. If you want to generate the server-side bindings for
the interfaces: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -fserver My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Server-side bindings include the client-side bindings plus the
skeleton, all of which are POA (that is, Inheritance Model) classes.
If you want to generate both client and server-side bindings,
use one of the following (equivalent) commands:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -fclient -fserver My.idl
<BR>
idlj -fall My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

There are two possible server-side models: the Inneritance Model and
the Tie Model.
<P>

NEW in 1.4! The default server-side model is the 
<B>Portable</B>

<B>Servant</B>

<B>Inheritance</B>

<B>Model</B><I>.</I>

Given an interface My defined in
<B>My.idl</B>,

the file 
<B>MyPOA.java</B>

is generated. You must provide the
implementation for 
<B>My</B>

and it must inherit from 
<B>MyPOA</B>.

<P>

<B>MyPOA.java</B>

is a stream-based skeleton that extends
<B>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</B>

and implements the
<B>InvokeHandler</B>

interface and the operations interface associated
with the IDL interface the skeleton implements. 
<P>

The 
<B>PortableServer</B>

module for the 
<B>Portable</B>Object<B>Adapter</B>

<B>(POA)</B>

defines the native Servant type. In the Java programming
language, the 
<B>Servant</B>

type is mapped to the Java
<B>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</B>

class. It serves as the base
class for all POA servant implementations and provides a
number of methods that may be invoked by the application
programmer, as well as methods which are invoked by the POA
itself and may be overridden by the user to control aspects of
servant behavior. 
<P>

Another option for the Inheritance Model is to use the
<B>-oldImplBase</B>

flag in order to generate server-side bindings that
are compatible with older version of the Java programming
language (prior to J2SE 1.4). To generate server-side bindings
that are backwards compatible: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -fclient -fserver -oldImplBase My.idl
<BR>
idlj -fall -oldImplBase My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Given an interface
<B>My</B>

defined in
<B>My.idl</B>,

the file
<B>_MyImpleBase.java</B>

is generated. You must provide the implementation for
<B>My</B>

and it must inherit from
<B>_MyImplBase</B>.

<P>

The other server-side model is called the Tie Model. This is a
delegation model. Because it is not possible to generate ties and
skeletons at the same time, they must be generated separately.
The following commands generate the bindings for the Tie
Model: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -fall My.idl
<BR>
idlj -fallTIE My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

For the interface 
<B>My</B>,

the second command generates
<B>MyPOATie.java</B>.

The constructor to 
<B>MyPOATie</B>

takes a delegate.
You must provide the implementation for delegate, but it does
not have to inherit from any other class, only the interface
<B>MyOperations</B>.

But to use it with the ORB, you must wrap your
implementation within
<B>MyPOATie</B>.

For instance: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
MyImpl myImpl = new MyImpl ();
<BR>
My POATie tie = new MyPOATie (myImpl);
<BR>
orb.connect (tie);
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

You might want to use the Tie model instead of the typical
Inheritance model if your implementation must inherit from
some other implementation. Java allows any number of interface
inheritance, but there is only one slot for class inheritance. If you
the inheritance model, that slot is used up . By using the Tie
Model, that slot is freed up for your own use. The drawback is
that it introduces a level of indirection: one extra method call
occurs when invoking a method. 
<P>

To generate server-side, Tie model bindings that are compatible
with older version of the IDL to Java language mapping in
versions of J2SE before 1.4.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -oldImplBase -fall My.idl
<BR>
idlj -oldImplBase -fallTIE My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

For the interface 
<B>My</B>,

this will generate 
<B>My_Tie.java</B>.

The constructor to 
<B>My_Tie</B>

takes a 
<B>impl</B>.

You must provide the
implementation for 
<B>impl</B>,

but it does not have to inherit from
any other class, only the interface 
<B>HelloOperations</B>.

But to use it
with the ORB, you must wrap your implementation within
<B>My_Tie</B>.

For instance: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
MyImpl myImpl = new MyImpl ();
<BR>
My_Tie tie = new My_Tie (myImpl);
<BR>
orb.connect (tie);
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Specifying Alternate Locations for Emitted Files</H2>

<BR>

If you want to direct the emitted files to a directory other than
the current directory, invoke the compiler as: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -td /altdir My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

For the interface 
<B>My</B>,

the bindings will be emitted to
<B>/altdir/My.java</B>,

etc., instead of 
<B>./My.java.</B>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Specifying Alternate Locations for Include Files</H2>

If 
<B>My.idl</B>

included another idl file, 
<B>MyOther.idl</B>,

the compiler
assumes that 
<B>MyOther.idl</B>

resides in the local directory. If it
resides in 
<B>/includes</B>,

for example, then you would invoke the
compiler with the following command: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -i /includes My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

If 
<B>My.idl</B>

also included 
<B>Another.idl</B>

that resided in
<B>/moreIncludes</B>,

for example, then you would invoke the
compiler with the following command: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -i /includes -i /moreIncludes My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Since this form of include can become irritatingly long, another
means of indicating to the compiler where to search for included
files is provided. This technique is similar to the idea of an
environment variable. Create a file named 
<B>idl.config</B>

in a
directory that is listed in your CLASSPATH. Inside of 
<B>idl.config</B>,

provide a line with the following form: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
includes=/includes;/moreIncludes
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The compiler will find this file and read in the includes list. Note
that in this example the separator character between the two
directories is a semicolon (;). This separator character is platform
dependent. On NT it is a semicolon, on Solaris it is a colon, etc.
For more information on includes, read the CLASSPATH 
documentation. 
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Emitting Bindings for Include Files</H2>

By default, only those interfaces, structs, etc, that are defined in
the idl file on the command line have Java bindings generated
for them. The types defined in included files are not generated.
For example, assume the following two idl files: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>My.idl</B>

<DD>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
#include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt; 
<BR>

interface My 
<BR>

{ 
<BR>

}; 
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>MyOther.idl</B>

<DD>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
interface MyOther 
<BR>

{ 
<BR>

};
</DL>

<P>

The following command will only generate the java bindings for
<B>My</B>:

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

To generate all of the types in 
<B>My.idl</B>

and all of the types in the
files that 
<B>My.idl</B>

includes (in this example, 
<B>MyOther.idl</B>),

use
the following command: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -emitAll My.idl 
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

There is a caveat to the default rule. 
<B>#include</B>

statements which
appear at global scope are treated as described. These 
<B>#include</B>

statements can be thought of as import statements. 
<B>#include</B>

statements which appear within some enclosing scope are
treated as true 
<B>#include</B>

statements, meaning that the code
within the included file is treated as if it appeared in the
original file and, therefore, Java bindings are emitted for it. Here
is an example: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>My.idl</B>

<DD>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
#include &lt;MyOther.idl&gt; 
<BR>

interface My 
<BR>

{ 
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#include&nbsp;&lt;Embedded.idl&gt;&nbsp;
<BR>

}; 
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>MyOther.idl</B>

<DD>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
interface MyOther 
<BR>

{ 
<BR>

}; 
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Embedded.idl</B>

<DD>
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
enum E {one, two, three};
</DL>

<P>

Running the following command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

will generate the following list of Java files:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Notice that 
<B>MyOther.java</B>

was not generated because it is
defined in an import-like 
<B>#include</B>.

But 
<B>E.java</B>

was generated
because it was defined in a true 
<B>#include</B>.

Also notice that since
<B>Embedded.idl</B>

was included within the scope of the interface 
<B>My</B>,

it appears within the scope of 
<B>My</B>

(that is,in 
<B>MyPackage</B>).

<P>

If the 
<B>-emitAll</B>

flag had been used in the previous example, then
all types in all included files would be emitted. 
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Inserting Package Prefixes</H2>

Suppose that you work for a company named ABC that has
constructed the following IDL file: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Widgets. idl</B>

<DD>
module Widgets 
<BR>

{ 
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;interface&nbsp;W1&nbsp;{...};&nbsp;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;interface&nbsp;W2&nbsp;{...};&nbsp;
<BR>

}; 
</DL>
<P>

Running this file through the IDL-to-Java compiler will place the
Java bindings for W1 and W2 within the package Widgets. But
there is an industry convention that states that a company's
packages should reside within a package named 
<B>com.&lt;company</B>name&gt;<B>.</B>

The 
<B>Widgets</B>

package is not good enough. To follow
convention, it should be 
<B>com.abc.Widgets</B>.

To place this package
prefix onto the 
<B>Widgets</B>

module, execute the following: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -pkgPrefix Widgets com.abc Widgets.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

If you have an IDL file which includes 
<B>Widgets.idl</B>,

the
<B>-pkgPrefix</B>

flag must appear in that command also. If it does
not, then your IDL file will be looking for a 
<B>Widgets</B>

package
rather than a 
<B>com.abc.Widgets</B>

package. 
<P>

If you have a number of these packages that require prefixes, it
might be easier to place them into the 
<B>idl.config</B>

file described
above. Each package prefix line should be of the form: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
PkgPrefix.&lt;type&gt;=&lt;prefix&gt;
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

So the line for the above example would be:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
PkgPrefix.Widgets=com.abc
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The use of this options does not affect the Repository ID.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Defining Symbols Before Compilation</H2>

You may need to define a symbol for compilation that is not
defined within the IDL file, perhaps to include debugging code
in the bindings. The command 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -d MYDEF My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

is the equivalent of putting the line 
<B>#define</B>

<B>MYDEF</B>

inside
<B>My.idl</B>.

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Preserving Pre-Existing Bindings</H2>

If the Java binding files already exist, the 
<B>-keep</B>

flag will keep
the compiler from overwriting them. The default is to generate
all files without considering if they already exist. If you've
customized those files (which you should not do unless you are
very comfortable with their contents), then the 
<B>-keep</B>

option is
very useful. The command 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -keep My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

emit all client-side bindings that do not already exist.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Viewing Progress of Compilation</H2>

The IDL-to-Java compiler will generate status messages as it
progresses through its phases of execution. Use the 
<B>-v</B>

option to
activate this &quot;verbose&quot; mode: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -v My.idl
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

By default the compiler does not operate in verbose mode.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Displaying Version Information</H2>

To display the build version of the IDL-to-Java compiler, specify
the 
<B>-version</B>

option on the command-line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
idlj -version 
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Version information also appears within the bindings generated
by the compiler. Any additional options appearing on the
command-line are ignored. 
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-d</B><I> symbol</I>

<DD>
This is equivalent to the following line in an IDL file:
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
#define symbol
</PRE>


</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-emitAll</B>

<DD>
Emit all types, including those found in
<B>#include</B>

files.
<DT><B>-fside</B>

<DD>
Defines what bindings to emit. 
<B>side</B>

is one of 
<B>client,</B>

<B>server,</B>

<B>serverTIE,</B>

<B>all,</B>

or 
<B>allTIE.</B>The

<B>-fserverTIE</B>and

<B>-fallTIE</B>

options cause delegate model skeletons to be
emitted. Assumes 
<B>-fclient</B>

if the flag is not specified. 
<DT><B>-i</B><I> include-path</I>

<DD>
By default, the current directory is scanned for included
files. This option adds another directory. 
<DT><B>-keep</B>

<DD>
If a file to be generated already exists, do not overwrite it.
By default it is overwritten. 
<DT><B>-noWarn</B>

<DD>
Supresses warning messages.
<DT><B>-oldImplBase</B>

<DD>
Generates skeletons compatible with old (pre-1.4) JDK
ORBs. By default, the POA Inheritance Model server-side
bindings are generated. This option provides
backward-compatibility with older versions of the Java
programming language by generating server-side
bindings that are 
<B>ImplBase</B>

Inheritance Model classes. 
<DT><B>-pkgPrefix</B><I> type prefix</I>

<DD>
Wherever 
<B>type</B>

is encountered at file scope, prefix the
generated Java package name with 
<B>prefix</B>

for all files
generated for that type. The 
<B>type</B>

is the simple name of
either a top-level module, or an IDL type defined outside
of any module. 
<DT><B>-pkgTranslate</B><I> type package</I>

<DD>
Wherever the type or module name 
<B>type</B>

is encountered,
replace it in the with 
<B>package</B>

for all files in the
generated Java package. Note that 
<B>pkgPrefix</B>

changes are
made first. 
<B>type</B>

is the simple name of either a top-level
module, or an IDL type defined outside of any module,
and must match the full package name exactly. Also note
that the following package names cannot be translated: 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
