<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<I>lamboot</I>

tool starts the LAM software on each of the machines specified in the
boot schema,
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>.

The boot schema specifies the hostnames of nodes to be used in the
run-time MPI environment, and optionally lists how may CPUs LAM may
used on each node.
The user may wish to first run the <A HREF="../man1/recon.1.php">recon</A>(1) tool to verify that LAM can
be started.
<P>

Starting LAM is a three step procedure.  In the first step, <A HREF="../man1/hboot.1.php">hboot</A>(1)
is invoked on each of the specified machines.  Then each machine
allocates a dynamic port and communicates it back to
<I>lamboot</I>

which collects them.  In the third step,
<I>lamboot</I>

gives each machine the list of machines/ports in order to form a fully
connected topology.  If any machine was not able to start, or if a
timeout period expires before the first step completes,
<I>lamboot</I>

invokes <A HREF="../man1/wipe.1.php">wipe</A>(1) to terminate LAM and reports the error.
<P>

The
<I>&lt;bhost&gt; </I>

file is a LAM boot schema written in the host file syntax.  See
<A HREF="../man5/bhost.5.php">bhost</A>(5).  Instead of the command line, a boot schema can be specified
in the LAMBHOST environment variable.  Otherwise a default file,
lam-bhost.def, is used.  LAM searches for
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

first in the local directory and then in the installation directory
under etc/.
<P>

In addition,
<I>lamboot</I>

uses a process schema for the individual LAM nodes.  A process schema
(see <A HREF="../man5/conf.5.php">conf</A>(5)) is a description of the processes which constitute the
operating system on a node.  In general, the system administrator
maintains this file -- LAM/MPI users will generally not need to change
this file.  It is also possible for the user to customize the LAM
software with a private process schema.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The bhost file</H3>

The format of the
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

file is documented in the <A HREF="../man5/bhost.5.php">bhost</A>(5) man page.
<P>

<I>lamboot</I>

will resolve all names in
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

on the node in which 
<I>lamboot</I>

was invoked (the origin node).  After that, LAM will only use IP
addresses, not names.  Specifically, the name resolution configuration
on all other nodes is not used.  Hence, the the origin node must be
able to resolve all the names in
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

to addresses that are reachable by all other nodes.  
<P>

A common mistake is to list
<I>localhost</I>

(or any name that resolves to the special address 127.0.0.1 -- the
loopback TCP/IP device) in a
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

file that contains other nodes.  In this case, the address 127.0.0.1
would be sent to each of the other nodes as the address of the origin
node.  If the other nodes try to use 127.0.0.1 to contact the origin
node, they will actually be contacting themselves, and would
eventually timeout and fail.
<P>

The IP addresses obtained from
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

are used for LAM's meta messages: startup and shutdown of jobs,
out-of-band messages used for coordination, etc.  The amount of
traffic is fairly low (unless using the &quot;lamd&quot; mode of MPI message
passing, in which case all MPI traffic will also utilize LAM's meta
messages for transport -- see <A HREF="../man1/mpirun.1.php">mpirun</A>(1)).  When using the TCP RPI,
these IP addresses are also used for MPI message passing via direct
sockets between each pair of nodes.
<P>

A common case is where a &quot;master&quot; node has multiple network interface
cards (NICs) -- one that is connected to a public network, and one
that is connected to a private network where parallel jobs are to be
run.  To include the master node in a
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

file, the IP name (or address) of the NIC on the private network
should be listed in
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>.

This ensures that all the other nodes can reach the master node on the
private network.
<P>

As another example, some configurations have multiple TCP/IP NICs in
each node of a parallel job.  One NIC is considered &quot;slow&quot; (e.g.,
10Mbps), while the other is considered &quot;fast&quot; (e.g., 100Mbps).  It is
desirable to allow LAM to take advantage of the higher bandwidth on
the &quot;fast&quot; network for MPI messages.  As such,
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

should list the IP names (or addresses) of all the &quot;fast&quot; NICs.
However, if the LAM RPI does not use TCP/IP (e.g., the Myrinet/GM
RPI), the
<I>&lt;bhost&gt;</I>

file should probably list the &quot;slow&quot; NICs so that LAM's meta message
traffic does not cause overhead and potentially detract from
performance on the &quot;fast&quot; network from other high-performance
applications.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Delaying hostname lookups</H3>

<P>

Normally, name resolution of hostnames is done on the machines where
<I>lamboot</I>

is invoked.  This is done for optimization reasons, so that the list
of hostnames only needs to be resolved once (potentially minimizing
the amount of DNS or other hostname-lookup network traffic).
<P>

However, in some non-uniform networking environments, this is not
sufficient because each host may have a different IP address on each
of its peers.  For example, host A may have address Z on host B, but
have address Y on host C.
<P>

The 
<I>-l</I>

option to 
<I>lamboot</I>

will cause LAM to distribute hostnames to each node rather than a
fully resolved set of IP addresses.  Hence, each node where LAM is
booted will do its own name resolution on the list of hostnames.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>SSI (System Services Interface)</H3>

The
<I>-ssi</I>

switch allows the passing of parameters to various SSI modules.  LAM's
SSI modules are described in detail in <A HREF="../man7/lamssi.7.php">lamssi</A>(7).  SSI modules have
direct impact on MPI programs because they allow tunable parameters to
be set at run time (such as which boot device driver to use, what
parameters to pass to that driver, etc.).
<P>

The 
<I>-ssi</I>

switch takes two arguments:
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

and 
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>.

The
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

argument generally specifies which SSI module will receive the value.
For example, the
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

&quot;boot&quot; is used to select which RPI to be used for starting processes
on remote nodes.  The
<I>&lt;value&gt; </I>

argument is the value that is passed.  For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>lamboot -ssi boot tm<DD>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;tm&quot; boot module for native launching in PBSPro /
OpenPBS environments (the tm boot module does not require a boot
schema).
<DT>lamboot -ssi boot rsh -ssi rsh_agent &quot;ssh -x&quot; boot_schema<DD>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;rsh&quot; boot module, and tells the rsh module to
use &quot;ssh -x&quot; as the specific agent to launch executables on remote
nodes.
</DL>
<P>

And so on.  LAM's boot SSI modules are described in <A HREF="../man7/lamssi_boot.7.php">lamssi_boot</A>(7).
This page should be consulted for specific actions that are taken by,
and how to tweak the run-time behavior of each boot module.
<P>

The 
<I>-ssi</I>

switch can be used multiple times to specify different
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

and/or
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>

arguments.  If the same
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

is specified more than once, the
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>s

are concatenated with a comma (&quot;,&quot;) separating them.
<P>

Note that the 
<I>-ssi</I>

switch is simply a shortcut for setting environment variables.  The
same effect may be accomplished by setting corresponding environment
variables before running
<I>lamboot</I>.

The form of the environment variables that LAM sets are:
<I>LAM_MPI_SSI_&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</I>.

<P>

Note that the
<I>-ssi</I>

switch overrides any previously set environment variables.  Also note
that unknown
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

arguments are still set as environment variable -- they are not
checked (by
<I>wipe</I>)

for correctness.  Illegal or incorrect 
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>

arguments may or may not be reported -- it depends on the specific SSI
module.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Remote Executable Invocation</H3>

<P>

All tweakable aspects of launching executables on remote nodes during 
<I>lamboot</I>

are discussed in <A HREF="../man7/lamssi.7.php">lamssi</A>(7) and <A HREF="../man7/lamssi_boot.7.php">lamssi_boot</A>(7).  Topics include (but
are not limited to): discovery of remote shell, run-time overrides of
the agent use to launch remote executables (e.g., rsh and ssh), etc.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Closing stdio</H3>

The stdio of each LAM daemon on a remote host that is launched by 
<I>lamboot</I>

is closed by default.  Normally, the stdio of the LAM daemon launched
on the local host is left open so that the internal LAM <A HREF="../man3/tstdio.3.php">tstdio</A>(3)
package works properly.  However, it is sometimes desirable to close
the stdio of the local LAM daemon as well.  For example:
<P>


<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rsh&nbsp;somenode&nbsp;lamboot&nbsp;-s&nbsp;hostfile

<P>

This is because
<I>rsh</I>

waits for two conditions before exiting: 
<I>lamboot</I>

to exit, and stdout / stderr to be closed.  Without
<I>-s</I>,

stdout / stderr would not be closed, and 
<I>rsh</I>

(and
<I>ssh</I>)

will hang even though 
<I>lamboot</I>

had completed.
<I>-s</I>

causes the stdout / stderr of the local LAM daemon to be closed upon
invocation, which will allow 
<I>rsh</I>

to complete.  Using
<I>-s</I>

will not affect
<I>lamboot</I>

in any other way, but it will prevent the <A HREF="../man3/tstdio.3.php">tstdio</A>(3) package from
working properly.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Fault Tolerance</H3>

If the
<I>-x</I>

option is given, LAM runs in fault tolerant mode.  In this mode, nodes
exchange ``heart beat'' messages periodically to make sure all nodes
are running and the links connecting them are operational.  When a
node's heart beats stop, it is declared ``dead'' and all LAM nodes
(and processes) are notified.  This allows users to write fault
tolerant applications that can degrade gracefully, or fully recover by
replacing the defunct node with another (see <A HREF="../man1/lamgrow.1.php">lamgrow</A>(1)).  Since this
mode introduces a performance penalty, it is not activated by default.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
