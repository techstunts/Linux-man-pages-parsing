<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>cscope</I>

is an interactive, screen-oriented tool that allows the user to
browse through C source files for specified elements of code.
<P>

By default, 
<I>cscope</I>

examines the C (.c and .h), lex (.l), and yacc (.y)
source files in the current directory.
<I>cscope</I>

may also be invoked for
source files named on the command line. In either case, 
<I>cscope</I>

searches the standard directories for #include files that it does not
find in the current directory. 
<I>cscope</I>

uses a symbol cross-reference, called 
cscope.out by default, to locate functions, function calls, macros,
variables, and preprocessor symbols in the files.
<P>

<I>cscope</I>

builds the symbol cross-reference the first time it is used on
the source files for the program being browsed. On a subsequent
invocation, 
<I>cscope</I>

rebuilds the cross-reference only if a source file
has changed or the list of source files is different. When the
cross-reference is rebuilt, the data for the unchanged files are
copied from the old cross-reference, which makes rebuilding faster
than the initial build.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS  </H2>

Some command line arguments can only occur as the the ony argument in
the execution of cscope.  They cause the program to just print out
some output and exit immediately:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
View the long usage help display.
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
Print on the first line of screen the version number of cscope.
<DT><B>--help</B>

<DD>
Same as
<B>-h</B>

<DT><B>--version</B>

<DD>
Same as
<B>-V</B>

<P>
</DL>
<P>

The following options can appear in any combination:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b</B>

<DD>
Build the cross-reference only.
<DT><B>-C</B>

<DD>
Ignore letter case when searching.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Use only ASCII characters in the cross-reference file, that is,
do not compress the data.
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Do not update the cross-reference.
<DT><B>-e</B>

<DD>
Suppress the &lt;Ctrl&gt;-e command prompt between files.
<DT><B>-F</B><I>symfile</I>

<DD>
Read symbol reference lines from 
<I>symfile. </I>

(A symbol reference
file is created by &gt; and &gt;&gt;, and can also be read using the &lt;
command, described under ``Issuing Subsequent Requests,''
below.)
<DT><B>-f</B><I>reffile</I>

<DD>
Use 
<I>reffile </I>

as the cross-reference file name instead of the default &quot;cscope.out&quot;.
<DT><B>-I</B><I>incdir</I>

<DD>
Look in 
<I>incdir </I>

(before looking in $INCDIR, the standard place
for header files, normally /usr/include) for any #include files
whose names do not begin with ``/'' and that are not specified
on the command line or in 
<I>namefile </I>

below. (The #include files
may be specified with either double quotes or angle brackets.)
The incdir directory is searched in addition to the current
directory (which is searched first) and the standard list
(which is searched last). If more than one occurrence of -I
appears, the directories are searched in the order they appear
on the command line.
<DT><B>-i</B><I>namefile</I>

<DD>
Browse through all source files whose names are listed in 
<I>namefile</I>

(file names separated by spaces, tabs, or new-lines) instead of the
default name list file, which is called cscope.files. If this option
is specified, cscope ignores any file names appearing on the command
line. The argument namefile can be set to ``-'' to accept a list of
files from the standard input.  Filenames in the namefile that contain
whitespace have to be enclosed in &quot;double quotes&quot;.  Inside such quoted
filenames, any double-quote and backslash characters have to be
escaped by backslashes.
<DT><B>-k</B>

<DD>
``Kernel Mode'', turns off the use of the default include dir
(usually /usr/include) when building the database, since kernel
source trees generally do not use it.
<DT><B>-L</B>

<DD>
Do a single search with line-oriented output when used with the
-num pattern option.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
Line-oriented interface (see ``Line-Oriented Interface''
below).
<DT><B>-[</B><I>0-9</I><B>]</B><I>pattern</I>

<DD>
Go to input field 
<I>num </I>

(counting from 0) and find 
<I>pattern.</I>

<DT><B>-P</B><I>path</I>

<DD>
Prepend 
<I>path </I>

to relative file names in a pre-built cross-reference file so you do
not have to change to the directory where the cross-reference file was
built. This option is only valid with the -d option.
<DT><B>-p</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Display the last
<I>n </I>

file path components instead of the default (1). Use 
<I>0 </I>

to not display the file name at all.
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>
Enable fast symbol lookup via an inverted index. This option
causes cscope to create 2 more files (default names
``cscope.in.out'' and ``cscope.po.out'') in addition to the normal
database. This allows a faster symbol search algorithm that
provides noticeably faster lookup performance for large projects.
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Recurse subdirectories during search for source files.
<DT><B>-s</B><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Look in
<I>dir</I>

for additional source files. This option is ignored if source files
are given on the command line.
<DT><B>-T</B>

<DD>
Use only the first eight characters to match against C symbols.
A regular expression containing special characters other than a
period (.) will not match any symbol if its minimum length is
greater than eight characters.
<DT><B>-U</B>

<DD>
Check file time stamps. This option will update the time stamp
on the database even if no files have changed.
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>
Unconditionally build the cross-reference file (assume that all
files have changed).
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Be more verbose in line-oriented mode.  Output progress updates during
database building and searches.
<DT><I>files</I>

<DD>
A list of file names to operate on.
</DL>
<P>

The -I, -c, -k, -p, -q, and -T options can also be in the cscope.files file.
<P>

<B>Requesting the initial search</B>

<P>

After the cross-reference is ready, cscope will display this menu:
<P>

<B>Find this C symbol:</B>

<DT><B>?</B>

<DD>
Give help information about cscope commands.
<DT><B>Special keys</B>

<DD>
</DL>
<P>

If your terminal has arrow keys that work in vi, you can use them
to move around the input fields. The up-arrow key is useful to move to
the previous
input field instead of using the &lt;Tab&gt; key repeatedly. If you have
&lt;CLEAR&gt;, &lt;NEXT&gt;, or &lt;PREV&gt; keys they will act as the ^l, +, and -
commands, respectively.
<P>

<B>Line-Oriented interface</B>

<P>

The -l option lets you use cscope where a screen-oriented interface
would not be useful, for example, from another screen-oriented
program.
<P>

cscope will prompt with &gt;&gt; when it is ready for an input line starting
with the field number (counting from 0) immediately followed by the
search pattern, for example, ``lmain'' finds the definition of the
main function.
<P>

If you just want a single search, instead of the -l option use the -L
and -num pattern options, and you won't get the &gt;&gt; prompt.
<P>

For -l, cscope outputs the number of reference lines
cscope: 2 lines
<P>

For each reference found, cscope outputs a line consisting of the file
name, function name, line number, and line text, separated by spaces,
for example,
main.c main 161 main(argc, argv)
<P>

Note that the editor is not called to display a single reference,
unlike the screen-oriented interface.
<P>

You can use the c command to toggle ignore/use letter case when
searching. (When ignoring letter case, search for ``FILE'' will match
``File'' and ``file''.)
<P>

You can use the r command to rebuild the database.
<P>

cscope will quit when it detects end-of-file, or when the first
character of an input line is ``^d'' or ``q''.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>CSCOPE_EDITOR</B>

<DD>
Overrides the EDITOR and VIEWER variables. Use this if you wish to use
a different editor with cscope than that specified by your
EDITOR/VIEWER variables.
<DT><B>CSCOPE_LINEFLAG</B>

<DD>
Format of the line number flag for your editor. By default, cscope
invokes your editor via the equivalent of ``editor +N file'', where
``N'' is the line number that the editor should jump to. This format
is used by both emacs and vi. If your editor needs something
different, specify it in this variable, with ``%s'' as a placeholder
for the line number.  Ex: if your editor needs to be invoked as
``editor -#103 file'' to go to line 103, set this variable to
``-#%s''.
<DT><B>CSCOPE_LINEFLAG_AFTER_FILE</B>

<DD>
Set this variable to ``yes'' if your editor needs to be invoked with
the line number option after the filename to be edited. To continue
the example from CSCOPE_LINEFLAG, above: if your editor needs to see
``editor file -#number'', set this environment variable. Users of most
standard editors (vi, emacs) do not need to set this variable.
<DT><B>EDITOR</B>

<DD>
Preferred editor, which defaults to vi.
<DT><B>HOME</B>

<DD>
Home directory, which is automatically set at login.
<DT><B>INCLUDEDIRS</B>

<DD>
Colon-separated list of directories to search for #include
files.
<DT><B>SHELL</B>

<DD>
Preferred shell, which defaults to sh.
<DT><B>SOURCEDIRS</B>

<DD>
Colon-separated list of directories to search for additional
source files.
<DT><B>TERM</B>

<DD>
Terminal type, which must be a screen terminal.
<DT><B>TERMINFO</B>

<DD>
Terminal information directory full path name. If your terminal
is not in the standard terminfo directory, see curses
and terminfo for how to make your own terminal description.
<DT><B>TMPDIR</B>

<DD>
Temporary file directory, which defaults to /var/tmp.
<DT><B>VIEWER</B>

<DD>
Preferred file display program (such as less), which overrides
EDITOR (see above).
<DT><B>VPATH</B>

<DD>
A colon-separated list of directories, each of which has the
same directory structure below it. If VPATH is set, cscope
searches for source files in the directories specified; if it
is not set, cscope searches only in the current directory.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>cscope.files</B>

<DD>
Default files containing -I, -p, -q, and -T options and the
list of source files (overridden by the -i option).
<DT><B>cscope.out</B>

<DD>
Symbol cross-reference file (overridden by the -f option),
which is put in the home directory if it cannot be created in
the current directory.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>cscope.in.out</B>

<DT><B>cscope.po.out</B>

<DD>

Default files containing the inverted index used for quick
symbol searching (-q option). If you use the -f option to
rename the cross-reference file (so it's not cscope.out), the
names for these inverted index files will be created by adding
<BR>&nbsp;.in&nbsp;and&nbsp;.po&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;you&nbsp;supply&nbsp;with&nbsp;-f.&nbsp;For&nbsp;example,&nbsp;if&nbsp;you
indicated -f xyz, then these files would be named xyz.in and
xyz.po.
<DT><B>INCDIR</B>

<DD>
Standard directory for #include files (usually /usr/include).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Notices</H2>

<I>cscope</I>

recognizes function definitions of the form:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>fname blank ( args ) white arg_decs white {<DD>

<DT>where:<DD>
<I>fname</I>

is the function name
<DT><I>blank</I>

<DD>
is zero or more spaces or tabs, not including newlines
<DT><I>args</I>

<DD>
is any string that does not contain a ``&quot;'' or a newline
<DT><I>white</I>

<DD>
is zero or more spaces, tabs, or newlines
<DT><I>arg_decs</I>

<DD>
are zero or more argument declarations (arg_decs may include
comments and white space)
</DL>
<P>

It is not necessary for a function declaration to start at the
beginning of a line. The return type may precede the function name;
cscope will still recognize the declaration. Function definitions that
deviate from this form will not be recognized by cscope.
<P>

The ``Function'' column of the search output for the menu option Find
functions called by this function: input field will only display the
first function called in the line, that is, for this function
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;e()
<BR>&nbsp;{
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;(f()&nbsp;+&nbsp;g());
<BR>&nbsp;}
<P>

the display would be
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Functions&nbsp;called&nbsp;by&nbsp;this&nbsp;function:&nbsp;e
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;File&nbsp;Function&nbsp;Line
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.c&nbsp;f&nbsp;3&nbsp;return(f()&nbsp;+&nbsp;g());
<P>

Occasionally, a function definition or call may not be recognized
because of braces inside #if statements. Similarly, the use of a
variable may be incorrectly recognized as a definition.
<P>

A 
<B>typedef</B>

name preceding a preprocessor statement will be incorrectly
recognized as a global definition, for example,
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;LDFILE&nbsp;&nbsp;*
<BR>&nbsp;#if&nbsp;AR16WR
<P>

Preprocessor statements can also prevent the recognition of a global
definition, for example,
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;char&nbsp;flag
<BR>&nbsp;#ifdef&nbsp;ALLOCATE_STORAGE
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1
<BR>&nbsp;#endif
<BR>&nbsp;;
<P>

A function declaration inside a function is incorrectly recognized as
a function call, for example,
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;f()
<BR>&nbsp;{
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void&nbsp;g();
<BR>&nbsp;}
<P>

is incorrectly recognized as a call to g.
<P>

<I>cscope</I>

recognizes C++ classes by looking for the class keyword, but
doesn't recognize that a struct is also a class, so it doesn't
recognize inline member function definitions in a structure. It also
doesn't expect the class keyword in a
<I>typedef</I>

, so it incorrectly
recognizes X as a definition in
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;typedef&nbsp;class&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;Y;
<P>

It also doesn't recognize operator function definitions
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;Bool&nbsp;Feature::operator==(const&nbsp;Feature&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;other)
<BR>&nbsp;{
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>&nbsp;}
<P>

Nor does it recognize function definitions with a function pointer
argument
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;ParseTable::Recognize(int&nbsp;startState,&nbsp;char&nbsp;*pattern,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int&nbsp;finishState,&nbsp;void&nbsp;(*FinalAction)(char&nbsp;*))
<BR>&nbsp;{
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<BR>&nbsp;}
