<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>xdvi</B>

is a program which runs under the X window system. It is used to preview
<I>dvi</I>

files, such as are produced by
<B><A HREF="../man1/tex.1.php">tex</A></B>(1).

<P>

This program has the capability of showing the file shrunken by various
(integer) factors, and also has a ``magnifying glass'' which allows one
to see a small part of the unshrunk image momentarily. It has also support
for
hyperlinks in DVI files (see section HYPERLINKS below),
direct rendering of Postscript&lt;tm&gt; Type1 fonts (see section T1LIB below), and
source specials in the .dvi file (see section SOURCE SPECIALS below).
<P>

Before displaying any page or part thereof, it checks to see if the
<I>dvi</I>

file has changed since the last time it was displayed.  If this is the case,
then
<B>xdvi</B>

will reinitialize itself for the new
<I>dvi</I>

file.  For this reason, exposing parts of the
<B>xdvi</B>

window while TeX is running should be avoided.  This feature allows you
to preview many versions of the same file while running
<B>xdvi</B>

only once.
<P>

In addition to using keystrokes to move within the file,
<B>xdvi</B>

provides buttons on the right side of the window, which are synonymous
with various sequences of keystrokes.
<P>

<B>xdvi</B>

can show PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials by any of three methods.
It will try first to use Display PostScript&lt;tm&gt;, then NeWS, then it
will try to use Ghostscript to render the images.  All of these options
depend on additional software to work properly; moreover, some of them
may not be compiled into this copy of
<B>xdvi</B>.

<P>

For performance reasons,
<B>xdvi</B>

does not render PostScript specials in the magnifying glass.
<P>

If
<I>dvi_file</I>

is not specified, a file-selection widget is popped up for you to choose the
<I>dvi</I>

file.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

In addition to specifying the
<I>dvi</I>

file (with or without the
<B>.dvi</B>

extension),
<B>xdvi</B>

supports the following command line options.  If the option begins with a
`<B>+</B>'

instead of a
`<B>-</B>',

the option is restored to its default value.  By default, these options can
be set via the resource names given in parentheses in the description of
each option.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+</B><I>page</I>

<DD>
Specifies the first page to show.  If
<B>+</B>

is given without a number, the last page is assumed; the first page is
the default.
<DT><B>-allowshell</B>

<DD>
(<B>.allowShell</B>)

This option enables the shell escape in PostScript specials.
(For security reasons, shell escapes are disabled by default.)
This option should be rarely used; in particular it should not be used just
to uncompress files: that function is done automatically if the file name
ends in
<B>.Z</B>,

<B>.gz</B>,

or
<B>.bz2</B>.

Shell escapes are always turned off if the
<B>-safer</B>

option is used.
<DT><B>-altfont</B><I> font</I>

<DD>
(<B>.altFont</B>)

Declares a default font to use when the font in the
<I>dvi</I>

file cannot be found.  This is useful, for example, with PostScript &lt;tm&gt; fonts.
<DT><B>-background</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
(<B>.background</B>)

Determines the color of the background.  Same as
<B>-bg</B>.

<DT><B>-base</B><I> base URL</I>

<DD>
(<B>.urlBase</B>)

Sets the base URL value that external links given in the
<I>dvi</I>

file are assumed relative to - normally this should be the URL
of the document itself (?).
<DT><B>-bd</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
(<B>.borderColor</B>)

Determines the color of the window border.
<DT><B>-bg</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
(<B>.background</B>)

Determines the color of the background.
<DT><B>-bordercolor</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
Same as
<B>-bd</B>.

<DT><B>-borderwidth</B><I> width</I>

<DD>
(<B>.borderWidth</B>)

Specifies the width of the border of the window.  Same as
<B>-bw</B>.

<DT><B>-browser</B><I> WWWbrowser</I>

<DD>
(<B>.wwwBrowser</B>)

Defines the World Wide Web browser to be used to handle external URL's,
for example mosaic.  If neither the command-line option nor the X
resource are set, uses the environment variable WWWBROWSER.
<DT><B>-bw</B><I> width</I>

<DD>
(<B>.borderWidth</B>)

Specifies the width of the border of the window.
<DT><B>-copy</B>

<DD>
(<B>.copy</B>)

Always use the
<I>copy</I>

operation when writing characters to the display.
This option may be necessary for correct operation on a color display, but
overstrike characters will be incorrect.
If greyscale anti-aliasing is in use, the
<B>-copy</B>

operation will disable the use of colorplanes and make overstrikes come
out incorrectly.
See also
<B>-thorough</B>.

<DT><B>-cr</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
(<B>.cursorColor</B>)

Determines the color of the mouse cursor.  The default is the color of the page
border.
<DT><B>-debug</B><I> bitmask</I>

<DD>
(<B>.debugLevel</B>)

If nonzero, prints additional information on standard output.  The
bitmask is specified as a decimal number. Multiple values can
be specified by adding the respective numbers; e.g. to debug all
all file searching and opening commands, use 4000
(= 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 32). Use -1 to turn on debugging
of everything (this will produce huge output).
The individual bits/numbers have the following meanings:
<PRE>


          1         Bitmaps
          2         DVI translation
          4         PK fonts

</PRE>

Some of the Kpathsea debugging options are actually provided by Kpathsea;
see the Debugging section in the Kpathsea manual for more information on
these.
<DT><B>-density</B><I> density</I>

<DD>
(<B>.densityPercent</B>)

Determines the density used when shrinking bitmaps for fonts.
A higher value produces a lighter font.  The default value is 40.
If greyscaling is in use, this argument does not apply; use
<B>-gamma</B>

instead.
See also the
`<B>S</B>'

keystroke.
Same as
<B>-S</B>.

<DT><B>-display</B><I> host</I><B>:</B><I>display</I>

<DD>
Specifies the host and screen to be used for displaying the
<I>dvi</I>

file.  By default this is obtained from the environment variable
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DISPLAY.</B></FONT>
<DT><B>-editor</B><I> editor</I>

<DD>
(<B>.editor</B>)

Specifies the editor that will be invoked when the
<I>source-special()</I>

action is triggered (by default via CTRL-Mouse 1).
The argument to this option is a format string in which occurrences of
``<B>%f</B>''

are replaced by the file name, occurrences of
``<B>%l</B>''

are replaced by the line number within the file, and optional
occurrences of
``<B>%c</B>''

are replaced by the column number within the line.
If no
``<B>%f</B>''

or
``<B>%l</B>''

occurs in the string, a warning is given






and the missing designators
are appended.
<P>
If neither the option nor the X resource
<I>.editor</I>

is specified, the following environment variables are checked
to determine the editor command:
<B>XEDITOR</B>,

<B>VISUAL</B>,

and
<B>EDITOR </B>

(in this sequence). If the string is found as the value
of the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>VISUAL</B></FONT>
or
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>EDITOR</B></FONT>
environment variables, then
``<I>xterm -e ''</I>

is prepended to the string; if the editor is specified by other means, then
it must be in the form of a shell command to pop up an X window with an
editor in it. If none of these variables is set, the command
``<I>xterm -e vi %s +%d''</I>

is used and a warning message is given.
<P>
A new instance of the editor is started each time this command is used;
therefore it is preferrable to use an editor that can be invoked in
`client' mode to load new files into the same instance. Example
settings are:
<P>
<I>emacsclient --no-wait +%l %f</I>

(older Emacsen),
<P>
<I>gnuclient -q +%l %f</I>

(XEmacs and newer Emacsen)
<P>
<I>nc +%l %f</I>

(nedit)
<P>
Note that those strings need to be enclosed
into quotes when using them on the command-line
to protect them from the shell; when using them
as argument for the
<I>.editor</I>

resource in an X resource file, no quotes should be used.
<P>
<B>NOTE ON SECURITY:</B>

The argument of this option isn't executed as a shell command,
but via
<I>exec()</I>

to prevent evil tricks with the contents of source specials.
Execution of the
<I>-editor</I>

command is disabled when the
<I>-safer</I>

option is used.
<DT><B>-expert</B>

<DD>
(<B>.expert</B>)

Prevent the buttons from appearing.  See also the
`<B>x</B>'

keystroke.
<DT><B>-fg</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
(<B>.foreground</B>)

Determines the color of the text (foreground).
<DT><B>-foreground</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
Same as
<B>-fg</B>.

<DT><B>-font</B><I> font</I>

<DD>
(<B>*font</B>)

Sets the font for use in the buttons.
<DT><B>-gamma</B><I> gamma</I>

<DD>
(<B>.gamma</B>)

Controls the interpolation of colors in the greyscale anti-aliasing color
palette.  Default value is 1.0.  For 0 &lt;
<I>gamma</I>

&lt; 1, the fonts will be lighter (more like the background), and for
<I>gamma</I>

&gt; 1, the fonts will be darker (more like the foreground).  Negative
values behave the same way, but use a slightly different algorithm.
For color and grayscale displays; for monochrome, see
<B>-density</B>.

See also the
`<B>S</B>'

keystroke.
<DT><B>-rulecolor</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
(<B>.ruleColor</B>)

Determines the color of the rules used for the the magnifier
and the `grid'
(default: foreground color).
<DT><B>-geometry</B><I> geometry</I>

<DD>
(<B>*geometry</B>)

Specifies the initial geometry of the window.
<DT><B>-gspalette</B><I> palette</I>

<DD>
(<B>.palette</B>)

Specifies the palette to be used when using Ghostscript for rendering
PostScript specials.  Possible values are
<B>Color</B>,

<B>Greyscale</B>,

and
<B>Monochrome</B>.

The default is
<B>Color</B>.

<DT><B>-gsalpha</B>

<DD>
(<B>.gsAlpha</B>)

Causes
<B>Ghostscript</B>

to be called with the
<B>x11alpha</B>

driver instead of the
<B>x11</B>

driver.  The
<B>x11alpha</B>

driver enables anti-aliasing in PostScript specials, for a nicer appearance.
It is available on newer versions of
<B>Ghostscript</B>.

This option can also be toggled with the
`<B>V</B>'

keystroke.
<DT><B>-sourceposition</B> <I>line</I>[<B>:</B><I>col</I>][&nbsp;]<I>filename</I><DD>
This option makes xdvi start in `client mode' to perform a
`forward search'. The main dvi file
<I>dvi_file</I>

is specified on the command line as usual. `Forward search' means that
xdvi will try to open the page in
<I>dvi_file</I>

corresponding to the
<I>line</I>

(optionally also the
<I>column</I>)

and
<I>filename</I>

of the .tex source, and highlight the place found by drawing a rectangle
in
<I>highlight</I>

colour (see the
<I>-hl</I>

option) around the corresponding text.
(This only works when the
<I>dvi_file</I>

has been prepared with source special information;
see the section SOURCE SPECIALS for more information on this.)
<P>
`Client mode' means that if there is already
another instance of xdvi running on this X display and displaying the
same
<I>dvi_file</I>,

a new instance started with the
<I>-sourceposition</I>

option will only notify that running instance to perform the forward
search, and exit after that. This way, other programs such such as
text editors may invoke xdvi in `client mode' to jump to a specific
place in the .dvi file corresponding to the current mouse cursor position
in the .tex file.
<P>
The argument for
<I>filename</I>

should be a string with the same extension as the file name used
for the source specials in the
<I>dvi</I>

file. The space before
<I>filename</I>

is only needed if the filename starts
with a digit.  When the space is used, the argument
needs to be encosed in quotes to prevent the shell from
misinterpreting the space as argument separator.
<DT><B>-hl</B><I> color</I>

<DD>
(<B>.highlight</B>)

Determines the color of the page border.  The default is the foreground color.
<DT><B>-hush</B>

<DD>
(<B>.Hush</B>)

Causes
<B>xdvi</B>

to suppress all suppressible warnings.
<DT><B>-hushchars</B>

<DD>
(<B>.hushLostChars</B>)

Causes
<B>xdvi</B>

to suppress warnings about references to characters which are not defined
in the font.
<DT><B>-hushchecksums</B>

<DD>
(<B>.hushChecksums</B>)

Causes
<B>xdvi</B>

to suppress warnings about checksum mismatches between the
<I>dvi</I>

file and the font file.
<DT><B>-hushspecials</B>

<DD>
(<B>.hushSpecials</B>)

Causes
<B>xdvi</B>

to suppress warnings about
<B>\special</B>

strings that it cannot process.
<DT><B>-hushstdout</B>

<DD>
(<B>.hushStdout</B>)

Causes
<B>xdvi</B>

to suppress all status informations it would normally print to
stdout if the statusline is disabled.
<DT><B>-icongeometry</B><I> geometry</I>

<DD>
(<B>.iconGeometry</B>)

Specifies the initial position for the icon.
<DT><B>-iconic</B>

<DD>
(<B>.iconic</B>)

Causes the
<B>xdvi</B>

window to start in the iconic state.  The default is to start with the
window open.
<DT><B>-install</B>

<DD>
(<B>.install</B>)

If
<B>xdvi</B>

is running under a
<B>PseudoColor</B>

visual, then (by default) it will check for
<B>TrueColor</B>

visuals with more bits per pixel, and switch to such a visual if one exists.
If no such visual exists, it will use the current visual and colormap.  If
<B>-install</B>

is selected, however, it will still use a
<B>TrueColor</B>

visual with a greater depth, if one is available; otherwise, it will
install its own colormap on the current visual.  If the current visual is not
<B>PseudoColor</B>,

then
<B>xdvi</B>

will not switch the visual or colormap, regardless of its options.
The default value of the
<B>install</B>

resource is the special value,
<B>maybe</B>.

There is no
<B>+install</B>

option.  See also
<B>-noinstall</B>,

and the GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS section.
<DT><B>-interpreter</B><I> filename</I>

<DD>
(<B>.interpreter</B>)

Use
<I>filename</I>

as the Ghostscript interpreter.  By default it uses
<B>gs</B>.

<DT><B>-keep</B>

<DD>
(<B>.keepPosition</B>)

Sets a flag to indicate that
<B>xdvi</B>

should not move to the home position when moving to a new page.  See also the
`<B>k</B>'

keystroke.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
(<B>.listFonts</B>)

Causes the names of the fonts used to be listed.
<DT><B>-margins</B><I> dimen</I>

<DD>
(<B>.Margin</B>)

Specifies the size of both the top margin and side margin.
This determines the ``home'' position of the page within the window as
follows.  If the entire page fits in the window, then the margin settings
are ignored.  If, even after removing the margins from the left, right,
top, and bottom, the page still cannot fit in the window, then the page
is put in the window such that the top and left margins are hidden, and
presumably the upper left-hand corner of the text on the page will be
in the upper left-hand corner of the window.
Otherwise, the text is centered in the window.
The dimension should be a decimal number optionally followed by
any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by TeX
(<B>pt</B>,

<B>pc</B>,

<B>in</B>,

<B>bp</B>,

<B>cm</B>,

<B>mm</B>,

<B>dd</B>,

<B>cc</B>,

or
<B>sp</B>).

By default, the unit will be
<B>cm</B> (centimeters).

See also
<B>-sidemargin</B>, <B>-topmargin</B>,

and the keystroke
`<B>M</B>.'

<DT><B>-mfmode</B><I> mode-def</I>

<DD>
(<B>.mfMode</B>)

Specifies a
<I>mode-def</I>

string, which can be used in searching for fonts (see ENVIRONMENT, below).
Generally, when changing the
<I>mode-def</I>,

it is also necessary to change the font size to the appropriate value
for that mode.  This is done by adding a colon and the value in dots per inch;
for example,
<B>-mfmode ljfour:600</B>.

This method overrides any value given by the
<B>pixelsPerInch</B>

resource or the
<B>-p</B>

command-line argument.
The metafont mode is also passed to
<B>metafont</B>

during automatic creation of fonts.
By default, it is
<B>unspecified</B>.

<DT><B>-mgs</B><I> size</I>

<DD>
Same as
<B>-mgs1</B>.

<DT><B>-mgs</B>[<I>n</I>]<I> size</I>

<DD>
(<B>.magnifierSize</B>[<I>n</I>])

Specifies the size of the window to be used for the ``magnifying glass''
for Button
<I>n</I>.

The size may be given as an integer (indicating that the magnifying glass
is to be square), or it may be given in the form
<I>width</I>x<I>height</I>.

See the MOUSE ACTIONS section.  Defaults are 200x150, 400x250, 700x500,
1000x800, and 1200x1200.
<DT><B>-noghostscript</B>

<DD>
(<B>.ghostscript</B>)

Inhibits the use of Ghostscript for displaying PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials.
(For this option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
<B>-noghostscript</B>

corresponds to
<B>ghostscript:off</B>;

<B>+noghostscript</B>

to
<B>ghostscript:on</B>.)

<DT><B>-nogrey</B>

<DD>
(<B>.grey</B>)

Turns off the use of greyscale anti-aliasing when printing shrunken bitmaps.
(For this option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
<B>-nogrey</B>

corresponds to
<B>grey:off</B>;

<B>+nogrey</B>

to
<B>grey:on</B>.)

See also the
`<B>G</B>'

keystroke.
<DT><B>-nogssafer</B>

<DD>
(<B>.gsSafer</B>)

Normally, if Ghostscript is used to render PostScript specials, the Ghostscript
interpreter is run with the option
<B>-dSAFER</B>.

The
<B>-nogssafer</B>

option runs Ghostscript without
<B>-dSAFER</B>.

The
<B>-dSAFER</B>

option in Ghostscript disables PostScript operators such as
<B>deletefile</B>,

to prevent possibly malicious PostScript programs from having any effect.
If the
<B>-safer</B>

option is specified, then this option has no effect; in that case Ghostscript
is always run with
<B>-dSAFER</B>.

(For the
<B>-nogssafer</B>

option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
<B>-nogssafer</B>

corresponds to
<B>gsSafer:off</B>;

<B>+nogssafer</B>

to
<B>gsSafer:on</B>.)

<DT><B>-noinstall</B>

<DD>
(<B>.install</B>)

Inhibit the default behavior of switching to a
<B>TrueColor</B>

visual if one is available with more bits per pixel than the current visual.
This option corresponds to a resource of
<B>install:off</B>.

There is no
<B>+noinstall</B>

option.  See also
<B>-install</B>,

and the GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS section.
<DT><B>-nomakepk</B>

<DD>
(<B>.makePk</B>)

Turns off automatic generation of font files that cannot be found by other
means.
(For this option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
<B>-nomakepk</B>

corresponds to
<B>makePk:off</B>;

<B>+nomakepk</B>

to
<B>makePK:on</B>.)

<DT><B>-nopostscript</B>

<DD>
(<B>.postscript</B>)

Turns off rendering of PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials.  Bounding boxes, if known,
will be displayed instead.  This option can also be toggled with the
`<B>v</B>'

keystroke.
(For this option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
<B>-nopostscript</B>

corresponds to
<B>postscript:off</B>;

<B>+postscript</B>

to
<B>postscript:on</B>.)

<DT><B>-noscan</B>

<DD>
(<B>.prescan</B>)

Normally, when PostScript&lt;tm&gt; is turned on,
<B>xdvi</B>

will do a preliminary scan of the
<I>dvi</I>

file, in order to send any necessary header files before sending the
PostScript code that requires them.  This option turns off such prescanning.
(It will be automatically be turned back on if
<B>xdvi</B>

detects any specials that require headers.)  (For the
<B>-noscan</B>

option, the logic of the corresponding resource is reversed:
<B>-noscan</B>

corresponds to
<B>prescan:off</B>;

<B>+noscan</B>

to
<B>prescan:on</B>.)

<DT><B>-offsets</B><I> dimen</I>

<DD>
(<B>.Offset</B>)

Specifies the size of both the horizontal and vertical offsets of the
output on the page.  By decree of the Stanford TeX Project,
the default TeX page origin is always 1 inch over and down from
the top-left page corner, even when non-American paper sizes are used.
Therefore, the default offsets are 1.0 inch.
The argument
<I>dimen</I>

should be a decimal number optionally followed by any of the two-letter
abbreviations for units accepted by TeX
(<B>pt</B>,

<B>pc</B>,

<B>in</B>,

<B>bp</B>,

<B>cm</B>,

<B>mm</B>,

<B>dd</B>,

<B>cc</B>,

or
<B>sp</B>).

By default, the unit will be
<B>cm</B> (centimeters).

See also
<B>-xoffset</B>

and
<B>-yoffset</B>.

<DT><B>-p</B><I> pixels</I>

<DD>
(<B>.pixelsPerInch</B>)

Defines the size of the fonts to use, in pixels per inch.  The
default value is 600.  This option is provided only for backwards
compatibility; the preferred way of setting the font size is by setting the
Metafont mode at the same time; see the
<B>-mfmode</B>

option.
<DT><B>-paper</B><I> papertype</I>

<DD>
(<B>.paper</B>)

Specifies the size of the printed page.  This may be of the form
<I>width</I><B>x</B><I>height</I> optionally followed by a unit, where
<I>width</I>

and
<I>height</I>

are decimal numbers giving the width and height of the paper, respectively,
and the unit is any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted
by TeX
(<B>pt</B>,

<B>pc</B>,

<B>in</B>,

<B>bp</B>,

<B>cm</B>,

<B>mm</B>,

<B>dd</B>,

<B>cc</B>,

or
<B>sp</B>).

By default, the unit will be
<B>cm</B> (centimeters).

There are also synonyms which may be used:
<B>us</B>

(8.5x11in),
<B>legal</B>

(8.5x14in),
<B>foolscap</B>

(13.5x17in),
as well as the ISO sizes
<B>a1</B>-<B>a7</B>,

<B>b1</B>-<B>b7</B>,

<B>c1</B>-<B>c7</B>.

For each of these there also exists a landscape or `rotated'
variant:
<B>usr</B>

(11x8.5in),
<B>a1r</B>-<B>a7r</B>,

etc.  The default size is 21 x 29.7 cm (A4 size).
<DT><B>-rv</B>

<DD>
(<B>.reverseVideo</B>)

Causes the page to be displayed with white characters on a black background,
instead of vice versa.
<DT><B>-s</B><I> shrink</I>

<DD>
(<B>.shrinkFactor</B>)

Defines the initial shrink factor.  The default value is 8.  If
<I>shrink</I>

is given as 0, then the initial shrink factor is computed so that the
page fits within the window (as if the `s' keystroke were given without
a number).
<DT><B>-S</B><I> density</I>

<DD>
(<B>.densityPercent</B>)

Same as
<B>-density</B>,

<I>q.v.</I>

<DT><B>-safer</B>

<DD>
(<B>.safer</B>)

This option turns on all available security options; it is designed for use when
<B>xdvi</B>

is called by a browser that obtains a
<I>dvi</I>

or TeX file from another site.
This option turns off evalutation of source specials (see SOURCE SPECIALS for details).
Furthermore, it selects
<B>+nogssafer</B>

and
<B>+allowshell</B>.

<DT><B>-shrinkbutton</B><I>n shrink</I>

<DD>
(<B>.shrinkButton</B><I>n</I>)

Specifies that the
<I>n</I>th

button changing shrink factors shall change to shrink factor
<I>factor</I>.

This is useful, e.g., when using 600 dpi fonts, since in that case shrinking
by a factor of 4 is still not enough.  Here
<I>n</I>

may be a number from 1 to 3 (in the default button layout, the ``Full Size''
button is unaffected by these options).  If the buttons are customized,
higher values of
<I>n</I>

(up to 9) may be used.
<DT><B>-sidemargin</B><I> dimen</I>

<DD>
(<B>.sideMargin</B>)

Specifies the side margin (see
<B>-margins</B>).

<DT><B>-statusline</B>

<DD>
(<B>.statusline</B>)

Display the statusline at the bottom of the window.
The statusline can be suppressed by
<B>+statusline</B>.

This can also be toggled with the
`<B>1x</B>'

keystroke. If displaying the statusline is disabled, the messages
that would normally be printed to the statusline will be printed to
<I>stdout</I>.

To suppress printing all messages, use the
<B>-hushstdout</B>

option.
<DT><B>-thorough</B>

<DD>
(<B>.thorough</B>)

<B>xdvi</B>

will usually try to ensure that overstrike characters
(<I>e.g.</I>,

<B>\notin</B>)

are printed correctly.  On monochrome displays, this is always possible
with one logical operation, either
<I>and</I>

or
<I>or</I>.

On color displays, however, this may take two operations, one to set the
appropriate bits and one to clear other bits.  If this is the case, then
by default
<B>xdvi</B>

will instead use the
<I>copy</I>

operation, which does not handle overstriking correctly.  The
<B>-thorough</B>

option chooses the slower but more correct choice.  See also
<B>-copy</B>.

<DT><B>-topmargin</B><I> dimen</I>

<DD>
(<B>.topMargin</B>)

Specifies the top and bottom margins (see
<B>-margins</B>).

<DT><B>-not1lib</B>

<DD>
(<B>.not1lib</B>)

This will disable the use of T1Lib to display PostScript&lt;tm&gt; fonts.
Use this option as a workaround when you encounter problems with the
display of T1Lib (but please don't forget to send a bug report in
this case, to the URL mentioned in the section AUTHORS below).
<DT><B>-underlink</B>

<DD>
(<B>.underLink</B>)

Underline links.  Default is true.
<DT><B>-version</B>

<DD>
Print information on the version of
<B>xdvi</B>.

<DT><B>-warnspecials</B>

<DD>
(<B>.warnSpecials</B>)

Causes
<B>xdvi</B>

to issue warnings about
<B>\special</B>

strings that it cannot process.
<DT><B>-wheelunit</B><I> pixels</I>

<DD>
(<B>.wheelUnit</B>)

Sets the number of pixels that a motion of a wheel mouse will move the
image up or down.  If set to zero, the wheel mouse functionality is disabled.
The default value is 80.
<DT><B>-xoffset</B><I> dimen</I>

<DD>
(<B>.xOffset</B>)

Specifies the size of the horizontal offset of the output on the page.  See
<B>-offsets</B>.

<DT><B>-yoffset</B><I> dimen</I>

<DD>
(<B>.yOffset</B>)

Specifies the size of the vertical offset of the output on the page.  See
<B>-offsets</B>.

<H2>KEYSTROKES</H2>

<B>xdvi</B>

recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its window.
Each may optionally be preceded by a (positive or negative) number, whose
interpretation will depend on the particular keystroke.
The number can be discarded by pressing the ``Escape'' key.
Also, the ``Help'', ``Home'', ``Prior'' and ``Next'' keys
are synonyms for
`<B>?</B>',

`<B>^</B>',

`<B>b</B>',

and
`<B>f</B>'

keys, respectively.
<P>

The key assignments given here are those that
<B>xdvi</B>

assigns by default.  They can be changed--see CUSTOMIZATION, below.
The names appearing in brackets at the beginning of each of the following
keystroke definitions is the name assigned to the action associated with
that key, for use when customizing.  Users who do not customize their
keystrokes may ignore these labels.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>q</B>

<DD>
[<B>quit()</B>]

if already at the top of the page.  The BackSpace key will also do this.
<DT><B>g</B>

<DD>
[<B>goto-page()</B>]

Moves to the page with the given number.  Initially, the first page is assumed
to be page number 1, but this can be changed with the
`<B>P</B>'

keystroke, below.  If no page number is given, then it goes to the last page.
<DT><B>P</B>

<DD>
[<B>declare-page-number()</B>]

``This is page number
<I>n</I>.''

This can be used to make the
`<B>g</B>'

keystroke refer to actual page numbers instead of absolute page numbers.
<DT><B>Control-L</B>

<DD>
[<B>forward-page(0)</B>]

Redisplays the current page.
<DT><B>^</B>

<DD>
[<B>home()</B>]

Move to the ``home'' position of the page.  This is normally the upper
left-hand corner of the page, depending on the margins as described in the
<B>-margins</B>

option, above.
<DT><B>Up arrow</B>

<DD>
[<B>up(0.015)</B>]

Scrolls page up.

<DD>
[<B>center()</B>]

Moves the page so that the point currently beneath the mouse cursor is moved to
the middle of the window, and warps the mouse cursor to the same place.
<DT><B>M</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-margins()</B>]

Sets the margins so that the point currently under the mouse cursor defines
the upper left-hand corner of the text in the page.  Note that the command
does
<I>not</I>

move the image, but only determines the margins
for the page switching commands. For details on how the margins
are used, see the
<B>-margins</B>

option.
<DT><B>s</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-shrink-factor()</B>]

Changes the shrink factor to the given number.  If no number is given, the
smallest factor that makes the entire page fit in the window will be used.
(Margins are ignored in this computation.)
<DT><B>S</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-density()</B>]

Sets the density factor to be used when shrinking bitmaps.  This should
be a number between 0 and 100; higher numbers produce lighter characters.
If greyscaling mode is in effect, this changes the value of gamma instead.
The new value of gamma is the given number divided by 100; negative values
are allowed.
<DT><B>R</B>

<DD>
[<B>reread-dvi-file()</B>]

Forces the
<I>dvi</I>

file to be reread.  This allows you to preview many versions of the same
file while running
<B>xdvi</B>

only once.
<DT><B>k</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-keep-flag()</B>]

Normally when
<B>xdvi</B>

switches pages, it moves to the home position as well.  The
`<B>k</B>'

keystroke toggles a `keep-position' flag which, when set, will keep
the same position when moving between pages.  Also
`<B>0k</B>'

and
`<B>1k</B>'

clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the
<B>-keep</B>

option.
<DT><B>ESC</B>

<DD>
[<B>discard-number()</B>]

The escape key discards the numerical prefix for all actions
(useful when you mistyped a number).
<DT><B>x</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-expert-mode()</B>]

Toggles expert mode (in which the buttons do not appear). Typing
`<B>1x</B>'

toggles the display  of the statusline at the bottom of
the window. See also the options
<B>-expert</B>

and
<B>-statusline</B>.

<DT><B>Control-v</B>

<DD>
[<B>show-source-specials()</B>]

Show bounding boxes for every source special on the current page, and print
the strings contained in these specials to stderr. With prefix 1,
show every bounding box on the page. This is for debugging purposes mainly.
<DT><B>Control-x</B>

<DD>
[<B>source-what-special()</B>]

Display information about the source special next to the mouse cursor in the
statusline. This is the same special that would be found by
<I>source-special() ,</I>

but without invoking the editor. For debugging purposes.
<DT><B>G</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-greyscaling()</B>]

This key toggles the use of greyscale anti-aliasing for displaying shrunken
bitmaps.  In addition, the key sequences
`<B>0G</B>'

and
`<B>1G</B>'

clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the
<B>-nogrey</B>

option.
<P>
If given a numeric argument that is not 0 or 1, greyscale anti-aliasing is
turned on, and the gamma resource is set to the value divided by
100. E.g.,
`<B>150G</B>'

turns on greyscale and sets gamma to 1.5.
<DT><B>B</B>

<DD>
[<B>htex-back()</B>]

This key jumps back to the previous hyperlink anchor. See the
section
<B>HYPERLINKS</B>

for more information on navigating the links.
<DT><B>D</B>

<DD>
[<B>toggle-grid-mode()</B>]

This key toggles the use of grid over the document.
If no number is given, the grid mode toggles. 
By prepending number, 3 grid levels can be set.
See also the
<B>-rulecolor</B>

option.
<DT><B>v</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-ps()</B>]

This key toggles the rendering of PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials.  If rendering
is turned off, then bounding boxes are displayed when available.
In addition the key sequences
`<B>0v</B>'

and
`<B>1v</B>'

clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the
<B>-nopostscript</B>

option.
<DT><B>Control-F</B>

<DD>
[<B>select-dvi-file()</B>]

Read a new 
<I>dvi</I>

file. A file-selection widget is popped up for you to choose the dvi
file from.
<DT><B>V</B>

<DD>
[<B>set-gs-alpha()</B>]

This key toggles the anti-aliasing of PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials when
<B>Ghostscript</B>

is used as renderer.  In addition the key sequences
`<B>0V</B>'

and
`<B>1V</B>'

clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the
<B>-gsalpha</B>

option.
<DT><B>?</B>

<DD>
[<B>help()</B>]

Pops up a help window with a short explanation of the most important key
bindings and concepts. The help texts and menu entries are fully configurable
via the following X resources (the defaults strings are given in parentheses,
or as 
<I>&lt;Text&gt;</I>

<H2>MOUSE ACTIONS</H2>

If the shrink factor is set to any number other than one, then clicking
mouse button 3 
will pop up a ``magnifying glass'' which shows the unshrunk
image in the vicinity of the mouse click.  This subwindow disappears when
the mouse button is released.  Different mouse buttons produce different sized
windows, as indicated by the
<B>-mgs</B>

option.  Moving the mouse cursor while holding the button down will move the
magnifying glass. To access this feature via customization, use the
<B>magnifier</B>

action.  Its argument is either a string of the form
<I>width</I>x<I>height</I>,

as in the
<B>-mgs</B><I>n</I>

command-line option, or one of the strings
<B>*1</B>

through
<B>*5</B>,

referring to the value specified by the corresponding
<B>-mgs</B><I>n</I>

option.
<P>

Holding down the
<I>CTRL</I>

key and clicking on mouse button 1 starts a ``reverse search''
(action <B> source-special()</B>; see the section on SOURCE SPECIALS for details).
<P>

The scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard way:  pushing Button 2
in a scrollbar moves the top or left edge of the scrollbar to that point
and optionally drags it;
pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right by an amount equal to the distance
from the button press to the upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing
Button 3 moves the image down or left by the same amount.
<P>

The image can also be dragged around, by holding down the shift key
and a mouse button.  Shift-button 1 allows dragging in all directions,
Shift-button 2 allows vertical dragging only, and Shift-button 3
horizontal dragging only. To access these actions via customization, use the
<B>drag</B>

action.  This action should have one parameter, the character
``<B>|</B>'',

``<B>-</B>'',

or
``<B>+</B>'',

indicating vertical dragging, horizontal dragging, or dragging in both
directions.
<P>

Wheel mice are supported:  motion of the wheel on such a mouse moves the
image up or down by the number of pixels indicated by the
<B>-wheelunit</B>

option.  To access this option via customization, use the
<B>wheel</B>

action.  This action takes one parameter, giving the distance to scroll
the image.  If the parameter contains a decimal point, the distance is given
in wheel units; otherwise, pixels.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HYPERLINKS</H2>

Usually, if a binding specifies more then one action, all actions
are executed in a sequence. The hyperlink bindings
<B>do-href()</B>

and
<B>do-href-newwindow()</B>

are special in that they are used as an
<I>alternative</I>

to other actions that might follow them
<I>if</I>

the mouse is currently located on a hyperlink.
In this case, none of the other actions will be executed.
Otherwise,
<I>only</I>

the other actions are executed.
The action
<B>do-href()</B>

jumps to the link target in the current xdvi
window (possibly changing the page), and
<B>do-href-newwindow()</B>

opens a new instance of xdvi
with the link target. In both cases, the location of the target is
indicated by a small arrow drawn in
<B>highlight</B>

color
in the left corner of the window.
<P>

As an example, consider the following settings, which are the default
settings for buttons 1 and 2:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
xdvi.mainTranslations: #override \
&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: do-href()magnifier(*1)\n\
&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: do-href-newwindow()magnifier(*2)\n\
&lt;Btn3Down&gt;: magnifier(*3)\n

</B></PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The fact that the mouse is located over a hyperlink is indicated by
(a) changing the pointer to a hand shape, and (b) displaying the link
target in the statusline at the bottom of the window.
<P>

If a link points to a file which is not a DVI file (e.g. HTML, or
PostScript), the files
<B>mime.types</B>

and
<B>mailcap</B>

are parsed to determine a suitable viewer; if no suitable
<B>mailcap</B>

entry was found, if the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>WWWBROWSER</B></FONT>
environment variable is set, or
<B>-browser</B>

was specified on the command line, the browser is launched to load the file.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>UNBOUND ACTIONS</H2>

The following actions have not been assigned any keystroke, but are available
if customization is used.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>shrink-to-dpi()</B>

<DD>
This action takes one (required) argument.  It sets the shrink factor to
an integer so as to approximate the use of fonts with the corresponding
number of dots per inch.  If
<B>xdvi</B>

is using fonts scaled for
<I>p</I>

dots per inch, and the argument to
<B>shrink-to-dpi</B>

is
<I>n</I>,

then the corresponding shrink factor is the ratio
<I>p</I>/<I>n</I>,

rounded to the nearest integer.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CUSTOMIZATION</H2>

Key and mouse button assignments can be changed by setting the
<B>mainTranslations</B>

resource to a string of translations as defined in the documentation for the
X toolkit.  The actions should take the form of action names as given in the
KEYSTROKES and MOUSE ACTIONS sections.
<P>

Key actions will usually be without arguments, or they may give an argument
to replace an optional number typed immediately prior to the action.  The keys
<B>0</B>-<B>9</B>

and hyphen cannot be reassigned, since they are used for inputting numbers.
<P>

Some key actions may take special arguments, as follows. The argument of
<B>goto-page</B>

may be the letter
`<B>e</B>',

indicating the action of going to the end of the document.
The argument of
<B>set-shrink-factor</B>

may be the letter
`<B>a</B>',

indicating that the shrink factor should be set to the smallest value such that
the page will fit in the window.
Finally, actions that would perform a toggle, such as
<B>set-keep-flag</B>,

may be the letter
`<B>t</B>',

indicating that the action should toggle regardless of what number may have
been typed recently.
<P>

Mouse actions should refer only to
<B>ButtonPress</B>

events (e.g.,
<B>&lt;Btn1Down&gt;:magnifier(*1)</B>).

The corresponding motion and release events will then be handled internally.
A key action may be bound to a mouse event, but not vice versa.
<P>

Usually the string of translations should begin with
``<B>#override</B>'',

indicating that the default key and mouse button assignments should not
be discarded.
<P>

When keys or mouse buttons involving modifiers (such as Ctrl or Shift)
are customized together with their non-modified equivalents, the modified
keys should come first, for example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
xdvi.mainTranslations: #override \
Ctrl&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: magnifier(*3)\n\
Shift&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: magnifier(*2)\n\
&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: magnifier(*1)\n

</B></PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Because
<B>xdvi</B>

needs to capture pointer motion events, and because the X Toolkit
translations mechanism cannot accommodate both motion events and double-click
events at the same time, it is not possible to specify double-click
actions in
<B>xdvi</B>

customizations.  For information on this and other aspects of translations,
see the X Toolkit Intrinsics documentation.
<P>

There is no command-line option to set the
<B>mainTranslations</B>

resource, since changing this resource on the command line would be cumbersome.
To set the resource for testing purposes, use the
<B>-xrm</B>

command-line option provided by the X toolkit.  For example,
<B>xdvi -xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: #override &quot;z&quot;:quit()' ...</B>
or
<B>xdvi -xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: #override &lt;Key&gt;z:quit()' ...</B>

will cause the key
`<B>z</B>'

to quit
<B>xdvi</B>.

<P>

Support of wheel mice is controlled by the
<B>wheelTranslations</B>

resource.  Generally the only action routine called by this resource should be
<B>wheel</B>.

The default value is
``<B>&lt;Btn4Down&gt;:wheel(-1.)\n&lt;Btn5Down&gt;:wheel(1.)</B>''.
Because this resource is implemented differently from the others, it should
not begin with
``#override<B>'';</B>

when specifying a value for this resource, all wheel actions should be
included.
<P>

The button labels and actions may also be customized, in a similar manner.
In this case the resource
<B>buttonTranslations</B>

should consist of a string describing the button labels and the associated
actions.  The string consists of substrings, separated by the newline
character
(`<B>\n</B>'),
each describing one button.  Each substring consists of a string (to be
used as the button's label), a colon, and a sequence of actions to be
performed when the button is pushed.  Unlike the situation with key actions,
an action associated to a button should provide an argument (if applicable).
<P>

The default setting is as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
xdvi.buttonTranslations: \
Quit:quit() \n\
Open:select-dvi-file()\n\
Reread:reread-dvi-file()\n\
Help:help()\n\n\

$%%:shrink-to-dpi(100)\n\
$%%:shrink-to-dpi(50)\n\n\
View PS:set-ps(toggle)\n\
Back:htex-back()\n

</B></PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The label string may contain a colon if it is escaped by a backslash
(`<B>\</B>').  It also may contain some special sequences tied to the
<B>-shrinkbutton</B><I>n</I>

command-line options.  If the characters
`<B>$#</B>'

occur, then they are replaced by the argument of the corresponding
<B>-shrinkbutton</B>

command-line option (if present).  If no corresponding
<B>-shrinkbutton</B>

option was given, then the value is taken from the list of actions, which
is expected to contain at least one
<B>set-shrink-factor</B>

or
<B>shrink-to-dpi</B>

action.  Likewise, the character sequence
`<B>$%</B>'

will be replaced by the percentage corresponding to the shrink factor,
determined as above.  In order for the
<B>-shrinkbutton</B>

option to affect a given button, the label string must contain one of the
character sequences
`<B>$#</B>',

`<B>$%</B>',

or
'<B>$_</B>'.

This last string flags a button to be affected by a
<B>-shrinkbutton</B>

option, without making any numbers appear in the label text (the
`<B>$_</B>'

will not appear in the label text).
<P>

Some resources are provided to allow customization of the geometry of
the command buttons.  Again, they are not changeable via command-line
options, other than via the
<B>-xrm</B>

option.  All of these resources take integer values.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>buttonSideSpacing</B>

<DD>
The number of pixels to be placed on either side of the buttons.
The default value is 6.
<DT><B>buttonTopSpacing</B>

<DD>
The number of pixels between the top button and the top of the window.
The default value is 50.
<DT><B>buttonBetweenSpacing</B>

<DD>
The number of pixels between most buttons.
The default value is 20.
<DT><B>buttonBetweenExtra</B>

<DD>
The number of pixels of additional space to be inserted if the
<B>buttonTranslations</B>

resource string contains an extra newline character.
The default value is 50.
<DT><B>buttonBorderWidth</B>

<DD>
The border width of the button windows.  The default value is 1.

<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

When
<B>xdvi</B>

receives a
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIGUSR1</B></FONT>
signal, it rereads the
<I>dvi</I>

file.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS</H2>

The greyscale anti-aliasing feature in
<B>xdvi</B>

will not work at its best if the display does not have enough colors available.
This can happen if other applications are using most of the colormap
(even if they are iconified).  If this occurs, then
<B>xdvi</B>

will print an error message and turn on the
<B>-copy</B>

option.  This will result in overstrike characters appearing wrong;
it may also result in poor display quality if the number of available
colors is very small.
<P>

Typically this problem occurs on displays that allocate eight bits
of video memory per pixel.  To see how many bits per pixel your display
uses, type
<B>xwininfo</B>

in an
<B>xterm</B>

window, and then click the mouse on the root window when asked.  The
``Depth:'' entry will tell you how many bits are allocated per pixel.
<P>

Displays using at least 15 bits per pixel are typically
<B>TrueColor</B>

visuals, which do not have this problem, since their colormap is
permanently allocated and available to all applications.  (The visual
class is also displayed by
<B>xwininfo</B>.)

For more information on visual classes see the documentation for the
X Window System.
<P>

To alleviate this problem, therefore, one may (a) run with more bits
per pixel (this may require adding more video memory or replacing the video
card), (b) shut down other applications that may be using much of the colormap
and then restart
<B>xdvi</B>,

or (c) run
<B>xdvi</B>

with the
<B>-install</B>

option.
<P>

One application which is often the cause of this problem is
<B>Netscape</B>.

In this case there are two more alternatives to remedying the situation.
One can run
``<B>netscape -install</B>''

to cause
<B>Netscape</B>

to install a private colormap.  This can cause colors to change in
bizarre ways when the mouse is moved to a different window.
Or, one can run
``<B>netscape -ncols 220</B>''

to limit
<B>Netscape</B>

to a smaller number of colors.  A smaller number will ensure that
other applications have more colors available, but will degrade the
color quality in the
<B>Netscape</B>

window.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

Please see the
<B>kpathsea</B>

documentation.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HANDLING OF POSTSCRIPT FIGURES</H2>

<B>xdvi</B>

can display Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files included in the
<I>dvi</I>

file.  Such files are first searched for in the directory where the
<I>dvi</I>

file is, and then using normal
<B>Kpathsea</B>

rules.  There is an exception to this, however:  if the file name begins
with a backtick
(<B>`</B>),

then the remaining characters in the file name give a shell command (often
<B>zcat</B>)

which is executed; its standard output is then sent to be interpreted as
PostScript.  Note that there is some potential for security problems here;
see the
<B>-allowshell</B>

command-line option.  It is better to use compressed files directly (see below).
<P>

If a file name is given (as opposed to a shell command),
if that file name ends in
``<B>.Z</B>''

or
``<B>.gz</B>'',

and if the first two bytes of the file indicate that it was compressed with
<B><A HREF="../man1/compress.1.php">compress</A></B>(1)

or
<B><A HREF="../man1/gzip.1.php">gzip</A></B>(1),

respectively, then the file is first uncompressed with
<B>uncompress -c</B>

or
<B>gunzip -c</B>,

respectively.  This is preferred over using a backtick to call the command
directly, since you do not have to specify
<B>-allowshell</B>

and since it allows for path searching.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>T1LIB</H2>

T1Lib is a library written by Rainer Menzner (see <A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/);">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/);</A>
using it,
<B>xdvi</B>

can now render Postscript&lt;tm&gt; Type1 fonts directly, without the
route via TeX pixel
(<B>pk</B>)

fonts. The advantage of this is that only one size of each font needs
to be kept on disk.
Unless the
<B>-not1lib</B>

option is used,
<B>xdvi</B>

will try to render every font using T1Lib. Only as a fallback, it will
invoke an external program (like
<B>mktexpk</B>,

which in turn might invoke utilities like
<B>ps2pk</B>

or
<B>gsftopk</B>)

to generate a pixel font from the Type1 source. The direct rendering
of the
<B>Computer Modern</B>

fonts should work out-of-the box, whereas other Type1 fonts such as
the 35 `standard' Postscript&lt;tm&gt; fonts resident in printers might need
to be made accessible for use with T1Lib/xdvi, unless your system
administrator has already done so. The
<B>xdvik</B>

distribution comes with a utility called
<B>t1mapper</B>

to make these fonts visible for T1Lib/xdvi.
See the manual page for <A HREF="../man1/t1mapper.1.php">t1mapper</A>(1) for details
on how to use this utility.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOURCE SPECIALS</H2>

Some TeX implementations or macro packages provide the facility to
automatically include so-called `source specials' into a .dvi file.
These contain the line number, eventually a column number, and the
filename of the .tex source. This makes it possible to jump from a .dvi
file to the corresponding place in the .tex source and back (also
called `reverse search' and `forward search').

To be usable with
<B>xdvi</B>,

source specials in the
<I>dvi</I>

file must have one of the following formats:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

    <B>src:</B><I>line</I>[ ]<I>filename</I>
    <B>src:</B><I>line</I><B>:</B><I>col</I>[ ]<I>filename</I>
    <B>src:</B><I>line</I>
    <B>src:</B><I>line</I><B>:</B><I>col</I>
    <B>src::</B><I>col</I>

</PRE>

</DL>

If
<I>filename</I>

or
<I>line</I>

are omitted, the most recent values are used.  The first source special on
each page must be in one of the first two forms, since defaults are not
inherited across pages.
<P>
You will need a TeX implementation or a macro package
(such as
<I>srcltx.sty</I>

or
<I>srctex.sty</I>

, available from CTAN)
to insert such source specials into the dvi file.
<P>
For reverse search, you can use the combination
<I>CTRL-Mouse 1</I>

to make xdvi open an editor (the value of the
<I>-editor</I>

command line option) with the file and the line number of the .tex
source. (See the description of the
<I>-editor</I>

option for more information
and examples.)

For forward search,
<B>xdvi</B>

has a
<I>-sourceposition</I>

option that makes
<B>xdvi</B>

jump  jump to the page in
the .dvi file corresponding to the line number and the file name
and highlight the line found. See the description of the
<I>-sourceposition</I>

for more details.
<P>
The evaluation of source specials is disabled when the
<B>-safer</B>

option is used.
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

<B>xdvik</B>

uses the same environment variables and algorithms for finding
font files as TeX and friends.  See the documentation for the
<B>Kpathsea</B>

library for details (repeating it here is too cumbersome).  In addition,
<B>xdvik</B>

accepts the following variables:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DISPLAY</B></FONT>
<DD>
Specifies which graphics display terminal to use.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>KPATHSEA_DEBUG</B></FONT>
<DD>
Trace
<B>Kpathsea</B>

lookups; set it to
<B>-1</B>

for complete tracing.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MIMELIBDIR</B></FONT>
<DD>
Directory containing the
<B>mime.types</B>

file, if
<B>~/.mime-types</B>

does not exist.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>MAILCAPDIR</B></FONT>
<DD>
Directory containing the
<B>.mailcap</B>

file, if
<B>~/.mailcap</B>

does not exist.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>WWWBROWSER</B></FONT>
<DD>
The browser used to open URL's, if neither the
<B>-browser</B>

option nor the
<B>.wwwBrowser</B>

resource are set.  For more information on hyper-TeX support,
see the `Hypertext' node in the
<B>dvipsk</B>

manual.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>TMPDIR</B></FONT>

Determines the editor command used for source special `reverse
search', if neither the
<I>-editor</I>

command-line option
nor the
<I>.editor</I>

resource are  specified.   See  the description of the
<I>-editor</I>

command line option for details on the format.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>VISUAL</B></FONT>
<DD>
Determines an editor to be opened in an xterm
window if neither of
<I>-editor</I>,

<I>.editor</I>,

<I>XEDITOR</I>

is specified.
<DT><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>EDITOR</B></FONT>
<DD>
Determines an editor to be opened in an xterm

<I>-editor</I>,

<I>.editor</I>,

<I>XEDITOR</I>

or
<I>VISUAL</I>

is specified.

<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LIMITATIONS</H2>

<B>xdvi</B>

accepts many but not all types of PostScript specials accepted by
<B>dvips</B>.

For example, it accepts most specials generated by
<B>epsf</B>

and
<B>psfig</B>.

It does not, however, support
<B>bop-hook</B>

or
<B>eop-hook</B>,

nor does it allow PostScript commands to affect the rendering of things that
are not PostScript (for example, the ``NEAT'' and rotated ``A'' examples in the
<B>dvips</B>

manual).  These restrictions are due to the design of
<B>xdvi</B>;

in all likelihood they will always remain.
<P>

LaTeX2e color and rotation specials are not currently supported.
<P>

<B>MetaPost</B>

files containing included text are not supported.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<B>xdvi.cfg</B>

needs to be supplied in the directory named by the
<B>XDVIINPUTS kpathsea</B>

variable.  Please see the file
<B>README.t1fonts</B>

in the source distribution if 
<B>xdvi.cfg</B>

is missing.
<B>xdvik</B>

also relies on the whole
