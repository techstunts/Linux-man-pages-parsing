<I>Nmapfe</I>

(also known as xnmap) is a convenient X Window front end for the Nmap
Security Scanner.  Most of the options correspond directly to Nmap
options, which are described in detail in the Nmap man page.  We
recommend you read that first.  There is also limited help available
via the NmapFE &quot;Help&quot; menu.
