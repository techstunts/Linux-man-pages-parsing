<H2>NAME</H2>

perlfaq - frequently asked questions about Perl ($Date: 2003/01/31 17:37:17 $)
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
The perlfaq is divided into several documents based on topics.  A table
of contents is at the end of this document.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Where to get the perlfaq</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
Extracts of the perlfaq are posted regularly to
comp.lang.perl.misc.  It is available on many web sites:
<A HREF="http://www.perldoc.com/">http://www.perldoc.com/</A> and <A HREF="http://faq.perl.org/">http://faq.perl.org/</A>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>How to contribute to the perlfaq</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
You may mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
<A HREF="mailto:perlfaq-workers@perl.org">perlfaq-workers@perl.org</A> .  This alias should not be used to
<I>ask</I> FAQs.  It's for fixing the current <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT>. Send
questions to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.  You can
view the source tree at <A HREF="http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/perlfaq/">http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/perlfaq/</A>
(which is outside of the main Perl source tree).  The <FONT SIZE="-1">CVS</FONT>
repository notes all changes to the <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT>.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
Your questions will probably go unread, unless they're
suggestions of new questions to add to the <FONT SIZE="-1">FAQ</FONT>, in which
case they should have gone to the <A HREF="mailto:perlfaq-workers@perl.org">perlfaq-workers@perl.org</A>
instead.
<P>

You should have read section 2 of this faq.  There you would
have learned that comp.lang.perl.misc is the appropriate
place to go for free advice.  If your question is really
important and you require a prompt and correct answer, you
should hire a consultant.

The original perlfaq was written by Tom Christiansen, then expanded
by collaboration between Tom and Nathan Torkington.  The current
document is maintained by the perlfaq-workers (<A HREF="mailto:perlfaq-workers@perl.org">perlfaq-workers@perl.org</A>).
Several people have contributed answers, corrections, and comments.
