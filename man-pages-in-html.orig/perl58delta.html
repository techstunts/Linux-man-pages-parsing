<H2>NAME</H2>

perl58delta - what is new for perl v5.8.0
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
This document describes differences between the 5.6.0 release and
the 5.8.0 release.
<P>

Many of the bug fixes in 5.8.0 were already seen in the 5.6.1
maintenance release since the two releases were kept closely
coordinated (while 5.8.0 was still called 5.7.something).
<P>

Changes that were integrated into the 5.6.1 release are marked <TT>&quot;[561]&quot;</TT>.
Many of these changes have been further developed since 5.6.1 was released,
those are marked <TT>&quot;[561+]&quot;</TT>.
<P>

You can see the list of changes in the 5.6.1 release (both from the
5.005_03 release and the 5.6.0 release) by reading perl561delta.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Incompatible Changes</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Binary Incompatibility</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
<B>Perl 5.8 is not binary compatible with earlier releases of Perl.</B>
<P>

<B>You have to recompile your </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>XS</B></FONT><B> modules.</B>
<P>

(Pure Perl modules should continue to work.)
<P>

The major reason for the discontinuity is the new <FONT SIZE="-1">IO</FONT> architecture
called PerlIO.  PerlIO is the default configuration because without
it many new features of Perl 5.8 cannot be used.  In other words:
you just have to recompile your modules containing <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> code, sorry
about that.
<P>

In future releases of Perl, non-PerlIO aware <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> modules may become
completely unsupported.  This shouldn't be too difficult for module
authors, however: PerlIO has been designed as a drop-in replacement
(at the source code level) for the stdio interface.
<P>

Depending on your platform, there are also other reasons why
we decided to break binary compatibility, please read on.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>64-bit platforms and malloc</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
If your pointers are 64 bits wide, the Perl malloc is no longer being
used because it does not work well with 8-byte pointers.  Also,
usually the system mallocs on such platforms are much better optimized
for such large memory models than the Perl malloc.  Some memory-hungry
Perl applications like the <FONT SIZE="-1">PDL</FONT> don't work well with Perl's malloc.
Finally, other applications than Perl (such as mod_perl) tend to prefer
the system malloc.  Such platforms include Alpha and 64-bit <FONT SIZE="-1">HPPA</FONT>,
<FONT SIZE="-1">MIPS</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">PPC</FONT>, and Sparc.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2><FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> Dynaloading</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> dynaloading now uses in <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> releases 4.3 and newer the native
dlopen interface of <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> instead of the old emulated interface.  This
change will probably break backward compatibility with compiled
modules.  The change was made to make Perl more compliant with other
applications like mod_perl which are using the <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> native interface.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Attributes for my variables now handled at run-time</H2>



<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
The <TT>&quot;my EXPR : ATTRS&quot;</TT> syntax now applies variable attributes at
run-time.  (Subroutine and <TT>&quot;our&quot;</TT> variables still get attributes applied
at compile-time.)  See attributes for additional details.  In particular,
however, this allows variable attributes to be useful for <TT>&quot;tie&quot;</TT> interfaces,
which was a deficiency of earlier releases.  Note that the new semantics
doesn't work with the Attribute::Handlers module (as of version 0.76).
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Socket Extension Dynamic in <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS</FONT></H2>

<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
The Socket extension is now dynamically loaded instead of being
statically built in.  This may or may not be a problem with ancient
<FONT SIZE="-1">TCP/IP</FONT> stacks of <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS:</FONT> we do not know since we weren't able to test
Perl in such configurations.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>IEEE-format Floating Point Default on OpenVMS Alpha</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
Perl now uses <FONT SIZE="-1">IEEE</FONT> format (T_FLOAT) as the default internal floating
point format on OpenVMS Alpha, potentially breaking binary compatibility
with external libraries or existing data.  G_FLOAT is still available as
a configuration option.  The default on <FONT SIZE="-1">VAX</FONT> (D_FLOAT) has not changed.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>New Unicode Semantics (no more use utf8, almost)</H2>



<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
Previously in Perl 5.6 to use Unicode one would say ``use utf8'' and
then the operations (like string concatenation) were Unicode-aware
in that lexical scope.
<P>

This was found to be an inconvenient interface, and in Perl 5.8 the
Unicode model has completely changed: now the ``Unicodeness'' is bound
to the data itself, and for most of the time ``use utf8'' is not needed
at all.  The only remaining use of ``use utf8'' is when the Perl script
itself has been written in the <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> encoding of Unicode.  (<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> has
not been made the default since there are many Perl scripts out there
that are using various national eight-bit character sets, which would
be illegal in <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.)
<P>

See perluniintro for the explanation of the current model,
and utf8 for the current use of the utf8 pragma.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>New Unicode Properties</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
Unicode <I>scripts</I> are now supported. Scripts are similar to (and superior
to) Unicode <I>blocks</I>. The difference between scripts and blocks is that
scripts are the glyphs used by a language or a group of languages, while
the blocks are more artificial groupings of (mostly) 256 characters based
on the Unicode numbering.
<P>

In general, scripts are more inclusive, but not universally so. For
example, while the script <TT>&quot;Latin&quot;</TT> includes all the Latin characters and
their various diacritic-adorned versions, it does not include the various
punctuation or digits (since they are not solely <TT>&quot;Latin&quot;</TT>).
<P>

A number of other properties are now supported, including <TT>&quot;\p{L&amp;}&quot;</TT>,
<TT>&quot;\p{Any}&quot;</TT> <TT>&quot;\p{Assigned}&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;\p{Unassigned}&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;\p{Blank}&quot;</TT> [561] and
<TT>&quot;\p{SpacePerl}&quot;</TT> [561] (along with their <TT>&quot;\P{...}&quot;</TT> versions, of course).
See perlunicode for details, and more additions.
<P>

The <TT>&quot;In&quot;</TT> or <TT>&quot;Is&quot;</TT> prefix to names used with the <TT>&quot;\p{...}&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;\P{...}&quot;</TT>
are now almost always optional. The only exception is that a <TT>&quot;In&quot;</TT> prefix
is required to signify a Unicode block when a block name conflicts with a
script name. For example, <TT>&quot;\p{Tibetan}&quot;</TT> refers to the script, while
<TT>&quot;\p{InTibetan}&quot;</TT> refers to the block. When there is no name conflict, you
can omit the <TT>&quot;In&quot;</TT> from the block name (e.g. <TT>&quot;\p{BraillePatterns}&quot;</TT>), but
to be safe, it's probably best to always use the <TT>&quot;In&quot;</TT>).
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2><FONT SIZE="-1">REF</FONT>(...) Instead Of <FONT SIZE="-1">SCALAR</FONT>(...)

</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
A reference to a reference now stringifies as ``<FONT SIZE="-1">REF</FONT>(0x81485ec)'' instead
of ``<FONT SIZE="-1">SCALAR</FONT>(0x81485ec)'' in order to be more consistent with the return
value of <I>ref()</I>.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>pack/unpack D/F recycled</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
The undocumented pack/unpack template letters D/F have been recycled
for better use: now they stand for long double (if supported by the
platform) and <FONT SIZE="-1">NV</FONT> (Perl internal floating point type).  (They used
to be aliases for d/f, but you never knew that.)
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2><I>glob()</I> now returns filenames in alphabetical order</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
The list of filenames from <I>glob()</I> (or &lt;...&gt;) is now by default sorted
alphabetically to be csh-compliant (which is what happened before
in most <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> platforms).  (<I>bsd_glob()</I> does still sort platform
natively, <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> or <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT>, unless <FONT SIZE="-1">GLOB_ALPHASORT</FONT> is specified.) [561]
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Deprecations</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The semantics of bless(<FONT SIZE="-1">REF</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">REF</FONT>) were unclear and until someone proves
it to make some sense, it is forbidden.
<DT>*<DD>
The obsolete chat2 library that should never have been allowed
to escape the laboratory has been decommissioned.
<DT>*<DD>
Using chdir(&quot;&quot;) or chdir(undef) instead of explicit <I>chdir()</I> is
doubtful.  A failure (think chdir(<I>some_function()</I>) can lead into
unintended <I>chdir()</I> to the home directory, therefore this behaviour
is deprecated.
<DT>*<DD>
The builtin <I>dump()</I> function has probably outlived most of its
usefulness.  The core-dumping functionality will remain in future
available as an explicit call to <TT>&quot;CORE::dump()&quot;</TT>, but in future
releases the behaviour of an unqualified <TT>&quot;dump()&quot;</TT> call may change.
<DT>*<DD>
The very dusty examples in the eg/ directory have been removed.
Suggestions for new shiny examples welcome but the main issue is that
the examples need to be documented, tested and (most importantly)
maintained.
<DT>*<DD>
The (bogus) escape sequences \8 and \9 now give an optional warning
(``Unrecognized escape passed through'').  There is no need to \-escape
any <TT>&quot;\w&quot;</TT> character.
<DT>*<DD>
The *glob{<FONT SIZE="-1">FILEHANDLE</FONT>} is deprecated, use *glob{<FONT SIZE="-1">IO</FONT>} instead.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;package;&quot;</TT> syntax (<TT>&quot;package&quot;</TT> without an argument) has been
deprecated.  Its semantics were never that clear and its
implementation even less so.  If you have used that feature to
disallow all but fully qualified variables, <TT>&quot;use strict;&quot;</TT> instead.
<DT>*<DD>
The unimplemented <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> regex features [[.cc.]] and [[=c=]] are still
recognised but now cause fatal errors.  The previous behaviour of
ignoring them by default and warning if requested was unacceptable
since it, in a way, falsely promised that the features could be used.
<DT>*<DD>
In future releases, non-PerlIO aware <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> modules may become completely
unsupported.  Since PerlIO is a drop-in replacement for stdio at the
source code level, this shouldn't be that drastic a change.
<DT>*<DD>
Previous versions of perl and some readings of some sections of Camel
<FONT SIZE="-1">III</FONT> implied that the <TT>&quot;:raw&quot;</TT> ``discipline'' was the inverse of <TT>&quot;:crlf&quot;</TT>.
Turning off ``clrfness'' is no longer enough to make a stream truly
binary. So the PerlIO <TT>&quot;:raw&quot;</TT> layer (or ``discipline'', to use the Camel
book's older terminology) is now formally defined as being equivalent
to binmode(<FONT SIZE="-1">FH</FONT>) - which is in turn defined as doing whatever is
necessary to pass each byte as-is without any translation.  In
particular binmode(<FONT SIZE="-1">FH</FONT>) - and hence <TT>&quot;:raw&quot;</TT> - will now turn off both
<FONT SIZE="-1">CRLF</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> translation and remove other layers (e.g. :<I>encoding()</I>)
which would modify byte stream.
<DT>*<DD>
The current user-visible implementation of pseudo-hashes (the weird
use of the first array element) is deprecated starting from Perl 5.8.0
and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, and the feature will be
implemented differently.  Not only is the current interface rather
ugly, but the current implementation slows down normal array and hash
use quite noticeably. The <TT>&quot;fields&quot;</TT> pragma interface will remain
available.  The <I>restricted hashes</I> interface is expected to
be the replacement interface (see Hash::Util).  If your existing
programs depends on the underlying implementation, consider using
Class::PseudoHash from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.
<DT>*<DD>
The syntaxes <TT>&quot;@a-&gt;[...]&quot;</TT> and  <TT>&quot;%h-&gt;{...}&quot;</TT> have now been deprecated.
<DT>*<DD>
After years of trying, suidperl is considered to be too complex to
ever be considered truly secure.  The suidperl functionality is likely
to be removed in a future release.
<DT>*<DD>
The 5.005 threads model (module <TT>&quot;Thread&quot;</TT>) is deprecated and expected
to be removed in Perl 5.10.  Multithreaded code should be migrated to
the new ithreads model (see threads, threads::shared and
perlthrtut).
<DT>*<DD>
The long deprecated uppercase aliases for the string comparison
operators (<FONT SIZE="-1">EQ</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">NE</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">LT</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">LE</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GE</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GT</FONT>) have now been removed.
<DT>*<DD>
The tr///C and tr///U features have been removed and will not return;
the interface was a mistake.  Sorry about that.  For similar
functionality, see pack('U0', ...) and pack('C0', ...). [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Earlier Perls treated ``sub foo (@bar)'' as equivalent to ``sub foo (@)''.
The prototypes are now checked better at compile-time for invalid
syntax.  An optional warning is generated (``Illegal character in
prototype...'')  but this may be upgraded to a fatal error in a future
release.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;exec LIST&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;system LIST&quot;</TT> operations now produce warnings on
tainted data and in some future release they will produce fatal errors.
<DT>*<DD>
The existing behaviour when localising tied arrays and hashes is wrong,
and will be changed in a future release, so do not rely on the existing
behaviour. See ``Localising Tied Arrays and Hashes Is Broken''.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Core Enhancements</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Unicode Overhaul</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
Unicode in general should be now much more usable than in Perl 5.6.0
(or even in 5.6.1).  Unicode can be used in hash keys, Unicode in
regular expressions should work now, Unicode in tr/// should work now,
Unicode in I/O should work now.  See perluniintro for introduction
and perlunicode for details.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The Unicode Character Database coming with Perl has been upgraded
to Unicode 3.2.0.  For more information, see <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/">http://www.unicode.org/</A> .
[561+] (5.6.1 has <FONT SIZE="-1">UCD</FONT> 3.0.1.)
<DT>*<DD>
For developers interested in enhancing Perl's Unicode capabilities:
almost all the <FONT SIZE="-1">UCD</FONT> files are included with the Perl distribution in
the <I>lib/unicore</I> subdirectory.  The most notable omission, for space
considerations, is the Unihan database.
<DT>*<DD>
The properties \p{Blank} and \p{SpacePerl} have been added. ``Blank'' is like
C <I>isblank()</I>, that is, it contains only ``horizontal whitespace'' (the space
character is, the newline isn't), and the ``SpacePerl'' is the Unicode
equivalent of <TT>&quot;\s&quot;</TT> (\p{Space} isn't, since that includes the vertical
tabulator character, whereas <TT>&quot;\s&quot;</TT> doesn't.)


<P>


See ``New Unicode Properties'' earlier in this document for additional
information on changes with Unicode properties.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PerlIO is Now The Default</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">IO</FONT> is now by default done via PerlIO rather than system's ``stdio''.
PerlIO allows ``layers'' to be ``pushed'' onto a file handle to alter the
handle's behaviour.  Layers can be specified at open time via 3-arg
form of open:


<P>




<PRE>
   open($fh,'&gt;:crlf :utf8', $path) || ...

</PRE>




<P>


or on already opened handles via extended <TT>&quot;binmode&quot;</TT>:


<P>




<PRE>
   binmode($fh,':encoding(iso-8859-7)');

</PRE>




<P>


The built-in layers are: unix (low level read/write), stdio (as in
previous Perls), perlio (re-implementation of stdio buffering in a
portable manner), crlf (does <FONT SIZE="-1">CRLF</FONT> &lt;=&gt; ``\n'' translation as on Win32,
but available on any platform).  A mmap layer may be available if
platform supports it (mostly UNIXes).


<P>


Layers to be applied by default may be specified via the 'open' pragma.


<P>


See ``Installation and Configuration Improvements'' for the effects
of PerlIO on your architecture name.
<DT>*<DD>
If your platform supports <I>fork()</I>, you can use the list form of <TT>&quot;open&quot;</TT>
for pipes.  For example:


<P>




<PRE>
    open KID_PS, &quot;-|&quot;, &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;aux&quot; or die $!;

</PRE>




<P>


forks the <I><A HREF="../man1/ps.1.php">ps</A></I>(1) command (without spawning a shell, as there are more
than three arguments to <I>open()</I>), and reads its standard output via the
<TT>&quot;KID_PS&quot;</TT> filehandle.  See perlipc.
<DT>*<DD>
File handles can be marked as accepting Perl's internal encoding of Unicode
(<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> or UTF-EBCDIC depending on platform) by a pseudo layer ``:utf8'' :


<P>




<PRE>
   open($fh,&quot;&gt;:utf8&quot;,&quot;Uni.txt&quot;);

</PRE>




<P>


Note for <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT> users: the pseudo layer ``:utf8'' is erroneously named
for you since it's not <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> what you will be getting but instead
<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-EBCDIC</FONT>.  See perlunicode, utf8, and
<A HREF="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr16/">http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr16/</A> for more information.
In future releases this naming may change.  See perluniintro
for more information about <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.
<DT>*<DD>
If your environment variables (<FONT SIZE="-1">LC_ALL</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">LC_CTYPE</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">LANG</FONT>) look like you
want to use <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> (any of the the variables match <TT>&quot;/utf-?8/i&quot;</TT>), your
<FONT SIZE="-1">STDIN</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">STDOUT</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT> handles and the default open layer (see open)
are marked as <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.  (This feature, like other new features that
combine Unicode and I/O, work only if you are using PerlIO, but that's
the default.)


<P>


Note that after this Perl really does assume that everything is <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8:</FONT>
for example if some input handle is not, Perl will probably very soon
complain about the input data like this ``Malformed <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT> ...'' since
any old eight-bit data is not legal <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.


<P>


Note for code authors: if you want to enable your users to use <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>
as their default encoding  but in your code still have eight-bit I/O streams
(such as images or zip files), you need to explicitly <I>open()</I> or <I>binmode()</I>
with <TT>&quot;:bytes&quot;</TT> (see ``open'' in perlfunc and ``binmode'' in perlfunc), or you
can just use <TT>&quot;binmode(FH)&quot;</TT> (nice for pre-5.8.0 backward compatibility).
<DT>*<DD>
File handles can translate character encodings from/to Perl's internal
Unicode form on read/write via the ``:<I>encoding()</I>'' layer.
<DT>*<DD>
File handles can be opened to ``in memory'' files held in Perl scalars via:


<P>




<PRE>
   open($fh,'&gt;', \$variable) || ...

</PRE>


<DT>*<DD>
Anonymous temporary files are available without need to
'use FileHandle' or other module via


<P>




<PRE>
   open($fh,&quot;+&gt;&quot;, undef) || ...

</PRE>




<P>


That is a literal undef, not an undefined value.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ithreads</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
The new interpreter threads (``ithreads'' for short) implementation of
multithreading, by Arthur Bergman, replaces the old ``5.005 threads''
implementation.  In the ithreads model any data sharing between
threads must be explicit, as opposed to the model where data sharing
was implicit.  See threads and threads::shared, and
perlthrtut.
<P>

As a part of the ithreads implementation Perl will also use
any necessary and detectable reentrant libc interfaces.
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Restricted Hashes</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAV"></A>
A restricted hash is restricted to a certain set of keys, no keys
outside the set can be added.  Also individual keys can be restricted
so that the key cannot be deleted and the value cannot be changed.
No new syntax is involved: the Hash::Util module is the interface.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Safe Signals</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
Perl used to be fragile in that signals arriving at inopportune moments
could corrupt Perl's internal state.  Now Perl postpones handling of
signals until it's safe (between opcodes).
<P>

This change may have surprising side effects because signals no longer
interrupt Perl instantly.  Perl will now first finish whatever it was
doing, like finishing an internal operation (like <I>sort()</I>) or an
external operation (like an I/O operation), and only then look at any
arrived signals (and before starting the next operation).  No more corrupt
internal state since the current operation is always finished first,
but the signal may take more time to get heard.  Note that breaking
out from potentially blocking operations should still work, though.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Understanding of Numbers</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAX"></A>
In general a lot of fixing has happened in the area of Perl's
understanding of numbers, both integer and floating point.  Since in
many systems the standard number parsing functions like <TT>&quot;strtoul()&quot;</TT>
and <TT>&quot;atof()&quot;</TT> seem to have bugs, Perl tries to work around their
deficiencies.  This results hopefully in more accurate numbers.
<P>

Perl now tries internally to use integer values in numeric conversions
and basic arithmetics (+ - * /) if the arguments are integers, and
tries also to keep the results stored internally as integers.
This change leads to often slightly faster and always less lossy
arithmetics. (Previously Perl always preferred floating point numbers
in its math.)
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Arrays now always interpolate into double-quoted strings [561]</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAY"></A>
In double-quoted strings, arrays now interpolate, no matter what.  The
behavior in earlier versions of perl 5 was that arrays would interpolate
into strings if the array had been mentioned before the string was
compiled, and otherwise Perl would raise a fatal compile-time error.
In versions 5.000 through 5.003, the error was
<P>



<PRE>
        Literal @example now requires backslash

</PRE>


<P>

In versions 5.004_01 through 5.6.0, the error was
<P>



<PRE>
        In string, @example now must be written as \@example

</PRE>


<P>

The idea here was to get people into the habit of writing
<TT>&quot;fred\@example.com&quot;</TT> when they wanted a literal <TT>&quot;@&quot;</TT> sign, just as
they have always written <TT>&quot;Give me back my \$5&quot;</TT> when they wanted a
literal <TT>&quot;$&quot;</TT> sign.
<P>

Starting with 5.6.1, when Perl now sees an <TT>&quot;@&quot;</TT> sign in a
double-quoted string, it <I>always</I> attempts to interpolate an array,
regardless of whether or not the array has been used or declared
already.  The fatal error has been downgraded to an optional warning:
<P>



<PRE>
        Possible unintended interpolation of @example in string

</PRE>


<P>

This warns you that <TT>&quot;<A HREF="mailto:fred@example.com">fred@example.com</A>&quot;</TT> is going to turn into
<TT>&quot;fred.com&quot;</TT> if you don't backslash the <TT>&quot;@&quot;</TT>.
See <A HREF="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/at-error.php">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/at-error.html</A> for more details
about the history here.

<H2>Miscellaneous Changes</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAZ"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> is now lvaluable, meaning that you can add the :lvalue attribute
to <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> subroutines and you can assign to the <FONT SIZE="-1">AUTOLOAD</FONT> return value.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>$Config</TT>{byteorder} (and corresponding <FONT SIZE="-1">BYTEORDER</FONT> in config.h) was
previously wrong in platforms if sizeof(long) was 4, but sizeof(<FONT SIZE="-1">IV</FONT>)
was 8.  The byteorder was only sizeof(long) bytes long (1234 or 4321),
but now it is correctly sizeof(<FONT SIZE="-1">IV</FONT>) bytes long, (12345678 or 87654321).
(This problem didn't affect Windows platforms.)


<P>


Also, <TT>$Config</TT>{byteorder} is now computed dynamically---this is more
robust with ``fat binaries'' where an executable image contains binaries
for more than one binary platform, and when cross-compiling.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;perl -d:Module=arg,arg,arg&quot;</TT> now works (previously one couldn't pass
in multiple arguments.)
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;do&quot;</TT> followed by a bareword now ensures that this bareword isn't
a keyword (to avoid a bug where <TT>&quot;do q(foo.pl)&quot;</TT> tried to call a
subroutine called <TT>&quot;q&quot;</TT>).  This means that for example instead of
<TT>&quot;do format()&quot;</TT> you must write <TT>&quot;do &amp;format()&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
The builtin <I>dump()</I> now gives an optional warning
<TT>&quot;dump() better written as CORE::dump()&quot;</TT>,
meaning that by default <TT>&quot;dump(...)&quot;</TT> is resolved as the builtin
<I>dump()</I> which dumps core and aborts, not as (possibly) user-defined
<TT>&quot;sub dump&quot;</TT>.  To call the latter, qualify the call as <TT>&quot;&amp;dump(...)&quot;</TT>.
(The whole <I>dump()</I> feature is to considered deprecated, and possibly
removed/changed in future releases.)
<DT>*<DD>
<I>chomp()</I> and <I>chop()</I> are now overridable.  Note, however, that their
prototype (as given by <TT>&quot;prototype(&quot;CORE::chomp&quot;)&quot;</TT> is undefined,
because it cannot be expressed and therefore one cannot really write
replacements to override these builtins.
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> blocks are now run even if you exit/die in a <FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN</FONT> block.
Internally, the execution of <FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT> blocks is now controlled by
PL_exit_flags &amp; <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END</FONT>. This enables the new
behaviour for Perl embedders. This will default in 5.10. See
perlembed.
<DT>*<DD>
Formats now support zero-padded decimal fields.
<DT>*<DD>
Although ``you shouldn't do that'', it was possible to write code that
depends on Perl's hashed key order (Data::Dumper does this).  The new
algorithm ``One-at-a-Time'' produces a different hashed key order.
More details are in ``Performance Enhancements''.
<DT>*<DD>
lstat(<FONT SIZE="-1">FILEHANDLE</FONT>) now gives a warning because the operation makes no sense.
In future releases this may become a fatal error.
<DT>*<DD>
Spurious syntax errors generated in certain situations, when <I>glob()</I>
caused File::Glob to be loaded for the first time, have been fixed. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Lvalue subroutines can now return <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> in list context.  However,
the lvalue subroutine feature still remains experimental.  [561+]
<DT>*<DD>
A lost warning ``Can't declare ... dereference in my'' has been
restored (Perl had it earlier but it became lost in later releases.)
<DT>*<DD>
A new special regular expression variable has been introduced:
<TT>$^N</TT>, which contains the most-recently closed group (submatch).
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;no Module;&quot;</TT> does not produce an error even if Module does not have an
<I>unimport()</I> method.  This parallels the behavior of <TT>&quot;use&quot;</TT> vis-a-vis
<TT>&quot;import&quot;</TT>. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
The numerical comparison operators return <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> if either operand
is a NaN.  Previously the behaviour was unspecified.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;our&quot;</TT> can now have an experimental optional attribute <TT>&quot;unique&quot;</TT> that
affects how global variables are shared among multiple interpreters,
see ``our'' in perlfunc.
<DT>*<DD>
The following builtin functions are now overridable: <I>each()</I>, <I>keys()</I>,
<I>pop()</I>, <I>push()</I>, <I>shift()</I>, <I>splice()</I>, <I>unshift()</I>. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;pack() / unpack()&quot;</TT> can now group template letters with <TT>&quot;()&quot;</TT> and then
apply repetition/count modifiers on the groups.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;pack() / unpack()&quot;</TT> can now process the Perl internal numeric types:
IVs, UVs, NVs--- and also long doubles, if supported by the platform.
The template letters are <TT>&quot;j&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;J&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;F&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;D&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;pack('U0a*', ...)&quot;</TT> can now be used to force a string to <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.
<DT>*<DD>
my __PACKAGE__ <TT>$obj</TT> now works. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<I>POSIX::sleep()</I> now returns the number of <I>unslept</I> seconds
(as the <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> standard says), as opposed to <I>CORE::sleep()</I> which
returns the number of slept seconds.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>printf()</I> and <I>sprintf()</I> now support parameter reordering using the
<TT>&quot;%\d+\$&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;*\d+\$&quot;</TT> syntaxes.  For example


<P>




<PRE>
    printf &quot;%2\$s %1\$s\n&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;;

</PRE>




<P>


will print ``bar foo\n''.  This feature helps in writing
internationalised software, and in general when the order
of the parameters can vary.
<DT>*<DD>
The (\&amp;) prototype now works properly. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
prototype(\[$@%&amp;]) is now available to implicitly create references
(useful for example if you want to emulate the <I>tie()</I> interface).
<DT>*<DD>
A new command-line option, <TT>&quot;-t&quot;</TT> is available.  It is the
little brother of <TT>&quot;-T&quot;</TT>: instead of dying on taint violations,
lexical warnings are given.  <B>This is only meant as a temporary
debugging aid while securing the code of old legacy applications.
This is not a substitute for -T.</B>
<DT>*<DD>
In other taint news, the <TT>&quot;exec LIST&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;system LIST&quot;</TT> have now been
considered too risky (think <TT>&quot;exec @ARGV&quot;</TT>: it can start any program
with any arguments), and now the said forms cause a warning under
lexical warnings.  You should carefully launder the arguments to
guarantee their validity.  In future releases of Perl the forms will
become fatal errors so consider starting laundering now.
<DT>*<DD>
Tied hash interfaces are now required to have the <FONT SIZE="-1">EXISTS</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">DELETE</FONT>
methods (either own or inherited).
<DT>*<DD>
If tr/// is just counting characters, it doesn't attempt to
modify its target.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>untie()</I> will now call an <FONT SIZE="-1"><I>UNTIE</I></FONT><I>()</I> hook if it exists.  See perltie
for details. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
utime now supports <TT>&quot;utime undef, undef, @files&quot;</TT> to change the
file timestamps to the current time.
<DT>*<DD>
The rules for allowing underscores (underbars) in numeric constants
have been relaxed and simplified: now you can have an underscore
simply <B>between digits</B>.
<DT>*<DD>
Rather than relying on C's argv[0] (which may not contain a full pathname)
where possible $^X is now set by asking the operating system.
(eg by reading <I>/proc/self/exe</I> on Linux, <I>/proc/curproc/file</I> on FreeBSD)
<DT>*<DD>
A new variable, <TT>&quot;${^TAINT}&quot;</TT>, indicates whether taint mode is enabled.
<DT>*<DD>
You can now override the <I>readline()</I> builtin, and this overrides also
the &lt;<FONT SIZE="-1">FILEHANDLE</FONT>&gt; angle bracket operator.
<DT>*<DD>
The command-line options -s and -F are now recognized on the shebang
(#!) line.
<DT>*<DD>
Use of the <TT>&quot;/c&quot;</TT> match modifier without an accompanying <TT>&quot;/g&quot;</TT> modifier
elicits a new warning: <TT>&quot;Use of /c modifier is meaningless without /g&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Use of <TT>&quot;/c&quot;</TT> in substitutions, even with <TT>&quot;/g&quot;</TT>, elicits
<TT>&quot;Use of /c modifier is meaningless in s///&quot;</TT>.


<P>


Use of <TT>&quot;/g&quot;</TT> with <TT>&quot;split&quot;</TT> elicits <TT>&quot;Use of /g modifier is meaningless
in split&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
Support for the <TT>&quot;CLONE&quot;</TT> special subroutine had been added.
With ithreads, when a new thread is created, all Perl data is cloned,
however non-Perl data cannot be cloned automatically.  In <TT>&quot;CLONE&quot;</TT> you
can do whatever you need to do, like for example handle the cloning of
non-Perl data, if necessary.  <TT>&quot;CLONE&quot;</TT> will be executed once for every
package that has it defined or inherited.  It will be called in the
context of the new thread, so all modifications are made in the new area.

<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Attribute::Handlers&quot;</TT>, originally by Damian Conway and now maintained
by Arthur Bergman, allows a class to define attribute handlers.


<P>




<PRE>
    package MyPack;
    use Attribute::Handlers;
    sub Wolf :ATTR(SCALAR) { print &quot;howl!\n&quot; }

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
    # later, in some package using or inheriting from MyPack...

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
    my MyPack $Fluffy : Wolf; # the attribute handler Wolf will be called

</PRE>




<P>


Both variables and routines can have attribute handlers.  Handlers can
be specific to type (<FONT SIZE="-1">SCALAR</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">ARRAY</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">HASH</FONT>, or <FONT SIZE="-1">CODE</FONT>), or specific to the
exact compilation phase (<FONT SIZE="-1">BEGIN</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">CHECK</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">INIT</FONT>, or <FONT SIZE="-1">END</FONT>).
See Attribute::Handlers.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;B::Concise&quot;</TT>, by Stephen McCamant, is a new compiler backend for
walking the Perl syntax tree, printing concise info about ops.
The output is highly customisable.  See B::Concise. [561+]
<DT>*<DD>
The new bignum, bigint, and bigrat pragmas, by Tels, implement
transparent bignum support (using the Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat,
and Math::BigRat backends).
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Class::ISA&quot;</TT>, by Sean Burke, is a module for reporting the search
path for a class's <FONT SIZE="-1">ISA</FONT> tree.  See Class::ISA.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Cwd&quot;</TT> now has a split personality: if possible, an <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> extension is
used, (this will hopefully be faster, more secure, and more robust)
but if not possible, the familiar Perl implementation is used.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Devel::PPPort&quot;</TT>, originally by Kenneth Albanowski and now
maintained by Paul Marquess, has been added.  It is primarily used
by <TT>&quot;h2xs&quot;</TT> to enhance portability of <FONT SIZE="-1">XS</FONT> modules between different
versions of Perl.  See Devel::PPPort.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Digest&quot;</TT>, frontend module for calculating digests (checksums), from
Gisle Aas, has been added.  See Digest.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Digest::MD5&quot;</TT> for calculating <FONT SIZE="-1">MD5</FONT> digests (checksums) as defined in
<FONT SIZE="-1">RFC</FONT> 1321, from Gisle Aas, has been added.  See Digest::MD5.


<P>




<PRE>
    use Digest::MD5 'md5_hex';

</PRE>




<P>




<PRE>
    $digest = md5_hex(&quot;Thirsty Camel&quot;);

<P>


<FONT SIZE="-1">NOTE:</FONT> the <TT>&quot;MD5&quot;</TT> backward compatibility module is deliberately not
included since its further use is discouraged.


<P>


See also PerlIO::via::QuotedPrint.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Encode&quot;</TT>, originally by Nick Ing-Simmons and now maintained by Dan
Kogai, provides a mechanism to translate between different character
encodings.  Support for Unicode, <FONT SIZE="-1">ISO-8859-1</FONT>, and <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> are compiled in
to the module.  Several other encodings (like the rest of the
<FONT SIZE="-1">ISO-8859</FONT>, CP*/Win*, Mac, <FONT SIZE="-1">KOI8-R</FONT>, three variants <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT>, Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean encodings) are included and can be loaded at
runtime.  (For space considerations, the largest Chinese encodings
have been separated into their own <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> module, Encode::HanExtra,
which Encode will use if available).  See Encode.


<P>


Any encoding supported by Encode module is also available to the
``:<I>encoding()</I>'' layer if PerlIO is used.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;Hash::Util&quot;</TT> is the interface to the new <I>restricted hashes</I>
feature.  (Implemented by Jeffrey Friedl, Nick Ing-Simmons, and
Michael Schwern.)  See Hash::Util.

<H2>Updated And Improved Modules and Pragmata</H2>

<A NAME="ixABC"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The following independently supported modules have been updated to the
newest versions from <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN:</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">CGI</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>, DB_File, File::Spec, File::Temp,
Getopt::Long, Math::BigFloat, Math::BigInt, the podlators bundle
(Pod::Man, Pod::Text), Pod::LaTeX [561+], Pod::Parser, Storable,
Term::ANSIColor, Test, Text-Tabs+Wrap.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>attributes::reftype()</I> now works on tied arguments.
<DT>*<DD>
AutoLoader can now be disabled with <TT>&quot;no AutoLoader;&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
B::Deparse has been significantly enhanced by Robin Houston.  It can
now deparse almost all of the standard test suite (so that the tests
still succeed).  There is a make target ``test.deparse'' for trying this
out.
<DT>*<DD>
Carp now has better interface documentation, and the <TT>@CARP_NOT</TT>
interface has been added to get optional control over where errors
are reported independently of <TT>@ISA</TT>, by Ben Tilly.
<DT>*<DD>
Class::Struct can now define the classes in compile time.
<DT>*<DD>
Class::Struct now assigns the array/hash element if the accessor
is called with an array/hash element as the <B>sole</B> argument.
<DT>*<DD>
The return value of <I>Cwd::fastcwd()</I> is now tainted.
<DT>*<DD>
Data::Dumper now has an option to sort hashes.
<DT>*<DD>
Data::Dumper now has an option to dump code references
using B::Deparse.
<DT>*<DD>
DB_File now supports newer Berkeley <FONT SIZE="-1">DB</FONT> versions, among
other improvements.
<DT>*<DD>
Devel::Peek now has an interface for the Perl memory statistics
(this works only if you are using perl's malloc, and if you have
compiled with debugging).
<DT>*<DD>
The English module can now be used without the infamous performance
hit by saying


<P>




<PRE>
        use English '-no_match_vars';

</PRE>




<P>


(Assuming, of course, that you don't need the troublesome variables
<TT>$`</TT>, <TT>$&amp;</TT>, or <TT>$'</TT>.)  Also, introduced <TT>@LAST_MATCH_START</TT> and
<TT>@LAST_MATCH_END</TT> English aliases for <TT>&quot;@-&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;@+&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
ExtUtils::MakeMaker has been significantly cleaned up and fixed.
The enhanced version has also been backported to earlier releases
of Perl and submitted to <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> so that the earlier releases can
enjoy the fixes.
<DT>*<DD>
The arguments of <I>WriteMakefile()</I> in Makefile.PL are now checked
for sanity much more carefully than before.  This may cause new
warnings when modules are being installed.  See ExtUtils::MakeMaker
for more details.
<DT>*<DD>
ExtUtils::MakeMaker now uses File::Spec internally, which hopefully
leads to better portability.
<DT>*<DD>
Fcntl, Socket, and Sys::Syslog have been rewritten by Nicholas Clark
to use the new-style constant dispatch section (see ExtUtils::Constant).
This means that they will be more robust and hopefully faster.
<DT>*<DD>
File::Find now <I>chdir()</I>s correctly when chasing symbolic links. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
File::Find now has pre- and post-processing callbacks.  It also
correctly changes directories when chasing symbolic links.  Callbacks
(naughtily) exiting with ``next;'' instead of ``return;'' now work.
<DT>*<DD>
File::Find is now (again) reentrant.  It also has been made
more portable.
<DT>*<DD>
The warnings issued by File::Find now belong to their own category.
You can enable/disable them with <TT>&quot;use/no warnings 'File::Find';&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>File::Glob::glob()</I> has been renamed to <I>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</I>
because the name clashes with the builtin <I>glob()</I>.  The older
name is still available for compatibility, but is deprecated. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
File::Glob now supports <TT>&quot;GLOB_LIMIT&quot;</TT> constant to limit the size of
the returned list of filenames.
<DT>*<DD>
IPC::Open3 now allows the use of numeric file descriptors.
<DT>*<DD>
IO::Socket now has an <I>atmark()</I> method, which returns true if the socket
is positioned at the out-of-band mark.  The method is also exportable
as a <I>sockatmark()</I> function.
<DT>*<DD>
IO::Socket::INET failed to open the specified port if the service name
was not known.  It now correctly uses the supplied port number as is. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
IO::Socket::INET has support for the ReusePort option (if your
platform supports it).  The Reuse option now has an alias, ReuseAddr.
For clarity, you may want to prefer ReuseAddr.
<DT>*<DD>
IO::Socket::INET now supports a value of zero for <TT>&quot;LocalPort&quot;</TT>
(usually meaning that the operating system will make one up.)
<DT>*<DD>
'use lib' now works identically to <TT>@INC</TT>.  Removing directories
with 'no lib' now works.
<DT>*<DD>
Math::BigFloat and Math::BigInt have undergone a full rewrite by Tels.
They are now magnitudes faster, and they support various bignum
libraries such as <FONT SIZE="-1">GMP</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">PARI</FONT> as their backends.
<DT>*<DD>
Math::Complex handles inf, NaN etc., better.
<DT>*<DD>
Net::Ping has been considerably enhanced by Rob Brown: multihoming is
now supported, Win32 functionality is better, there is now time
measuring functionality (optionally high-resolution using
Time::HiRes), and there is now ``external'' protocol which uses
Net::Ping::External module which runs your external ping utility and
parses the output.  A version of Net::Ping::External is available in
<FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>.


<P>


Note that some of the Net::Ping tests are disabled when running
under the Perl distribution since one cannot assume one or more
of the following: enabled echo port at localhost, full Internet
connectivity, or sympathetic firewalls.  You can set the environment
variable PERL_TEST_Net_Ping to ``1'' (one) before running the Perl test
suite to enable all the Net::Ping tests.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>POSIX::sigaction()</I> is now much more flexible and robust.
You can now install coderef handlers, '<FONT SIZE="-1">DEFAULT</FONT>', and '<FONT SIZE="-1">IGNORE</FONT>'
handlers, installing new handlers was not atomic.
<DT>*<DD>
In Safe, <TT>%INC</TT> is now localised in a Safe compartment so that
use/require work.
<DT>*<DD>
In SDBM_File on dosish platforms, some keys went missing because of
lack of support for files with ``holes''.  A workaround for the problem
has been added.
<DT>*<DD>
In Search::Dict one can now have a pre-processing hook for the
lines being searched.
<DT>*<DD>
The Shell module now has an <FONT SIZE="-1">OO</FONT> interface.
<DT>*<DD>
In Sys::Syslog there is now a failover mechanism that will go
through alternative connection mechanisms until the message
is successfully logged.
<DT>*<DD>
The Test module has been significantly enhanced.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>Time::Local::timelocal()</I> does not handle fractional seconds anymore.
The rationale is that neither does <I>localtime()</I>, and <I>timelocal()</I> and
<I>localtime()</I> are supposed to be inverses of each other.
<DT>*<DD>
The vars pragma now supports declaring fully qualified variables.
(Something that <TT>&quot;our()&quot;</TT> does not and will not support.)
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;utf8::&quot;</TT> name space (as in the pragma) provides various
Perl-callable functions to provide low level access to Perl's
internal Unicode representation.  At the moment only <I>length()</I>
has been implemented.

<TT>&quot;enc2xs&quot;</TT> is a tool for people adding their own encodings to the

<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;h2ph&quot;</TT> now supports C trigraphs.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;h2xs&quot;</TT> now produces a template <FONT SIZE="-1">README</FONT>.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;h2xs&quot;</TT> now uses <TT>&quot;Devel::PPPort&quot;</TT> for better portability between
different versions of Perl.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;h2xs&quot;</TT> uses the new ExtUtils::Constant module
which will affect newly created extensions that define constants.
Since the new code is more correct (if you have two constants where the
first one is a prefix of the second one, the first constant <B>never</B>
got defined), less lossy (it uses integers for integer constant,
as opposed to the old code that used floating point numbers even for
integer constants), and slightly faster, you might want to consider
regenerating your extension code (the new scheme makes regenerating
easy).  h2xs now also supports C trigraphs.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;libnetcfg&quot;</TT> has been added to configure libnet.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;perlbug&quot;</TT> is now much more robust.  It also sends the bug report to
perl.org, not perl.com.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;perlcc&quot;</TT> has been rewritten and its user interface (that is,
command line) is much more like that of the <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> C compiler, cc.

<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;pod2html&quot;</TT> now produces <FONT SIZE="-1">XHTML</FONT> 1.0.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;pod2html&quot;</TT> now understands <FONT SIZE="-1">POD</FONT> written using different line endings
(PC-like <FONT SIZE="-1">CRLF</FONT> versus UNIX-like <FONT SIZE="-1">LF</FONT> versus MacClassic-like <FONT SIZE="-1">CR</FONT>).
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;s2p&quot;</TT> has been completely rewritten in Perl.  (It is in fact a full
implementation of sed in Perl: you can use the sed functionality by
using the <TT>&quot;psed&quot;</TT> utility.)
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;xsubpp&quot;</TT> now understands <FONT SIZE="-1">POD</FONT> documentation embedded in the *.xs

<H2>Performance Enhancements</H2>

<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<I>map()</I> could get pathologically slow when the result list it generates
is larger than the source list.  The performance has been improved for
common scenarios. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<I>sort()</I> is also fully reentrant, in the sense that the sort function
can itself call <I>sort()</I>.  This did not work reliably in previous
releases. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<I>sort()</I> has been changed to use primarily mergesort internally as
opposed to the earlier quicksort.  For very small lists this may
result in slightly slower sorting times, but in general the speedup
should be at least 20%.  Additional bonuses are that the worst case
behaviour of <I>sort()</I> is now better (in computer science terms it now
runs in time O(N log N), as opposed to quicksort's Theta(N**2)
worst-case run time behaviour), and that <I>sort()</I> is now stable
(meaning that elements with identical keys will stay ordered as they
were before the sort).  See the <TT>&quot;sort&quot;</TT> pragma for information.


<P>


The story in more detail: suppose you want to serve yourself a little
slice of Pi.


<P>




<PRE>
    @digits = ( 3,1,4,1,5,9 );

</PRE>




<P>


A numerical sort of the digits will yield (1,1,3,4,5,9), as expected.
Which <TT>1</TT> comes first is hard to know, since one <TT>1</TT> looks pretty
much like any other.  You can regard this as totally trivial,
or somewhat profound.  However, if you just want to sort the even
digits ahead of the odd ones, then what will


<P>




<PRE>
    sort { ($a % 2) &lt;=&gt; ($b % 2) } @digits;

</PRE>




<P>


yield?  The only even digit, <TT>4</TT>, will come first.  But how about
the odd numbers, which all compare equal?  With the quicksort algorithm
used to implement Perl 5.6 and earlier, the order of ties is left up
to the sort.  So, as you add more and more digits of Pi, the order
in which the sorted even and odd digits appear will change.
and, for sufficiently large slices of Pi, the quicksort algorithm
in Perl 5.8 won't return the same results even if reinvoked with the
same input.  The justification for this rests with quicksort's
worst case behavior.  If you run


<P>




<PRE>
   sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } ( 1 .. $N , 1 .. $N );

</PRE>




<P>


(something you might approximate if you wanted to merge two sorted
arrays using sort), doubling <TT>$N</TT> doesn't just double the quicksort time,
it <I>quadruples</I> it.  Quicksort has a worst case run time that can
grow like N**2, so-called <I>quadratic</I> behaviour, and it can happen
on patterns that may well arise in normal use.  You won't notice this
for small arrays, but you <I>will</I> notice it with larger arrays,
and you may not live long enough for the sort to complete on arrays
of a million elements.  So the 5.8 quicksort scrambles large arrays
before sorting them, as a statistical defence against quadratic behaviour.
But that means if you sort the same large array twice, ties may be
broken in different ways.


<P>


Because of the unpredictability of tie-breaking order, and the quadratic
worst-case behaviour, quicksort was <I>almost</I> replaced completely with
a stable mergesort.  <I>Stable</I> means that ties are broken to preserve
the original order of appearance in the input array.  So


<P>




<PRE>
    sort { ($a % 2) &lt;=&gt; ($b % 2) } (3,1,4,1,5,9);

</PRE>




<P>


will yield (4,3,1,1,5,9), guaranteed.  The even and odd numbers
appear in the output in the same order they appeared in the input.
Mergesort has worst case O(N log N) behaviour, the best value
attainable.  And, ironically, this mergesort does particularly
well where quicksort goes quadratic:  mergesort sorts (1..$N, 1..$N)
in O(N) time.  But quicksort was rescued at the last moment because
it is faster than mergesort on certain inputs and platforms.
For example, if you really <I>don't</I> care about the order of even
and odd digits, quicksort will run in O(N) time; it's very good
at sorting many repetitions of a small number of distinct elements.
The quicksort divide and conquer strategy works well on platforms
with relatively small, very fast, caches.  Eventually, the problem gets
whittled down to one that fits in the cache, from which point it
benefits from the increased memory speed.


<P>


Quicksort was rescued by implementing a sort pragma to control aspects
of the sort.  The <B>stable</B> subpragma forces stable behaviour,
regardless of algorithm.  The <B>_quicksort</B> and <B>_mergesort</B>
subpragmas are heavy-handed ways to select the underlying implementation.
The leading <TT>&quot;_&quot;</TT> is a reminder that these subpragmas may not survive
beyond 5.8.  More appropriate mechanisms for selecting the implementation
exist, but they wouldn't have arrived in time to save quicksort.
<DT>*<DD>
Hashes now use Bob Jenkins ``One-at-a-Time'' hashing key algorithm
( <A HREF="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.php">http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html</A> ).  This algorithm is
reasonably fast while producing a much better spread of values than
the old hashing algorithm (originally by Chris Torek, later tweaked by
Ilya Zakharevich).  Hash values output from the algorithm on a hash of
all 3-char printable <FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT> keys comes much closer to passing the
<FONT SIZE="-1">DIEHARD</FONT> random number generation tests.  According to perlbench, this
change has not affected the overall speed of Perl.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL</FONT> now explains how you can configure Perl to use 64-bit
integers even on non-64-bit platforms.
<DT>*<DD>
Policy.sh policy change: if you are reusing a Policy.sh file
(see <FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL</FONT>) and you use Configure -Dprefix=/foo/bar and in the old
Policy <TT>$prefix</TT> eq <TT>$siteprefix</TT> and <TT>$prefix</TT> eq <TT>$vendorprefix</TT>, all of
them will now be changed to the new prefix, /foo/bar.  (Previously
only <TT>$prefix</TT> changed.)  If you do not like this new behaviour,
specify prefix, siteprefix, and vendorprefix explicitly.
<DT>*<DD>
A new optional location for Perl libraries, otherlibdirs, is available.
It can be used for example for vendor add-ons without disturbing Perl's
own library directories.
<DT>*<DD>
In many platforms, the vendor-supplied 'cc' is too stripped-down to
build Perl (basically, 'cc' doesn't do <FONT SIZE="-1">ANSI</FONT> C).  If this seems
to be the case and 'cc' does not seem to be the <FONT SIZE="-1">GNU</FONT> C compiler
'gcc', an automatic attempt is made to find and use 'gcc' instead.
<DT>*<DD>
gcc needs to closely track the operating system release to avoid
build problems. If Configure finds that gcc was built for a different
operating system release than is running, it now gives a clearly visible
warning that there may be trouble ahead.
<DT>*<DD>
Since Perl 5.8 is not binary-compatible with previous releases
of Perl, Configure no longer suggests including the 5.005
modules in <TT>@INC</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
Configure <TT>&quot;-S&quot;</TT> can now run non-interactively. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Configure support for pdp11-style memory models has been removed due
to obsolescence. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
configure.gnu now works with options with whitespace in them.

installperl now outputs everything to <FONT SIZE="-1">STDERR</FONT>.
<DT>*<DD>
Because PerlIO is now the default on most platforms, ``-perlio'' doesn't
get appended to the <TT>$Config</TT>{archname} (also known as $^O) anymore.
Instead, if you explicitly choose not to use perlio (Configure command
line option -Uuseperlio), you will get ``-stdio'' appended.
<DT>*<DD>
Another change related to the architecture name is that ``-64all''
(-Duse64bitall, or ``maximally 64-bit'') is appended only if your
pointers are 64 bits wide.  (To be exact, the use64bitall is ignored.)
<DT>*<DD>
In <FONT SIZE="-1">AFS</FONT> installations, one can configure the root of the <FONT SIZE="-1">AFS</FONT> to be
somewhere else than the default <I>/afs</I> by using the Configure
parameter <TT>&quot;-Dafsroot=/some/where/else&quot;</TT>.

<FONT SIZE="-1">APPLLIB_EXP</FONT>, a lesser-known configuration-time definition, has been

Building Berkeley <FONT SIZE="-1">DB3</FONT> for compatibility modes for <FONT SIZE="-1">DB</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">NDBM</FONT>, and <FONT SIZE="-1">ODBM</FONT>
has been documented in <FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL</FONT>.
<DT>*<DD>
If you have <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT> access (either network or a local copy such as a
<FONT SIZE="-1">CD-ROM</FONT>) you can during specify extra modules to Configure to build and
install with Perl using the -Dextras=...  option.  See <FONT SIZE="-1">INSTALL</FONT> for
more details.
<DT>*<DD>
In addition to config.over, a new override file, config.arch, is
available.  This file is supposed to be used by hints file writers
for architecture-wide changes (as opposed to config.over which is
for site-wide changes).
<DT>*<DD>
If your file system supports symbolic links, you can build Perl outside
of the source directory by


<P>




<PRE>
        mkdir perl/build/directory
        cd perl/build/directory
        sh /path/to/perl/source/Configure -Dmksymlinks ...

</PRE>




<P>


This will create in perl/build/directory a tree of symbolic links
pointing to files in /path/to/perl/source.  The original files are left
unaffected.  After Configure has finished, you can just say


<P>




<PRE>
        make all test

</PRE>




<P>


and Perl will be built and tested, all in perl/build/directory.

The Thread extension is now not built at all under ithreads

Thread extension requires being Configured with <TT>&quot;-Duse5005threads&quot;</TT>).


<P>


<B>Note that the 5.005 threads are unsupported and deprecated: if you

The Gconvert macro ($Config{d_Gconvert}) used by perl for stringifying
floating-point numbers is now more picky about using sprintf %.*g

<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> dynamic loading should be now better supported.
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> should now work better with gcc, threads, and 64-bitness.  Also the
long doubles support in <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> should be better now.  See perlaix.
<DT>*<DD>
AtheOS ( <A HREF="http://www.atheos.cx/">http://www.atheos.cx/</A> ) is a new platform.

<FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT> platforms (z/OS (also known as <FONT SIZE="-1">OS/390</FONT>), <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX-BC</FONT>, and <FONT SIZE="-1">VM/ESA</FONT>)
have been regained.  Many test suite tests still fail and the
co-existence of Unicode and <FONT SIZE="-1">EBCDIC</FONT> isn't quite settled, but the
situation is much better than with Perl 5.6.  See perlos390,
perlbs2000 (for <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX-BC</FONT>), and perlvmesa for more information.
<DT>*<DD>
Building perl with -Duseithreads or -Duse5005threads now works under
HP-UX 10.20 (previously it only worked under 10.30 or later). You will
need a thread library package installed. See <FONT SIZE="-1">README</FONT>.hpux. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> Classic is now supported in the mainstream source package
(MacPerl has of course been available since perl 5.004 but now the

[561]
<DT>*<DD>
Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X (or Darwin) should now be able to build Perl even on <FONT SIZE="-1">HFS+</FONT>

process.)
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">NCR</FONT> MP-RAS is now supported. [561]

( <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/pth.php">http://www.gnu.org/software/pth/pth.html</A> ).  All thread tests
of Perl now work, but not without adding some <I>yield()</I>s to the tests,
so while pth (and other userlevel thread implementations) can be
considered to be ``working'' with Perl ithreads, keep in mind the
possible non-preemptability of the underlying thread implementation.
<DT>*<DD>
Stratus <FONT SIZE="-1">VOS</FONT> is now supported using Perl's native build method
(Configure).  This is the recommended method to build Perl on
<FONT SIZE="-1">VOS</FONT>.  The older methods, which build miniperl, are still
available.  See perlvos. [561+]
<DT>*<DD>
The Amdahl <FONT SIZE="-1">UTS</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT> mainframe platform is now supported. [561]

<DT>*<DD>
z/OS (formerly known as <FONT SIZE="-1">OS/390</FONT>, formerly known as <FONT SIZE="-1">MVS</FONT> <FONT SIZE="-1">OE</FONT>) now has

<H2>Selected Bug Fixes</H2>

<A NAME="ixABJ"></A>
Numerous memory leaks and uninitialized memory accesses have been
hunted down.  Most importantly, anonymous subs used to leak quite
a bit. [561]
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The autouse pragma didn't work for Multi::Part::Function::Names.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>caller()</I> could cause core dumps in certain situations.  Carp was
sometimes affected by this problem.  In particular, <I>caller()</I> now
returns a subroutine name of <TT>&quot;(unknown)&quot;</TT> for subroutines that have
been removed from the symbol table.
<DT>*<DD>
chop(@list) in list context returned the characters chopped in
reverse order.  This has been reversed to be in the right order. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Configure no longer includes the <FONT SIZE="-1">DBM</FONT> libraries (dbm, gdbm, db, ndbm)
when building the Perl binary.  The only exception to this is SunOS 4.x,
which needs them. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
The behaviour of non-decimal but numeric string constants such as
``0x23'' was platform-dependent: in some platforms that was seen as 35,
in some as 0, in some as a floating point number (don't ask).  This
was caused by Perl's using the operating system libraries in a situation
where the result of the string to number conversion is undefined: now
Perl consistently handles such strings as zero in numeric contexts.
<DT>*<DD>
Several debugger fixes: exit code now reflects the script exit code,
condition <TT>&quot;0&quot;</TT> now treated correctly, the <TT>&quot;d&quot;</TT> command now checks
line number, <TT>$.</TT> no longer gets corrupted, and all debugger output
now goes correctly to the socket if RemotePort is set. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
The debugger (perl5db.pl) has been modified to present a more
consistent commands interface, via (CommandSet=580).  perl5db.t was
also added to test the changes, and as a placeholder for further tests.


<P>


See perldebug.
<DT>*<DD>
The debugger has a new <TT>&quot;dumpDepth&quot;</TT> option to control the maximum
depth to which nested structures are dumped.  The <TT>&quot;x&quot;</TT> command has
been extended so that <TT>&quot;x N EXPR&quot;</TT> dumps out the value of <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>EXPR</I></FONT><I></I> to a
depth of at most <I>N</I> levels.
<DT>*<DD>
The debugger can now show lexical variables if you have the <FONT SIZE="-1">CPAN</FONT>
module PadWalker installed.
<DT>*<DD>
The order of DESTROYs has been made more predictable.
<DT>*<DD>
Perl 5.6.0 could emit spurious warnings about redefinition of
<I>dl_error()</I> when statically building extensions into perl.
This has been corrected. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
dprofpp -R didn't work.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>*foo{FORMAT}</TT> now works.
<DT>*<DD>
Infinity is now recognized as a number.
<DT>*<DD>
UNIVERSAL::isa no longer caches methods incorrectly.  (This broke
the Tk extension with 5.6.0.) [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Lexicals I: lexicals outside an eval &quot;`` weren't resolved
correctly inside a subroutine definition inside the eval ''`` if they
were not already referenced in the top level of the eval''&quot;ed code.
<DT>*<DD>
Lexicals <FONT SIZE="-1">II:</FONT> lexicals leaked at file scope into subroutines that
were declared before the lexicals.
<DT>*<DD>
Lexical warnings now propagating correctly between scopes
and into <TT>&quot;eval &quot;...&quot;&quot;</TT>.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;use warnings qw(FATAL all)&quot;</TT> did not work as intended.  This has been
corrected. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<I>warnings::enabled()</I> now reports the state of $^W correctly if the caller
isn't using lexical warnings. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Line renumbering with eval and <TT>&quot;#line&quot;</TT> now works. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Fixed numerous memory leaks, especially in eval &quot;&quot;.
<DT>*<DD>
Localised tied variables no longer leak memory

Localised hash elements (and <TT>%ENV</TT>) are correctly unlocalised to not
exist, if they didn't before they were localised.

As a side effect of this fix, tied hash interfaces <B>must</B> define
the <FONT SIZE="-1">EXISTS</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">DELETE</FONT> methods.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>mkdir()</I> now ignores trailing slashes in the directory name,
as mandated by <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT>.
<DT>*<DD>
Some versions of glibc have a broken <I>modfl()</I>.  This affects builds
with <TT>&quot;-Duselongdouble&quot;</TT>.  This version of Perl detects this brokenness
and has a workaround for it.  The glibc release 2.2.2 is known to have
fixed the <I>modfl()</I> bug.
<DT>*<DD>
Modulus of unsigned numbers now works (4063328477 % 65535 used to
return 27406, instead of 27047). [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Some ``not a number'' warnings introduced in 5.6.0 eliminated to be
more compatible with 5.005.  Infinity is now recognised as a number. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Numeric conversions did not recognize changes in the string value
properly in certain circumstances. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Attributes (such as :shared) didn't work with <I>our()</I>.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>our()</I> variables will not cause bogus ``Variable will not stay shared''
warnings. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
``our'' variables of the same name declared in two sibling blocks
resulted in bogus warnings about ``redeclaration'' of the variables.
The problem has been corrected. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
pack ``Z'' now correctly terminates the string with ``\0''.
<DT>*<DD>
Fix password routines which in some shadow password platforms
(e.g. <FONT SIZE="-1">HP-UX</FONT>) caused <I>getpwent()</I> to return every other entry.
<DT>*<DD>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5OPT</FONT> environment variable (for passing command line arguments
to Perl) didn't work for more than a single group of options. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">PERL5OPT</FONT> with embedded spaces didn't work.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>printf()</I> no longer resets the numeric locale to ``C''.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;qw(a\\b)&quot;</TT> now parses correctly as <TT>'a\\b'</TT>: that is, as three
characters, not four. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<I>pos()</I> did not return the correct value within s///ge in earlier
versions.  This is now handled correctly. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Printing quads (64-bit integers) with printf/sprintf now works
without the q L ll prefixes (assuming you are on a quad-capable platform).
<DT>*<DD>
Regular expressions on references and overloaded scalars now work. [561+]
<DT>*<DD>
Right-hand side magic (<FONT SIZE="-1">GMAGIC</FONT>) could in many cases such as string
concatenation be invoked too many times.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>scalar()</I> now forces scalar context even when used in void context.
<DT>*<DD>
<FONT SIZE="-1">SOCKS</FONT> support is now much more robust.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>sort()</I> arguments are now compiled in the right wantarray context
(they were accidentally using the context of the <I>sort()</I> itself).
The comparison block is now run in scalar context, and the arguments
to be sorted are always provided list context. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Changed the <FONT SIZE="-1">POSIX</FONT> character class <TT>&quot;[[:space:]]&quot;</TT> to include the (very
rarely used) vertical tab character.  Added a new POSIX-ish character
class <TT>&quot;[[:blank:]]&quot;</TT> which stands for horizontal whitespace
(currently, the space and the tab).
<DT>*<DD>
The tainting behaviour of <I>sprintf()</I> has been rationalized.  It does
not taint the result of floating point formats anymore, making the
behaviour consistent with that of string interpolation. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Some cases of inconsistent taint propagation (such as within hash
values) have been fixed.
<DT>*<DD>
The <FONT SIZE="-1">RE</FONT> engine found in Perl 5.6.0 accidentally pessimised certain kinds
of simple pattern matches.  These are now handled better. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Regular expression debug output (whether through <TT>&quot;use re 'debug'&quot;</TT>
or via <TT>&quot;-Dr&quot;</TT>) now looks better. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Multi-line matches like <TT>&quot;&quot;a\nxb\n&quot; =~ /(?!\A)x/m&quot;</TT> were flawed.  The
bug has been fixed. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Use of $&amp; could trigger a core dump under some situations.  This
is now avoided. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
The regular expression captured submatches ($1, <TT>$2</TT>, ...) are now
more consistently unset if the match fails, instead of leaving false
data lying around in them. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
<I>readline()</I> on files opened in ``slurp'' mode could return an extra
&quot;&quot; (blank line) at the end in certain situations.  This has been
corrected. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Autovivification of symbolic references of special variables described
in perlvar (as in <TT>&quot;${$num}&quot;</TT>) was accidentally disabled.  This works
again now. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Sys::Syslog ignored the <TT>&quot;LOG_AUTH&quot;</TT> constant.
<DT>*<DD>
$AUTOLOAD, <I>sort()</I>, <I>lock()</I>, and spawning subprocesses
in multiple threads simultaneously are now thread-safe.
<DT>*<DD>
Tie::Array's <FONT SIZE="-1">SPLICE</FONT> method was broken.
<DT>*<DD>
Allow a read-only string on the left-hand side of a non-modifying tr///.
<DT>*<DD>
If <TT>&quot;STDERR&quot;</TT> is tied, warnings caused by <TT>&quot;warn&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;die&quot;</TT> now
correctly pass to it.
<DT>*<DD>
Several Unicode fixes.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
BOMs (byte order marks) at the beginning of Perl files
(scripts, modules) should now be transparently skipped.
<FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">UCS-2</FONT> encoded Perl files should now be read correctly.
<DT>*<DD>
The character tables have been updated to Unicode 3.2.0.
<DT>*<DD>
Comparing with utf8 data does not magically upgrade non-utf8 data
into utf8.  (This was a problem for example if you were mixing data
from I/O and Unicode data: your output might have got magically encoded
as <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>.)
<DT>*<DD>
Generating illegal Unicode code points such as U+FFFE, or the <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-16</FONT>
surrogates, now also generates an optional warning.
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;IsAlnum&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;IsAlpha&quot;</TT>, and <TT>&quot;IsWord&quot;</TT> now match titlecase.
<DT>*<DD>
Concatenation with the <TT>&quot;.&quot;</TT> operator or via variable interpolation,
<TT>&quot;eq&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;substr&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;reverse&quot;</TT>, <TT>&quot;quotemeta&quot;</TT>, the <TT>&quot;x&quot;</TT> operator,
substitution with <TT>&quot;s///&quot;</TT>, single-quoted <FONT SIZE="-1">UTF-8</FONT>, should now work.
<DT>*<DD>
The <TT>&quot;tr///&quot;</TT> operator now works.  Note that the <TT>&quot;tr///CU&quot;</TT>
functionality has been removed (but see pack('U0', ...)).
<DT>*<DD>
<TT>&quot;eval &quot;v200&quot;&quot;</TT> now works.
<DT>*<DD>
Perl 5.6.0 parsed m/\x{ab}/ incorrectly, leading to spurious warnings.
This has been corrected. [561]
<DT>*<DD>
Zero entries were missing from the Unicode classes such as <TT>&quot;IsDigit&quot;</TT>.

The <TT>&quot;waitpid&quot;</TT> emulation has been improved.  The worst bug (now fixed)

<P>


The <TT>&quot;system&quot;</TT> function and backticks operator have improved
functionality and better error handling. [561]


<P>


File access tests now use current process privileges rather than the
user's default privileges, which could sometimes result in a mismatch
between reported access and actual access.  This improvement is only
available on <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS</FONT> v6.0 and later.


<P>


There is a new <TT>&quot;kill&quot;</TT> implementation based on <TT>&quot;sys$sigprc&quot;</TT> that allows
older <FONT SIZE="-1">VMS</FONT> systems (pre-7.0) to use <TT>&quot;kill&quot;</TT> to send signals rather than
simply force exit.  This implementation also allows later systems to
call <TT>&quot;kill&quot;</TT> from within a signal handler.

The behavior of <I>system()</I> with multiple arguments has been rationalized.
Each unquoted argument will be automatically quoted to protect whitespace,

Windows <TT>&quot;cmd&quot;</TT> shell specific quoting in perl programs.


<P>


Note that this means that some scripts that may have relied on earlier
buggy behavior may no longer work correctly.  For example,
<TT>&quot;system(&quot;nmake /nologo&quot;, @args)&quot;</TT> will now attempt to run the file
<TT>&quot;nmake /nologo&quot;</TT> and will fail when such a file isn't found.

<A NAME="lbBN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Security Vulnerability Closed [561]</H2>

<A NAME="ixABN"></A>
(This change was already made in 5.7.0 but bears repeating here.)
(5.7.0 came out before 5.6.1: the development branch 5.7 released
earlier than the maintenance branch 5.6)
<P>

A potential security vulnerability in the optional suidperl component
of Perl was identified in August 2000.  suidperl is neither built nor
installed by default.  As of November 2001 the only known vulnerable
platform is Linux, most likely all Linux distributions.  <FONT SIZE="-1">CERT</FONT> and
various vendors and distributors have been alerted about the vulnerability.
See <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt">http://www.cpan.org/src/5.0/sperl-2000-08-05/sperl-2000-08-05.txt</A>
for more information.
<P>

The problem was caused by Perl trying to report a suspected security
exploit attempt using an external program, /bin/mail.  On Linux
platforms the /bin/mail program had an undocumented feature which
when combined with suidperl gave access to a root shell, resulting in
a serious compromise instead of reporting the exploit attempt.  If you
don't have /bin/mail, or if you have 'safe setuid scripts', or if
suidperl is not installed, you are safe.
<P>

The exploit attempt reporting feature has been completely removed from
Perl 5.8.0 (and the maintenance release 5.6.1, and it was removed also
from all the Perl 5.7 releases), so that particular vulnerability
isn't there anymore.  However, further security vulnerabilities are,
unfortunately, always possible.  The suidperl functionality is most
probably going to be removed in Perl 5.10.  In any case, suidperl
should only be used by security experts who know exactly what they are
doing and why they are using suidperl instead of some other solution
such as sudo ( see <A HREF="http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/">http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/</A> ).
<A NAME="lbBO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>New Tests</H2>

<A NAME="ixABO"></A>
Several new tests have been added, especially for the <I>lib</I> and
<I>ext</I> subsections.  There are now about 69 000 individual tests
(spread over about 700 test scripts), in the regression suite (5.6.1
has about 11 700 tests, in 258 test scripts)  The exact numbers depend
on the platform and Perl configuration used.  Many of the new tests
are of course introduced by the new modules, but still in general Perl
is now more thoroughly tested.
<P>

Because of the large number of tests, running the regression suite
will take considerably longer time than it used to: expect the suite
to take up to 4-5 times longer to run than in perl 5.6.  On a really
fast machine you can hope to finish the suite in about 6-8 minutes
(wallclock time).
<P>

The tests are now reported in a different order than in earlier Perls.
(This happens because the test scripts from under t/lib have been moved
to be closer to the library/extension they are testing.)

<A NAME="ixABR"></A>

    local %tied_array;

<P>

doesn't work as one would expect: the old value is restored
incorrectly.  This will be changed in a future release, but we don't
know yet what the new semantics will exactly be.  In any case, the
change will break existing code that relies on the current
(ill-defined) semantics, so just avoid doing this in general.
<A NAME="lbBS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Building Extensions Can Fail Because Of Largefiles

</H2>

<A NAME="ixABS"></A>
Some extensions like mod_perl are known to have issues with
`largefiles', a change brought by Perl 5.6.0 in which file offsets
default to 64 bits wide, where supported.  Modules may fail to compile
at all, or they may compile and work incorrectly.  Currently, there
is no good solution for the problem, but Configure now provides
appropriate non-largefile ccflags, ldflags, libswanted, and libs
in the <TT>%Config</TT> hash (e.g., <TT>$Config</TT>{ccflags_nolargefiles}) so the
extensions that are having problems can try configuring themselves
without the largefileness.  This is admittedly not a clean solution,
and the solution may not even work at all.  One potential failure is
whether one can (or, if one can, whether it's a good idea to) link
together at all binaries with different ideas about file offsets;
all this is platform-dependent.

<A NAME="ixABY"></A>
You may get errors like 'Undefined symbol ``Perl_get_sv''' or ``can't
resolve symbol 'Perl_get_sv''', or the symbol may be ``Perl_sv_2pv''.
This probably means that you are trying to use an older shared Perl
library (or extensions linked with such) with Perl 5.8.0 executable.
Perl used to have such a subroutine, but that is no more the case.
Check your shared library path, and any shared Perl libraries in those
directories.
<P>

Sometimes this problem may also indicate a partial Perl 5.8.0
installation, see ``Mac <FONT SIZE="-1">OS</FONT> X dyld undefined symbols'' for an
example and how to deal with it.
<A NAME="lbBZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Self-tying Problems</H2>

<A NAME="ixABZ"></A>
Self-tying of arrays and hashes is broken in rather deep and
hard-to-fix ways.  As a stop-gap measure to avoid people from getting
frustrated at the mysterious results (core dumps, most often), it is
forbidden for now (you will get a fatal error even from an attempt).
<P>

A change to self-tying of globs has caused them to be recursively
referenced (see: ``Two-Phased Garbage Collection'' in perlobj).  You
will now need an explicit untie to destroy a self-tied glob.  This
behaviour may be fixed at a later date.

These failures are unlikely to get fixed as 5.005-style threads

For normal arrays <TT>&quot;$foo = \$bar[1]&quot;</TT> will assign <TT>&quot;undef&quot;</TT> to
<TT>$bar[1]</TT> (assuming that it didn't exist before), but for

One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class or

exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of
Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.
<P>

One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent
unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may
need to be mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode capability
of the filesystem becomes important--- and there unfortunately aren't
portable answers.

In <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> 4.2, Perl extensions that use C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT> functions that use statics
may have problems in that the statics are not getting initialized.
In newer <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> releases, this has been solved by linking Perl with
the libC_r library, but unfortunately in <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> 4.2 the said library
has an obscure bug where the various functions related to time
(such as <I>time()</I> and <I>gettimeofday()</I>) return broken values, and
therefore in <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> 4.2 Perl is not linked against libC_r.

vac 5.0.0.0 May Produce Buggy Code For Perl


<P>


The <FONT SIZE="-1">AIX</FONT> C compiler vac version 5.0.0.0 may produce buggy code,
resulting in a few random tests failing when run as part of ``make
test'', but when the failing tests are run by hand, they succeed.
We suggest upgrading to at least vac version 5.0.1.0, that has been
known to compile Perl correctly.  ``lslpp -L|grep vac.C'' will tell
you the vac version.  See <FONT SIZE="-1">README</FONT>.aix.
<DT>*<DD>
If building threaded Perl, you may get compilation warning from pp_sys.c:

<P>


This is harmless; it is caused by the <I>getnetbyaddr()</I> and <I>getnetbyaddr_r()</I>

<H2>Alpha systems with old gccs fail several tests</H2>

<A NAME="ixACH"></A>
If you see op/pack, op/pat, op/regexp, or ext/Storable tests failing
in a Linux/alpha or *BSD/Alpha, it's probably time to upgrade your gcc.
gccs prior to 2.95.3 are definitely not good enough, and gcc 3.1 may
be even better.  (RedHat Linux/alpha with gcc 3.1 reported no problems,
as did Linux 2.4.18 with gcc 2.95.4.)  (In Tru64, it is preferable to

If you are building on a <FONT SIZE="-1">UFS</FONT> partition, you will also probably see

Also the ext/POSIX/t/posix.t subtest #10 fails but it is skipped for

you probably have an old pre-Perl-5.8.0 installation (or parts of one)

This is caused by a bug in the awk utility of UNICOS/mk.  You can ignore
the error, but it does cause a slight problem: you cannot fully
benefit from the h2ph utility (see h2ph) that can be used to
convert C headers to Perl libraries, mainly used to be able to access
from Perl the constants defined using C preprocessor, cpp.  Because of
the above error, parts of the converted headers will be invisible.
Luckily, these days the need for h2ph is rare.

If building Perl with interpreter threads (ithreads), the
<I>getgrent()</I>, <I>getgrnam()</I>, and <I>getgrgid()</I> functions cannot return the

<TT>&quot;Thread::&quot;</TT> (the <TT>&quot;threads&quot;</TT> and <TT>&quot;threads::shared&quot;</TT> themselves are
more pragma-like, they affect compile-time, so they stay lowercase).

<H2>Reporting Bugs</H2>

<A NAME="ixADL"></A>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at <A HREF="http://bugs.perl.org/">http://bugs.perl.org/</A> .  There may also be
information at <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/">http://www.perl.com/</A> , the Perl Home Page.
<P>

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <B>perlbug</B>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of <TT>&quot;perl -V&quot;</TT>, will be sent off to <A HREF="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</A> to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
