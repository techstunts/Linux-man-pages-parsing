This manpage is a summary of some of the features of
<B>cvs</B>.  It is auto-generated from an appendix of the CVS manual.
For more in-depth documentation, please consult the
Cederqvist manual (via the
<B>info CVS</B>

command or otherwise,
as described in the SEE ALSO section of this manpage).  Cross-references
in this man page refer to nodes in the same.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CVS commands</H2>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Guide to CVS commands</H3>


<P>



This appendix describes the overall structure of
<B>cvs</B> commands, and describes some commands in
detail (others are described elsewhere; for a quick
reference to <B>cvs</B> commands, see node `Invoking CVSaq in the CVS manual).

<P>

<H3>Overall structure of CVS commands</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>

<P>



The overall format of all <B>cvs</B> commands is:

<P>





<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
cvs [ cvs_options ] cvs_command [ command_options ] [ command_args ]
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>cvs</B>
<DT><DD>
The name of the <B>cvs</B> program.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>cvs_options</B>
<DT><DD>
Some options that affect all sub-commands of <B>cvs</B>.  These are
described below.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>cvs_command</B>
<DT><DD>
One of several different sub-commands.  Some of the commands have
aliases that can be used instead; those aliases are noted in the
reference manual for that command.  There are only two situations
where you may omit <B>cvs_command</B>: <B>cvs -H</B> elicits a
list of available commands, and <B>cvs -v</B> displays version
information on <B>cvs</B> itself.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>command_options</B>
<DT><DD>
Options that are specific for the command.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>command_args</B>
<DT><DD>
Arguments to the commands.

<P>



There is unfortunately some confusion between
<B>cvs_options</B> and <B>command_options</B>.
When given as a <B>cvs_option</B>, some options only
affect some of the commands.  When given as a
<B>command_option</B> it may have a different meaning, and
be accepted by more commands.  In other words, do not
take the above categorization too seriously.  Look at
the documentation instead.

<P>



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Exit status</H2>

<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>CVSaqs exit status</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>

<P>



<B>cvs</B> can indicate to the calling environment whether it
succeeded or failed by setting its <I>exit status</I>.
The exact way of testing the exit status will vary from
one operating system to another.  For example in a unix
shell script the <B>$?</B> variable will be 0 if the
last command returned a successful exit status, or
greater than 0 if the exit status indicated failure.

<P>



If <B>cvs</B> is successful, it returns a successful status;
if there is an error, it prints an error message and
returns a failure status.  The one exception to this is
the <B>cvs diff</B> command.  It will return a
successful status if it found no differences, or a
failure status if there were differences or if there
was an error.  Because this behavior provides no good
way to detect errors, in the future it is possible that
<B>cvs diff</B> will be changed to behave like the
other <B>cvs</B> commands.

<P>



<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>~/.cvsrc</H2>

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Default options and the ~/.cvsrc file</H3>

<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>

<P>



There are some <B>command_options</B> that are used so
often that you might have set up an alias or some other
means to make sure you always specify that option.  One
example (the one that drove the implementation of the
<B>.cvsrc</B> support, actually) is that many people find the
default output of the <B>diff</B> command to be very
hard to read, and that either context diffs or unidiffs
are much easier to understand.

<P>



The <B>~/.cvsrc</B> file is a way that you can add
default options to <B>cvs_commands</B> within cvs,
instead of relying on aliases or other shell scripts.

<P>



The format of the <B>~/.cvsrc</B> file is simple.  The
file is searched for a line that begins with the same
name as the <B>cvs_command</B> being executed.  If a
match is found, then the remainder of the line is split
up (at whitespace characters) into separate options and
added to the command arguments <I>before</I> any
options from the command line.

<P>



If a command has two names (e.g., <B>checkout</B> and
<B>co</B>), the official name, not necessarily the one
used on the command line, will be used to match against
the file.  So if this is the contents of the useraqs
<B>~/.cvsrc</B> file:

<P>





<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
log -N
<DT><DD>
diff -uN
<DT><DD>
rdiff -u
<DT><DD>
update -Pd
<DT><DD>
checkout -P
<DT><DD>
release -d
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



the command <B>cvs checkout foo</B> would have the
<B>-P</B> option added to the arguments, as well as
<B>cvs co foo</B>.

<P>



With the example file above, the output from <B>cvs
diff foobar</B> will be in unidiff format.  <B>cvs diff
-c foobar</B> will provide context diffs, as usual.
Getting &quot;old&quot; format diffs would be slightly more
complicated, because <B>diff</B> doesnaqt have an option
to specify use of the &quot;old&quot; format, so you would need
<B>cvs -f diff foobar</B>.

<P>



In place of the command name you can use <B>cvs</B> to
specify global options (see node `Global optionsaq in the CVS manual).  For
example the following line in <B>.cvsrc</B>

<P>





<P>



<DT><DD>
cvs -z6
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



causes <B>cvs</B> to use compression level 6.

<P>



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Global options</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAQ"></A>

<P>



The available <B>cvs_options</B> (that are given to the
left of <B>cvs_command</B>) are:

<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>--allow-root=</B><I>rootdir</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Specify legal <B>cvsroot</B> directory.  See
see node `Password authentication serveraq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<A NAME="ixAAR"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAS"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-a</B>
<DT><DD>
Authenticate all communication between the client and
the server.  Only has an effect on the <B>cvs</B> client.
As of this writing, this is only implemented when using
a GSSAPI connection (see node `GSSAPI authenticatedaq in the CVS manual).
Authentication prevents certain sorts of attacks
involving hijacking the active <B>tcp</B> connection.
Enabling authentication does not enable encryption.

<P>



<A NAME="ixAAT"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAU"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-b </B><I>bindir</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
In <B>cvs</B> 1.9.18 and older, this specified that
<B>rcs</B> programs are in the <I>bindir</I> directory.
Current versions of <B>cvs</B> do not run <B>rcs</B>
programs; for compatibility this option is accepted,
but it does nothing.

<P>



<A NAME="ixAAV"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAW"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-T </B><I>tempdir</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Use <I>tempdir</I> as the directory where temporary files are
located.  Overrides the setting of the <B>$TMPDIR</B> environment
variable and any precompiled directory.  This parameter should be
specified as an absolute pathname.
(When running client/server, <B>-T</B> affects only the local process;
specifying <B>-T</B> for the client has no effect on the server and
vice versa.)

<P>



<A NAME="ixAAX"></A>
<A NAME="ixAAY"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-d </B><I>cvs_root_directory</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Use <I>cvs_root_directory</I> as the root directory
pathname of the repository.  Overrides the setting of
the <B>$CVSROOT</B> environment variable.  see node `Repositoryaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<A NAME="ixAAZ"></A>
<A NAME="ixABA"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-e </B><I>editor</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Use <I>editor</I> to enter revision log information.  Overrides the
setting of the <B>$CVSEDITOR</B> and <B>$EDITOR</B>
environment variables.  For more information, see
see node `Committing your changesaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-f</B>
<DT><DD>
Do not read the <B>~/.cvsrc</B> file.  This
option is most often used because of the
non-orthogonality of the <B>cvs</B> option set.  For
example, the <B>cvs log</B> option <B>-N</B> (turn off
display of tag names) does not have a corresponding
option to turn the display on.  So if you have
<B>-N</B> in the <B>~/.cvsrc</B> entry for <B>log</B>,
you may need to use <B>-f</B> to show the tag names.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-H</B>
<DT><DD>
<DT><DD>
<B>--help</B>
<DT><DD>
Display usage information about the specified <B>cvs_command</B>
(but do not actually execute the command).  If you donaqt specify
a command name, <B>cvs -H</B> displays overall help for
<B>cvs</B>, including a list of other help options.

<P>



<A NAME="ixABB"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-n</B>
<DT><DD>
Do not change any files.  Attempt to execute the
<B>cvs_command</B>, but only to issue reports; do not remove,
update, or merge any existing files, or create any new files.

<P>



Note that <B>cvs</B> will not necessarily produce exactly
the same output as without <B>-n</B>.  In some cases
the output will be the same, but in other cases
<B>cvs</B> will skip some of the processing that would
have been required to produce the exact same output.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-Q</B>
<DT><DD>
Cause the command to be really quiet; the command will only
generate output for serious problems.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-q</B>
<DT><DD>
Cause the command to be somewhat quiet; informational messages,
such as reports of recursion through subdirectories, are
suppressed.

<P>



<A NAME="ixABC"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-r</B>
<DT><DD>
Make new working files read-only.  Same effect
as if the <B>$CVSREAD</B> environment variable is set
(see node `Environment variablesaq in the CVS manual).  The default is to
make working files writable, unless watches are on
(see node `Watchesaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-s </B><I>variable</I><B>=</B><I>value</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Set a user variable (see node `Variablesaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



<A NAME="ixABD"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-t</B>
<DT><DD>
Trace program execution; display messages showing the steps of
<B>cvs</B> activity.  Particularly useful with <B>-n</B> to explore the
potential impact of an unfamiliar command.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-v</B>
<DT><DD>
<DT><DD>
<B>--version</B>
<DT><DD>
Display version and copyright information for <B>cvs</B>.

<P>



<A NAME="ixABE"></A>
<A NAME="ixABF"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-w</B>
<DT><DD>
Make new working files read-write.  Overrides the
setting of the <B>$CVSREAD</B> environment variable.
Files are created read-write by default, unless <B>$CVSREAD</B> is
set or <B>-r</B> is given.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-x</B>
<DT><DD>
<A NAME="ixABG"></A>
Encrypt all communication between the client and the
server.  Only has an effect on the <B>cvs</B> client.  As
of this writing, this is only implemented when using a
GSSAPI connection (see node `GSSAPI authenticatedaq in the CVS manual) or a
Kerberos connection (see node `Kerberos authenticatedaq in the CVS manual).
Enabling encryption implies that message traffic is
also authenticated.  Encryption support is not
available by default; it must be enabled using a
special configure option, <B>--enable-encryption</B>,
when you build <B>cvs</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-z </B><I>gzip-level</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
<A NAME="ixABH"></A>
<A NAME="ixABI"></A>
Set the compression level.
Valid levels are 1 (high speed, low compression) to
9 (low speed, high compression), or 0 to disable
compression (the default).
Only has an effect on the <B>cvs</B> client.

<P>

<H2>Common options</H2>

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Common command options</H3>

<A NAME="ixABJ"></A>
<A NAME="ixABK"></A>

<P>



This section describes the <B>command_options</B> that
are available across several <B>cvs</B> commands.  These
options are always given to the right of
<B>cvs_command</B>. Not all
commands support all of these options; each option is
only supported for commands where it makes sense.
However, when a command has one of these options you
can almost always count on the same behavior of the
option as in other commands.  (Other command options,
which are listed with the individual commands, may have
different behavior from one <B>cvs</B> command to the other).

<P>



<B>Note: the history command is an exception; it supports
many options that conflict even with these standard options.</B>

<P>



<A NAME="ixABL"></A>
<A NAME="ixABM"></A>
<A NAME="ixABN"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>-D </B><I>date_spec</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Use the most recent revision no later than <I>date_spec</I>.
<I>date_spec</I> is a single argument, a date description
specifying a date in the past.

<P>



The specification is <I>sticky</I> when you use it to make a
private copy of a source file; that is, when you get a working
file using <B>-D</B>, <B>cvs</B> records the date you specified, so that
further updates in the same directory will use the same date
(for more information on sticky tags/dates, see node `Sticky tagsaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



<B>-D</B> is available with the <B>annotate</B>, <B>checkout</B>,
<B>diff</B>, <B>export</B>, <B>history</B>,
<B>rdiff</B>, <B>rtag</B>, and <B>update</B> commands.
(The <B>history</B> command uses this option in a
slightly different way; see node `history optionsaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



<A NAME="ixABO"></A>
<A NAME="ixABP"></A>
A wide variety of date formats are supported by
<B>cvs</B>.  The most standard ones are ISO8601 (from the
International Standards Organization) and the Internet
e-mail standard (specified in RFC822 as amended by
RFC1123).

<P>



ISO8601 dates have many variants but a few examples
are:

<P>





<P>



<DT><DD>
1972-09-24
<DT><DD>
1972-09-24 20:05
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



There are a lot more ISO8601 date formats, and <B>cvs</B>
accepts many of them, but you probably donaqt want to
hear the <I>whole</I> long story :-).

<P>



In addition to the dates allowed in Internet e-mail
itself, <B>cvs</B> also allows some of the fields to be
omitted.  For example:

<P>





<P>



<DT><DD>
24 Sep 1972 20:05
<DT><DD>
24 Sep
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



The date is interpreted as being in the
local timezone, unless a specific timezone is
specified.

<P>



These two date formats are preferred.  However,
<B>cvs</B> currently accepts a wide variety of other date
formats.  They are intentionally not documented here in
any detail, and future versions of <B>cvs</B> might not
accept all of them.

<P>



One such format is
<B></B><I>month</I><B>/</B><I>day</I><B>/</B><I>year</I><B></B>.  This may
confuse people who are accustomed to having the month
and day in the other order; <B>1/4/96</B> is January 4,
not April 1.

<P>



Remember to quote the argument to the <B>-D</B>
flag so that your shell doesnaqt interpret spaces as
argument separators.  A command using the <B>-D</B>
flag can look like this:

<P>





<P>



<DT><DD>
$ cvs diff -D &quot;1 hour ago&quot; cvs.texinfo
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



<A NAME="ixABQ"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-f</B>
<DT><DD>
When you specify a particular date or tag to <B>cvs</B> commands, they
normally ignore files that do not contain the tag (or did not
exist prior to the date) that you specified.  Use the <B>-f</B> option
if you want files retrieved even when there is no match for the
tag or date.  (The most recent revision of the file
will be used).

<P>



Note that even with <B>-f</B>, a tag that you specify
must exist (that is, in some file, not necessary in
every file).  This is so that <B>cvs</B> will continue to
give an error if you mistype a tag name.

<P>



<B>-f</B> is available with these commands:
<B>annotate</B>, <B>checkout</B>, <B>export</B>,
<B>rdiff</B>, <B>rtag</B>, and <B>update</B>.

<P>



<B>WARNING:  The commit and remove
commands also have a
-f option, but it has a different behavior for
those commands.  See see node `commit optionsaq in the CVS manual, and
see node `Removing filesaq in the CVS manual.</B>

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-k </B><I>kflag</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Alter the default processing of keywords.
see node `Keyword substitutionaq in the CVS manual, for the meaning of
<I>kflag</I>.  Your <I>kflag</I> specification is
<I>sticky</I> when you use it to create a private copy
of a source file; that is, when you use this option
with the <B>checkout</B> or <B>update</B> commands,
<B>cvs</B> associates your selected <I>kflag</I> with the
file, and continues to use it with future update
commands on the same file until you specify otherwise.

<P>



The <B>-k</B> option is available with the <B>add</B>,
<B>checkout</B>, <B>diff</B>, <B>import</B> and
<B>update</B> commands.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-l</B>
<DT><DD>
Local; run only in current working directory, rather than
recursing through subdirectories.

<P>



Available with the following commands: <B>annotate</B>, <B>checkout</B>,
<B>commit</B>, <B>diff</B>, <B>edit</B>, <B>editors</B>, <B>export</B>,
<B>log</B>, <B>rdiff</B>, <B>remove</B>, <B>rtag</B>,
<B>status</B>, <B>tag</B>, <B>unedit</B>, <B>update</B>, <B>watch</B>,
and <B>watchers</B>.

<P>



<A NAME="ixABR"></A>
<A NAME="ixABS"></A>
<DT><DD>
<B>-m </B><I>message</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Use <I>message</I> as log information, instead of
invoking an editor.

<P>



Available with the following commands: <B>add</B>,
<B>commit</B> and <B>import</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-n</B>
<DT><DD>
Do not run any tag program.  (A program can be
specified to run in the modules
database (see node `modulesaq in the CVS manual); this option bypasses it).

<P>



<B>Note: this is not the same as the cvs -n
program option, which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!</B>

<P>



Available with the <B>checkout</B>, <B>commit</B>, <B>export</B>,
and <B>rtag</B> commands.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-P</B>
<DT><DD>
Prune empty directories.  See see node `Removing directoriesaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-p</B>
<DT><DD>
Pipe the files retrieved from the repository to standard output,
rather than writing them in the current directory.  Available
with the <B>checkout</B> and <B>update</B> commands.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-R</B>
<DT><DD>
Process directories recursively.  This is on by default.

<P>



Available with the following commands: <B>annotate</B>, <B>checkout</B>,
<B>commit</B>, <B>diff</B>, <B>edit</B>, <B>editors</B>, <B>export</B>,
<B>rdiff</B>, <B>remove</B>, <B>rtag</B>,
<B>status</B>, <B>tag</B>, <B>unedit</B>, <B>update</B>, <B>watch</B>,
and <B>watchers</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-r </B><I>tag</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
<A NAME="ixABT"></A>
<A NAME="ixABU"></A>
Use the revision specified by the <I>tag</I> argument instead of the
default <I>head</I> revision.  As well as arbitrary tags defined
with the <B>tag</B> or <B>rtag</B> command, two special tags are
always available: <B>HEAD</B> refers to the most recent version
available in the repository, and <B>BASE</B> refers to the
revision you last checked out into the current working directory.

<P>



The tag specification is sticky when you use this
with <B>checkout</B> or <B>update</B> to make your own
copy of a file: <B>cvs</B> remembers the tag and continues to use it on
future update commands, until you specify otherwise (for more information
on sticky tags/dates, see node `Sticky tagsaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



The tag can be either a symbolic or numeric tag, as
described in see node `Tagsaq in the CVS manual, or the name of a branch, as
described in see node `Branching and mergingaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



Specifying the <B>-q</B> global option along with the
<B>-r</B> command option is often useful, to suppress
the warning messages when the <B>rcs</B> file
does not contain the specified tag.

<P>



<B>Note: this is not the same as the overall cvs -r option,
which you can specify to the left of a cvs command!</B>

This can be used in conjunction with the

<DT><DD>
<B>-n</B><I>name</I><B>[:[</B><I>rev</I><B>]]</B>
<DT><DD>
Associate the symbolic name <I>name</I> with the branch
or revision <I>rev</I>.  It is normally better to use
<B>cvs tag</B> or <B>cvs rtag</B> instead.  Delete the
symbolic name if both <B>:</B> and <I>rev</I> are
omitted; otherwise, print an error message if
<I>name</I> is already associated with another number.
If <I>rev</I> is symbolic, it is expanded before
association.  A <I>rev</I> consisting of a branch number
followed by a <B>.</B> stands for the current latest
revision in the branch.  A <B>:</B> with an empty
<I>rev</I> stands for the current latest revision on the
default branch, normally the trunk.  For example,
<B>cvs admin -n</B><I>name</I><B>:</B> associates <I>name</I> with the
current latest revision of all the RCS files;
this contrasts with <B>cvs admin -n</B><I>name</I><B>:$</B> which
associates <I>name</I> with the revision numbers
extracted from keyword strings in the corresponding
working files.

Note that this command can be quite dangerous unless
you know <I>exactly</I> what you are doing (for example
see the warnings below about how the
<I>rev1</I>:<I>rev2</I> syntax is confusing).

<P>



If you are short on disc this option might help you.
But think twice before using it---there is no way short
of restoring the latest backup to undo this command!
If you delete different revisions than you planned,
either due to carelessness or (heaven forbid) a <B>cvs</B>
bug, there is no opportunity to correct the error
before the revisions are deleted.  It probably would be
a good idea to experiment on a copy of the repository
first.

<P>



Specify <I>range</I> in one of the following ways:

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B></B><I>rev1</I><B>::</B><I>rev2</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Collapse all revisions between rev1 and rev2, so that
<B>cvs</B> only stores the differences associated with going
from rev1 to rev2, not intermediate steps.  For
example, after <B>-o 1.3::1.5</B> one can retrieve
revision 1.3, revision 1.5, or the differences to get
from 1.3 to 1.5, but not the revision 1.4, or the
differences between 1.3 and 1.4.  Other examples:
<B>-o 1.3::1.4</B> and <B>-o 1.3::1.3</B> have no
effect, because there are no intermediate revisions to
remove.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>::</B><I>rev</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Collapse revisions between the beginning of the branch
containing <I>rev</I> and <I>rev</I> itself.  The
branchpoint and <I>rev</I> are left intact.  For
example, <B>-o ::1.3.2.6</B> deletes revision 1.3.2.1,
revision 1.3.2.5, and everything in between, but leaves
1.3 and 1.3.2.6 intact.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B></B><I>rev</I><B>::</B>
<DT><DD>
Collapse revisions between <I>rev</I> and the end of the
branch containing <I>rev</I>.  Revision <I>rev</I> is
left intact but the head revision is deleted.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B></B><I>rev</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Delete the revision <I>rev</I>.  For example, <B>-o
1.3</B> is equivalent to <B>-o 1.2::1.4</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B></B><I>rev1</I><B>:</B><I>rev2</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Delete the revisions from <I>rev1</I> to <I>rev2</I>,
inclusive, on the same branch.  One will not be able to
retrieve <I>rev1</I> or <I>rev2</I> or any of the
revisions in between.  For example, the command
<B>cvs admin -oR_1_01:R_1_02 .</B> is rarely useful.
It means to delete revisions up to, and including, the
tag R_1_02.  But beware!  If there are files that have not
changed between R_1_02 and R_1_03 the file will have
<I>the same</I> numerical revision number assigned to
the tags R_1_02 and R_1_03.  So not only will it be
impossible to retrieve R_1_02; R_1_03 will also have to
be restored from the tapes!  In most cases you want to
specify <I>rev1</I>::<I>rev2</I> instead.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>:</B><I>rev</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Delete revisions from the beginning of the
branch containing <I>rev</I> up to and including
<I>rev</I>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B></B><I>rev</I><B>:</B>
<DT><DD>
Delete revisions from revision <I>rev</I>, including
<I>rev</I> itself, to the end of the branch containing
<I>rev</I>.

<P>



None of the revisions to be deleted may have
branches or locks.

<P>



If any of the revisions to be deleted have symbolic
names, and one specifies one of the <B>::</B> syntaxes,
then <B>cvs</B> will give an error and not delete any
revisions.  If you really want to delete both the
symbolic names and the revisions, first delete the
symbolic names with <B>cvs tag -d</B>, then run
<B>cvs admin -o</B>.  If one specifies the
non-<B>::</B> syntaxes, then <B>cvs</B> will delete the
revisions but leave the symbolic names pointing to
nonexistent revisions.  This behavior is preserved for
compatibility with previous versions of <B>cvs</B>, but
because it isnaqt very useful, in the future it may
change to be like the <B>::</B> case.

<P>



Due to the way <B>cvs</B> handles branches <I>rev</I>
cannot be specified symbolically if it is a branch.
see node `Magic branch numbersaq in the CVS manual, for an explanation.

<P>



Make sure that no-one has checked out a copy of the
revision you outdate.  Strange things will happen if he
starts to edit it and tries to check it back in.  For
this reason, this option is not a good way to take back
a bogus commit; commit a new revision undoing the bogus
change instead (see node `Merging two revisionsaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-q</B>
<DT><DD>
Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-s</B><I>state</I><B>[:</B><I>rev</I><B>]</B>
<DT><DD>
Useful with <B>cvs</B>.  Set the state attribute of the
revision <I>rev</I> to <I>state</I>.  If <I>rev</I> is a
branch number, assume the latest revision on that
branch.  If <I>rev</I> is omitted, assume the latest
revision on the default branch.  Any identifier is
acceptable for <I>state</I>.  A useful set of states is
<B>Exp</B> (for experimental), <B>Stab</B> (for
stable), and <B>Rel</B> (for released).  By default,
the state of a new revision is set to <B>Exp</B> when
it is created.  The state is visible in the output from
<I>cvs log</I> (see node `logaq in the CVS manual), and in the
<B>$</B>Log$ and <B>$</B>State$ keywords
(see node `Keyword substitutionaq in the CVS manual).  Note that <B>cvs</B>
uses the <B>dead</B> state for its own purposes; to
take a file to or from the <B>dead</B> state use
commands like <B>cvs remove</B> and <B>cvs add</B>, not
<B>cvs admin -s</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-t[</B><I>file</I><B>]</B>
<DT><DD>
Useful with <B>cvs</B>.  Write descriptive text from the
contents of the named <I>file</I> into the RCS file,
deleting the existing text.  The <I>file</I> pathname
may not begin with <B>-</B>.  The descriptive text can be seen in the
output from <B>cvs log</B> (see node `logaq in the CVS manual).
There can be no space between <B>-t</B> and its argument.

<P>



If <I>file</I> is omitted,
obtain the text from standard input, terminated by
end-of-file or by a line containing <B>.</B> by itself.
Prompt for the text if interaction is possible; see
<B>-I</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-t-</B><I>string</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Similar to <B>-t</B><I>file</I><B></B>. Write descriptive text
from the <I>string</I> into the <B>rcs</B> file, deleting
the existing text.
There can be no space between <B>-t</B> and its argument.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-U</B>
<DT><DD>
Set locking to non-strict.  Non-strict locking means
that the owner of a file need not lock a revision for
checkin.  For use with <B>cvs</B>, strict locking must be
set; see the discussion under the <B>-l</B> option
above.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-u[</B><I>rev</I><B>]</B>
<DT><DD>
See the option <B>-l</B> above, for a discussion of
using this option with <B>cvs</B>.  Unlock the revision
with number <I>rev</I>.  If a branch is given, unlock
the latest revision on that branch.  If <I>rev</I> is
omitted, remove the latest lock held by the caller.
Normally, only the locker of a revision may unlock it;
somebody else unlocking a revision breaks the lock.
This causes the original locker to be sent a <B>commit</B>
notification (see node `Getting Notifiedaq in the CVS manual).
There can be no space between <B>-u</B> and its argument.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-V</B><I>n</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
In previous versions of <B>cvs</B>, this option meant to
write an <B>rcs</B> file which would be acceptable to
<B>rcs</B> version <I>n</I>, but it is now obsolete and
specifying it will produce an error.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-x</B><I>suffixes</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
In previous versions of <B>cvs</B>, this was documented
as a way of specifying the names of the <B>rcs</B>
files.  However, <B>cvs</B> has always required that the
<B>rcs</B> files used by <B>cvs</B> end in <B>,v</B>, so
this option has never done anything useful.

Synopsis: checkout [options] modules...
<DT>*<DD>
Requires: repository.
<DT>*<DD>
Changes: working directory.
<DT>*<DD>
Synonyms: co, get

<P>



Create or update a working directory containing copies of the
source files specified by <I>modules</I>.  You must execute
<B>checkout</B> before using most of the other <B>cvs</B>
commands, since most of them operate on your working
directory.

<P>



The <I>modules</I> are either
symbolic names for some
collection of source directories and files, or paths to
directories or files in the repository.  The symbolic
names are defined in the <B>modules</B> file.
see node `modulesaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



Depending on the modules you specify, <B>checkout</B> may
recursively create directories and populate them with
the appropriate source files.  You can then edit these
source files at any time (regardless of whether other
software developers are editing their own copies of the
sources); update them to include new changes applied by
others to the source repository; or commit your work as
a permanent change to the source repository.

<P>



Note that <B>checkout</B> is used to create
directories.  The top-level directory created is always
added to the directory where <B>checkout</B> is
invoked, and usually has the same name as the specified
module.  In the case of a module alias, the created
sub-directory may have a different name, but you can be
sure that it will be a sub-directory, and that
<B>checkout</B> will show the relative path leading to
each file as it is extracted into your private work
area (unless you specify the <B>-Q</B> global option).

<P>



The files created by <B>checkout</B> are created
read-write, unless the <B>-r</B> option to <B>cvs</B>
(see node `Global optionsaq in the CVS manual) is specified, the
<B>CVSREAD</B> environment variable is specified
(see node `Environment variablesaq in the CVS manual), or a watch is in
effect for that file (see node `Watchesaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



Note that running <B>checkout</B> on a directory that was already
built by a prior <B>checkout</B> is also permitted.
This is similar to specifying the <B>-d</B> option
to the <B>update</B> command in the sense that new
directories that have been created in the repository
will appear in your work area.
However, <B>checkout</B> takes a module name whereas
<B>update</B> takes a directory name.  Also
to use <B>checkout</B> this way it must be run from the
top level directory (where you originally ran
<B>checkout</B> from), so before you run
<B>checkout</B> to update an existing directory, donaqt
forget to change your directory to the top level
directory.

<DT><DD>
<B>-c</B>
<DT><DD>
Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output,
instead of creating or modifying any files or
directories in your working directory.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-d </B><I>dir</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Create a directory called <I>dir</I> for the working
files, instead of using the module name.  In general,
using this flag is equivalent to using <B>mkdir
</B><I>dir</I><B>; cd </B><I>dir</I><B></B> followed by the checkout
command without the <B>-d</B> flag.

<P>



There is an important exception, however.  It is very
convenient when checking out a single item to have the
output appear in a directory that doesnaqt contain empty
intermediate directories.  In this case <I>only</I>,
<B>cvs</B> tries to ``shortenaqaq pathnames to avoid those empty
directories.

<P>



For example, given a module <B>foo</B> that contains
the file <B>bar.c</B>, the command <B>cvs co -d dir
foo</B> will create directory <B>dir</B> and place
<B>bar.c</B> inside.  Similarly, given a module
<B>bar</B> which has subdirectory <B>baz</B> wherein
there is a file <B>quux.c</B>, the command <B>cvs co
-d dir bar/baz</B> will create directory <B>dir</B> and
place <B>quux.c</B> inside.

<P>



Using the <B>-N</B> flag will defeat this behavior.
Given the same module definitions above, <B>cvs co
-N -d dir foo</B> will create directories <B>dir/foo</B>
and place <B>bar.c</B> inside, while <B>cvs co -N -d
dir bar/baz</B> will create directories <B>dir/bar/baz</B>
and place <B>quux.c</B> inside.

<B>-j </B><I>tag</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
With two <B>-j</B> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <B>-j</B> option to
the revision specified with the second <B>j</B> option,
into the working directory.

<P>



With one <B>-j</B> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<B>-j</B> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <B>-j</B> option.

<P>



In addition, each -j option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<B>-j</B><I>Symbolic_Tag</I><B>:</B><I>Date_Specifier</I><B></B>.

Only useful together with <B>-d </B><I>dir</I><B></B>.  With
this option, <B>cvs</B> will not ``shortenaqaq module paths

discussion.

<A NAME="ixACJ"></A>

<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Synopsis: commit [-lnRf] [-m aqlog_messageaq |
-F file] [-r revision] [files...]
<DT>*<DD>
Requires: working directory, repository.
<DT>*<DD>
Changes: repository.
<DT>*<DD>
Synonym: ci

<P>



Use <B>commit</B> when you want to incorporate changes
from your working source files into the source
repository.

<P>



If you donaqt specify particular files to commit, all of
the files in your working current directory are
examined.  <B>commit</B> is careful to change in the
repository only those files that you have really
changed.  By default (or if you explicitly specify the
<B>-R</B> option), files in subdirectories are also
examined and committed if they have changed; you can
use the <B>-l</B> option to limit <B>commit</B> to the
current directory only.

<P>



<B>commit</B> verifies that the selected files are up
to date with the current revisions in the source
repository; it will notify you, and exit without
committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with <B>update</B> (see node `updateaq in the CVS manual).
<B>commit</B> does not call the <B>update</B> command
for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when the
time is right.

<P>



When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to
enter a log message that will be written to one or more
logging programs (see node `modulesaq in the CVS manual, and see node `loginfoaq in the CVS manual)
and placed in the <B>rcs</B> file inside the
repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the
<B>log</B> command; see see node `logaq in the CVS manual.  You can specify the
log message on the command line with the <B>-m
</B><I>message</I><B></B> option, and thus avoid the editor invocation,
or use the <B>-F </B><I>file</I><B></B> option to specify
that the argument file contains the log message.

<H2>commit options</H2>


<P>



These standard options are supported by <B>commit</B>
(see node `Common optionsaq in the CVS manual, for a complete description of
them):

<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>-l</B>
<DT><DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-R</B>
<DT><DD>
Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-r </B><I>revision</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Commit to <I>revision</I>.  <I>revision</I> must be
either a branch, or a revision on the main trunk that
is higher than any existing revision number
(see node `Assigning revisionsaq in the CVS manual).  You
cannot commit to a specific revision on a branch.

<P>



<B>commit</B> also supports these options:

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-F </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Read the log message from <I>file</I>, instead
of invoking an editor.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-f</B>
<DT><DD>
Note that this is not the standard behavior of
the <B>-f</B> option as defined in see node `Common optionsaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



Force <B>cvs</B> to commit a new revision even if you havenaqt
made any changes to the file.  If the current revision
of <I>file</I> is 1.7, then the following two commands
are equivalent:

<P>





<P>



<DT><DD>
$ cvs commit -f <I>file</I>
<DT><DD>
$ cvs commit -r 1.8 <I>file</I>
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



The <B>-f</B> option disables recursion (i.e., it
implies <B>-l</B>).  To force <B>cvs</B> to commit a new
revision for all files in all subdirectories, you must
use <B>-f -R</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-m </B><I>message</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Use <I>message</I> as the log message, instead of
invoking an editor.

<H3>Committing to a branch</H3>


<P>



You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an
even number of dots) with the <B>-r</B> option.  To
create a branch revision, use the <B>-b</B> option
of the <B>rtag</B> or <B>tag</B> commands
(see node `Branching and mergingaq in the CVS manual).  Then, either <B>checkout</B> or
<B>update</B> can be used to base your sources on the
newly created branch.  From that point on, all
<B>commit</B> changes made within these working sources
will be automatically added to a branch revision,
thereby not disturbing main-line development in any
way.  For example, if you had to create a patch to the
1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version
is already under development, you might do:

<P>





<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
$ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
<DT><DD>
$ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
<DT><DD>
$ cd product_module
<DT><DD>
[[ hack away ]]
<DT><DD>
$ cvs commit
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



This works automatically since the <B>-r</B> option is
sticky.

<P>



</DL>
<A NAME="lbBF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Creating the branch after editing</H3>


<P>



Say you have been working on some extremely
experimental software, based on whatever revision you
happened to checkout last week.  If others in your
group would like to work on this software with you, but
without disturbing main-line development, you could
commit your change to a new branch.  Others can then
checkout your experimental stuff and utilize the full
benefit of <B>cvs</B> conflict resolution.  The scenario might
look like:

<P>





<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
<DT><DD>
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
<DT><DD>
$ cvs update -r EXPR1
<DT><DD>
$ cvs commit
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



The <B>update</B> command will make the <B>-r
EXPR1</B> option sticky on all files.  Note that your
changes to the files will never be removed by the
<B>update</B> command.  The <B>commit</B> will
automatically commit to the correct branch, because the
<B>-r</B> is sticky.  You could also do like this:

<P>





<P>



<DT><DD>
[[ hacked sources are present ]]
<DT><DD>
$ cvs tag -b EXPR1
<DT><DD>
$ cvs commit -r EXPR1
<P>

<DT><DD>

<P>



but then, only those files that were changed by you
will have the <B>-r EXPR1</B> sticky flag.  If you hack
away, and commit without specifying the <B>-r EXPR1</B>
flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
trunk.

<P>



To work with you on the experimental change, others
would simply do

<P>





<P>



<DT><DD>
$ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module
<P>

<DT><DD>

<DT><DD>
<B>-r </B><I>tag</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Compare with revision <I>tag</I>.  Zero, one or two
<B>-r</B> options can be present.  With no <B>-r</B>
option, the working file will be compared with the
revision it was based on.  With one <B>-r</B>, that
revision will be compared to your current working file.
With two <B>-r</B> options those two revisions will be
compared (and your working file will not affect the
outcome in any way).

<P>



One or both <B>-r</B> options can be replaced by a
<B>-D </B><I>date</I><B></B> option, described above.

<P>



The following options specify the format of the
output.  They have the same meaning as in GNU diff.
Most options have two equivalent names, one of which is a single letter
preceded by <B>-</B>, and the other of which is a long name preceded by
<B>--</B>.

<H2>Line group formats</H2>


<P>



Line group formats let you specify formats suitable for many
applications that allow if-then-else input, including programming
languages and text formatting languages.  A line group format specifies
the output format for a contiguous group of similar lines.

For example, the following command compares the TeX file <B>myfile</B>
with the original version from the repository,
and outputs a merged file in which old regions are
surrounded by <B>\begin{em}</B>-<B>\end{em}</B> lines, and new
regions are surrounded by <B>\begin{bf}</B>-<B>\end{bf}</B> lines.

To specify a line group format, use one of the options
listed below.  You can specify up to four line group formats, one for
each kind of line group.  You should quote <I>format</I>, because it
typically contains shell metacharacters.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>--old-group-format=</B><I>format</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the first file.
The default old group format is the same as the changed group format if
it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the line group as-is.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>--new-group-format=</B><I>format</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the second
file.  The default new group format is same as the changed group
format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format that outputs the
line group as-is.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>--changed-group-format=</B><I>format</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
These line groups are hunks containing lines from both files.  The
default changed group format is the concatenation of the old and new
group formats.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>--unchanged-group-format=</B><I>format</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
These line groups contain lines common to both files.  The default
unchanged group format is a format that outputs the line group as-is.

<P>



In a line group format, ordinary characters represent themselves;
conversion specifications start with <B>%</B> and have one of the
following forms.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%&lt;</B>
<DT><DD>
stands for the lines from the first file, including the trailing newline.
Each line is formatted according to the old line format (see node `Line formatsaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%&gt;</B>
<DT><DD>
stands for the lines from the second file, including the trailing newline.
Each line is formatted according to the new line format.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%=</B>
<DT><DD>
stands for the lines common to both files, including the trailing newline.
Each line is formatted according to the unchanged line format.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%%</B>
<DT><DD>
stands for <B>%</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%caq</B><I>C</I><B>aq</B>
<DT><DD>
where <I>C</I> is a single character, stands for <I>C</I>.
<I>C</I> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe.
For example, <B>%caq:aq</B> stands for a colon, even inside
the then-part of an if-then-else format, which a colon would
normally terminate.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%caq\</B><I>O</I><B>aq</B>
<DT><DD>
where <I>O</I> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits,
stands for the character with octal code <I>O</I>.
For example, <B>%caq\0aq</B> stands for a null character.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B></B><I>F</I><B></B><I>n</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
where <I>F</I> is a <B>printf</B> conversion specification and <I>n</I> is one
of the following letters, stands for <I>n</I>aqs value formatted with <I>F</I>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>e</B>
<DT><DD>
The line number of the line just before the group in the old file.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>f</B>
<DT><DD>
The line number of the first line in the group in the old file;
equals <I>e</I> + 1.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>l</B>
<DT><DD>
The line number of the last line in the group in the old file.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>m</B>
<DT><DD>
The line number of the line just after the group in the old file;
equals <I>l</I> + 1.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>n</B>
<DT><DD>
The number of lines in the group in the old file; equals <I>l</I> - <I>f</I> + 1.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>E, F, L, M, N</B>
<DT><DD>
Likewise, for lines in the new file.

<P>




<P>



The <B>printf</B> conversion specification can be <B>%d</B>,
<B>%o</B>, <B>%x</B>, or <B>%X</B>, specifying decimal, octal,
lower case hexadecimal, or upper case hexadecimal output
respectively.  After the <B>%</B> the following options can appear in
sequence: a <B>-</B> specifying left-justification; an integer
specifying the minimum field width; and a period followed by an
optional integer specifying the minimum number of digits.
For example, <B>%5dN</B> prints the number of new lines in the group
in a field of width 5 characters, using the <B>printf</B> format <B>&quot;%5d&quot;</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>(</B><I>A</I><B>=</B><I>B</I><B>?</B><I>T</I><B>:</B><I>E</I><B>)</B>
<DT><DD>
If <I>A</I> equals <I>B</I> then <I>T</I> else <I>E</I>.
<I>A</I> and <I>B</I> are each either a decimal constant
or a single letter interpreted as above.
This format spec is equivalent to <I>T</I> if
<I>A</I>aqs value equals <I>B</I>aqs; otherwise it is equivalent to <I>E</I>.

<P>



For example, <B>%(N=0?no:%dN) line%(N=1?:s)</B> is equivalent to
<B>no lines</B> if <I>N</I> (the number of lines in the group in the
new file) is 0, to <B>1 line</B> if <I>N</I> is 1, and to <B>%dN lines</B>
otherwise.

<H2>Line formats</H2>


<P>



Line formats control how each line taken from an input file is
output as part of a line group in if-then-else format.

<P>



For example, the following command outputs text with a one-column
change indicator to the left of the text.  The first column of output
is <B>-</B> for deleted lines, <B>|</B> for added lines, and a space
for unchanged lines.  The formats contain newline characters where
newlines are desired on output.

To specify a line format, use one of the following options.  You should
quote <I>format</I>, since it often contains shell metacharacters.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>--old-line-format=</B><I>format</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
formats lines just from the first file.

<P>



<DT><DD>

<DT><DD>
formats lines just from the second file.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>--unchanged-line-format=</B><I>format</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
formats lines common to both files.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>--line-format=</B><I>format</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
formats all lines; in effect, it sets all three above options simultaneously.

<P>



In a line format, ordinary characters represent themselves;
conversion specifications start with <B>%</B> and have one of the
following forms.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%l</B>
<DT><DD>
stands for the contents of the line, not counting its trailing
newline (if any).  This format ignores whether the line is incomplete.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%L</B>
<DT><DD>
stands for the contents of the line, including its trailing newline
(if any).  If a line is incomplete, this format preserves its
incompleteness.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%%</B>
<DT><DD>
stands for <B>%</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%caq</B><I>C</I><B>aq</B>
<DT><DD>
where <I>C</I> is a single character, stands for <I>C</I>.
<I>C</I> may not be a backslash or an apostrophe.
For example, <B>%caq:aq</B> stands for a colon.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>%caq\</B><I>O</I><B>aq</B>
<DT><DD>
where <I>O</I> is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits,
stands for the character with octal code <I>O</I>.
For example, <B>%caq\0aq</B> stands for a null character.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B></B><I>F</I><B>n</B>
<DT><DD>
where <I>F</I> is a <B>printf</B> conversion specification,
stands for the line number formatted with <I>F</I>.
For example, <B>%.5dn</B> prints the line number using the
<B>printf</B> format <B>&quot;%.5d&quot;</B>.  see node `Line group formatsaq in the CVS manual, for
more about printf conversion specifications.

<P>




<P>



The default line format is <B>%l</B> followed by a newline character.

<P>



If the input contains tab characters and it is important that they line
up on output, you should ensure that <B>%l</B> or <B>%L</B> in a line
format is just after a tab stop (e.g. by preceding <B>%l</B> or
<B>%L</B> with a tab character), or you should use the <B>-t</B> or
<B>--expand-tabs</B> option.

<P>



Taken together, the line and line group formats let you specify many
different formats.  For example, the following command uses a format
similar to <B>diff</B>aqs normal format.  You can tailor this command
to get fine control over <B>diff</B>aqs output.

<DT>*<DD>
Requires: repository.
<DT>*<DD>
Changes: current directory.

<P>



This command is a variant of <B>checkout</B>; use it
when you want a copy of the source for module without
the <B>cvs</B> administrative directories.  For example, you
might use <B>export</B> to prepare source for shipment
off-site.  This command requires that you specify a
date or tag (with <B>-D</B> or <B>-r</B>), so that you
can count on reproducing the source you ship to others
(and thus it always prunes empty directories).

<P>



One often would like to use <B>-kv</B> with <B>cvs
export</B>.  This causes any keywords to be
expanded such that an import done at some other site
will not lose the keyword revision information.  But be
aware that doesnaqt handle an export containing binary
files correctly.  Also be aware that after having used
<B>-kv</B>, one can no longer use the <B>ident</B>
command (which is part of the <B>rcs</B> suite---see
<A HREF="../man1/ident.1.php">ident</A>(1)) which looks for keyword strings.  If
you want to be able to use <B>ident</B> you must not

<DT><DD>
Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time
the repository was modified).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-e</B>
<DT><DD>
Everything (all record types).  Equivalent to
specifying <B>-x</B> with all record types.  Of course,
<B>-e</B> will also include record types which are
added in a future version of <B>cvs</B>; if you are
writing a script which can only handle certain record
types, youaqll want to specify <B>-x</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-m </B><I>module</I><B></B>

Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully
use <B>-m</B> more than once on the command line.)

<DT><DD>
<B>-o</B>
<DT><DD>
Report on checked-out modules.  This is the default report type.

<B>C</B>
<DT><DD>
A merge was necessary but collisions were
detected (requiring manual merging).
<DT><DD>
<B>G</B>

<DT><DD>
<B>P</B>
<DT><DD>
A working file was patched to match the repository.
<DT><DD>
<B>W</B>
<DT><DD>
The working copy of a file was deleted during
update (because it was gone from the repository).

<P>



One of three record types results from commit:

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>A</B>
<DT><DD>
A file was added for the first time.
<DT><DD>
<B>M</B>
<DT><DD>
A file was modified.
<DT><DD>
<B>R</B>
<DT><DD>
A file was removed.

<P>



The options shown as <B>-flags</B> constrain or expand
the report without requiring option arguments:

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-a</B>
<DT><DD>
Show data for all users (the default is to show data
only for the user executing <B>history</B>).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-l</B>
<DT><DD>
Show last modification only.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-w</B>
<DT><DD>
Show only the records for modifications done from the
same working directory where <B>history</B> is
executing.

<P>



The options shown as <B>-options </B><I>args</I><B></B> constrain the report
based on an argument:

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-b </B><I>str</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Show data back to a record containing  the  string
<I>str</I>  in  either the module name, the file name, or
the repository path.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-D </B><I>date</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Show data since <I>date</I>.  This is slightly different
from the normal use of <B>-D </B><I>date</I><B></B>, which
selects the newest revision older than <I>date</I>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-f </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Show data for a particular file
(you can specify several <B>-f</B> options on the same command line).
This is equivalent to specifying the file on the command line.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-n </B><I>module</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Show data for a particular module
(you can specify several <B>-n</B> options on the same command line).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-p </B><I>repository</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Show data for a particular source repository  (you
can specify several <B>-p</B> options on the same command
line).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-r </B><I>rev</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Show records referring to revisions since the revision
or tag named <I>rev</I> appears in individual <B>rcs</B>
files.  Each <B>rcs</B> file is searched for the revision or
tag.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-t </B><I>tag</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Show records since tag <I>tag</I> was last added to the
history file.  This differs from the <B>-r</B> flag
above in that it reads only the history file, not the
<B>rcs</B> files, and is much faster.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-u </B><I>name</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>

<H3>Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches</H3>

<A NAME="ixACN"></A>

<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...
<DT>*<DD>
Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.
<DT>*<DD>
Changes: repository.

<P>



Use <B>import</B> to incorporate an entire source
distribution from an outside source (e.g., a source
vendor) into your source repository directory.  You can
use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module
from the outside source.  see node `Tracking sourcesaq in the CVS manual, for
a discussion on this subject.

<P>



The <I>repository</I> argument gives a directory name
(or a path to a directory) under the <B>cvs</B> root directory
for repositories; if the directory did not exist,
import creates it.

<P>



When you use import for updates to source that has been
modified in your source repository (since a prior
import), it will notify you of any files that conflict
in the two branches of development; use <B>checkout
-j</B> to reconcile the differences, as import instructs
you to do.

<P>



If <B>cvs</B> decides a file should be ignored
(see node `cvsignoreaq in the CVS manual), it does not import it and prints
<B>I </B> followed by the filename (see node `import outputaq in the CVS manual, for a
complete description of the output).

<P>



If the file <B>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers</B> exists,
any file whose names match the specifications in that
file will be treated as packages and the appropriate
filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported.  see node `Wrappersaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



The outside source is saved in a first-level
branch, by default 1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this
branch; for example, files from the first imported
collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision
1.1.1.2, and so on.

<P>



At least three arguments are required.
<I>repository</I> is needed to identify the collection
of source.  <I>vendortag</I> is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at
least one <I>releasetag</I> to identify the files at
the leaves created each time you execute <B>import</B>.

<P>



Note that <B>import</B> does <I>not</I> change the
directory in which you invoke it.  In particular, it
does not set up that directory as a <B>cvs</B> working
directory; if you want to work with the sources import
them first and then check them out into a different
directory (see node `Getting the sourceaq in the CVS manual).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-k </B><I>subst</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Indicate the keyword expansion mode desired.  This
setting will apply to all files created during the
import, but not to any files that previously existed in
the repository.  See see node `Substitution modesaq in the CVS manual, for a
list of valid <B>-k</B> settings.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-I </B><I>name</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Specify file names that should be ignored during

ignoring any files at all (even those ignored by
default), specify `-I !aq.

<P>



<I>name</I> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <B>.cvsignore</B> file.

<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>

modified; a new revision has been created (if necessary).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>N </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>C </B><I>file</I><B></B>

The file already exists in the repository but has been locally modified;
you will have to merge the changes.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>I </B><I>file</I><B></B>

<P>



Display log information for files.  <B>log</B> used to
call the <B>rcs</B> utility <B>rlog</B>.  Although this

things.  For each revision, the revision number, the
author, the number of lines added/deleted and the log
message are printed.  All times are displayed in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  (Other parts of
<B>cvs</B> print times in the local timezone).

<P>



Builds a Larry Wall format <A HREF="../man1/patch.1.php">patch</A>(1) file between two
releases, that can be fed directly into the <B>patch</B>
program to bring an old release up-to-date with the new
release.  (This is one of the few <B>cvs</B> commands that
operates directly from the repository, and doesnaqt
require a prior checkout.) The diff output is sent to
the standard output device.

<P>



You can specify (using the standard <B>-r</B> and
<B>-D</B> options) any combination of one or two
revisions or dates.  If only one revision or date is
specified, the patch file reflects differences between
that revision or date and the current head revisions in
the <B>rcs</B> file.

<P>



Note that if the software release affected is contained
in more than one directory, then it may be necessary to
specify the <B>-p</B> option to the <B>patch</B> command when
patching the old sources, so that <B>patch</B> is able to find
the files that are located in other directories.

<DT><DD>
Create a summary change report instead of a patch.  The
summary includes information about files that were

the standard output device.  This is useful for finding
out, for example, which files have changed between two
dates or revisions.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-t</B>
<DT><DD>
A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard

last change to a file was.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-u</B>
<DT><DD>
Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.
Remember that old versions
of the <B>patch</B> program canaqt handle the unidiff
format, so if you plan to post this patch to the net
you should probably not use <B>-u</B>.

This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of
<B>cvs checkout</B>.  Since <B>cvs</B> doesnaqt lock files, it
isnaqt strictly necessary to use this command.  You can
always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have
forgotten, and you leave no trace in the <B>cvs</B> history
file (see node `history fileaq in the CVS manual) that youaqve abandoned your
checkout.

<P>



Use <B>cvs release</B> to avoid these problems.  This
command checks that no uncommitted changes are
present; that you are executing it from immediately
above a <B>cvs</B> working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository
defined in the module database.

<P>

</B><I>tag</I><B></B> flags.  If no matching revision is found,
retrieve the most recent revision (instead of ignoring
the file).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-k </B><I>kflag</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Process keywords according to <I>kflag</I>.  See
see node `Keyword substitutionaq in the CVS manual.
This option is sticky; future updates of
this file in this working directory will use the same
<I>kflag</I>.  The <B>status</B> command can be viewed
to see the sticky options.  See see node `Invoking CVSaq in the CVS manual, for
more information on the <B>status</B> command.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-l</B>
<DT><DD>
Local; run only in current working directory.  see node `Recursive behavioraq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-P</B>
<DT><DD>
Prune empty directories.  See see node `Moving directoriesaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-p</B>
<DT><DD>
Pipe files to the standard output.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-R</B>
<DT><DD>
Update directories recursively (default).  see node `Recursive
behavioraq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-r rev</B>
<DT><DD>
Retrieve revision/tag <I>rev</I>.  This option is sticky,
and implies <B>-P</B>.
See see node `Sticky tagsaq in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<P>



These special options are also available with
<B>update</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-A</B>
<DT><DD>
Reset any sticky tags, dates, or <B>-k</B> options.
See see node `Sticky tagsaq in the CVS manual, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-C</B>
<DT><DD>
Overwrite locally modified files with clean copies from
the repository (the modified file is saved in
<B>.#</B><I>file</I><B>.</B><I>revision</I><B></B>, however).

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-d</B>
<DT><DD>
Create any directories that exist in the repository if
theyaqre missing from the working directory.  Normally,
<B>update</B> acts only on directories and files that
were already enrolled in your working directory.

<P>



This is useful for updating directories that were
created in the repository since the initial checkout;
but it has an unfortunate side effect.  If you
deliberately avoided certain directories in the
repository when you created your working directory
(either through use of a module name or by listing
explicitly the files and directories you wanted on the
command line), then updating with <B>-d</B> will create
those directories, which may not be what you want.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-I </B><I>name</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Ignore files whose names match <I>name</I> (in your
working directory) during the update.  You can specify
<B>-I</B> more than once on the command line to specify
several files to ignore.  Use <B>-I !</B> to avoid
ignoring any files at all.  see node `cvsignoreaq in the CVS manual, for other
ways to make <B>cvs</B> ignore some files.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-W</B><I>spec</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Specify file names that should be filtered during
update.  You can use this option repeatedly.

<P>



<I>spec</I> can be a file name pattern of the same type
that you can specify in the <B>.cvswrappers</B>
file. see node `Wrappersaq in the CVS manual.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>-j</B><I>revision</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
With two <B>-j</B> options, merge changes from the
revision specified with the first <B>-j</B> option to
the revision specified with the second <B>j</B> option,
into the working directory.

<P>



With one <B>-j</B> option, merge changes from the
ancestor revision to the revision specified with the
<B>-j</B> option, into the working directory.  The
ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
revision which the working directory is based on, and
the revision specified in the <B>-j</B> option.

<P>



Note that using a single <B>-j </B><I>tagname</I><B></B> option rather than
<B>-j </B><I>branchname</I><B></B> to merge changes from a branch will
often not remove files which were removed on the branch.
see node `Merging adds and removalsaq in the CVS manual, for more.

<P>



In addition, each <B>-j</B> option can contain an optional
date specification which, when used with branches, can
limit the chosen revision to one within a specific
date.  An optional date is specified by adding a colon
(:) to the tag:
<B>-j</B><I>Symbolic_Tag</I><B>:</B><I>Date_Specifier</I><B></B>.

<P>



see node `Branching and mergingaq in the CVS manual.

<H2>update output</H2>


<P>



<B>update</B> and <B>checkout</B> keep you informed of
their progress by printing a line for each file, preceded
by one character indicating the status of the file:

<P>



<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>U </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
The file was brought up to date with respect to the
repository.  This is done for any file that exists in
the repository but not in your source, and for files
that you havenaqt changed but are not the most recent
versions available in the repository.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>P </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
Like <B>U</B>, but the <B>cvs</B> server sends a patch instead of an entire
file.  This accomplishes the same thing as <B>U</B> using less bandwidth.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>A </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
The file has been added to your private copy of the
sources, and will be added to the source repository
when you run <B>commit</B> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>R </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
The file has been removed from your private copy of the
sources, and will be removed from the source repository
when you run <B>commit</B> on the file.  This is a
reminder to you that the file needs to be committed.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>M </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

<P>



<B>M</B> can indicate one of two states for a file
youaqre working on: either there were no modifications
to the same file in the repository, so that your file
remains as you last saw it; or there were modifications
in the repository as well as in your copy, but they
were merged successfully, without conflict, in your
working directory.

<P>



<B>cvs</B> will print some messages if it merges your work,
and a backup copy of your working file (as it looked
before you ran <B>update</B>) will be made.  The exact
name of that file is printed while <B>update</B> runs.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>C </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
<A NAME="ixACW"></A>
<A NAME="ixACX"></A>
A conflict was detected while trying to merge your
changes to <I>file</I> with changes from the source
repository.  <I>file</I> (the copy in your working
directory) is now the result of attempting to merge
the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file
is also in your working directory, with the name
<B>.#</B><I>file</I><B>.</B><I>revision</I><B></B> where <I>revision</I>
is the revision that your modified file started
from.  Resolve the conflict as described in
see node `Conflicts exampleaq in the CVS manual.
(Note that some systems automatically purge
files that begin with <B>.#</B> if they have not been
accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep a copy
of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
it.)  Under <B>vms</B>, the file name starts with
<B>__</B> rather than <B>.#</B>.

<P>



<DT><DD>
<B>? </B><I>file</I><B></B>
<DT><DD>
<I>file</I> is in your working directory, but does not
correspond to anything in the source repository, and is
not in the list of files for <B>cvs</B> to ignore (see the
description of the <B>-I</B> option, and
see node `cvsignoreaq in the CVS manual).
