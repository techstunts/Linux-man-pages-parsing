<H2>BASH BUILTIN COMMANDS</H2>















<P>

Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this
section as accepting options preceded by
<B>-</B>

accepts
<B>--</B>

to signify the end of the options.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>:</B> [<I>arguments</I>]<DD>

No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding
<I>arguments</I>

and performing any specified
redirections.  A zero exit code is returned.
<DT><B> . </B> <I>filename</I> [<I>arguments</I>]<DD>

<DT><B>source</B> <I>filename</I> [<I>arguments</I>]<DD>

Read and execute commands from
<I>filename</I>

in the current
shell environment and return the exit status of the last command
executed from
<I>filename</I>.

If
<I>filename</I>

does not contain a slash, file names in
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>

</FONT>
are used to find the directory containing
<I>filename</I>.

The file searched for in
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>

</FONT>
need not be executable.
When <B>bash</B> is not in <I>posix mode</I>, the current directory is
searched if no file is found in
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>.

</FONT>
If the
<B>sourcepath</B>

option to the
<B>shopt</B>

builtin command is turned off, the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>

</FONT>
is not searched.
If any <I>arguments</I> are supplied, they become the positional
parameters when <I>filename</I> is executed.  Otherwise the positional
parameters are unchanged.
The return status is the status of the last command exited within
the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if
<I>filename</I>

is not found or cannot be read.
<DT><B>alias</B> [<B>-p</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>] ...]<DD>
<B>Alias</B> with no arguments or with the
<B>-p</B>

option prints the list of aliases in the form
<B>alias</B> <I>name</I>=<I>value</I> on standard output.
When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for
each <I>name</I> whose <I>value</I> is given.
A trailing space in  <I>value</I> causes the next word to be
checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.
For each <I>name</I> in the argument list for which no <I>value</I>
is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.
<B>Alias</B> returns true unless a <I>name</I> is given for which
no alias has been defined.
<DT><B>bg</B> [<I>jobspec</I>]<DD>
Resume the suspended job <I>jobspec</I> in the background, as if it
had been started with
<B>&amp;</B>.

If <I>jobspec</I> is not present, the shell's notion of the
<I>current job</I> is used.
<B>bg</B>

<I>jobspec</I>

returns 0 unless run when job control is disabled or, when run with
job control enabled, if <I>jobspec</I> was not found or started without
job control.
<DT><B>bind</B> [<B>-m</B> <I>keymap</I>] [<B>-lpsvPSV</B>]<DD>

<DT><B>bind</B> [<B>-m</B> <I>keymap</I>] [<B>-q</B> <I>function</I>] [<B>-u</B> <I>function</I>] [<B>-r</B> <I>keyseq</I>]<DD>
<DT><B>bind</B> [<B>-m</B> <I>keymap</I>] <B>-f</B> <I>filename</I><DD>
<DT><B>bind</B> [<B>-m</B> <I>keymap</I>] <B>-x</B> <I>keyseq</I>:<I>shell-command</I><DD>
<DT><B>bind</B> [<B>-m</B> <I>keymap</I>] <I>keyseq</I>:<I>function-name</I><DD>
<DT><B>bind</B> <I>readline-command</I><DD>

Display current
<B>readline</B>

key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a
<B>readline</B>

function or macro, or set a
<B>readline</B>

variable.
Each non-option argument is a command as it would appear in
<I>.inputrc</I>,

but each binding or command must be passed as a separate argument;
e.g., '&quot;\C-x\C-r&quot;: re-read-init-file'.
Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-m </B><I>keymap</I>

<DD>
Use
<I>keymap</I>

as the keymap to be affected by the subsequent bindings.
Acceptable
<I>keymap</I>

names are
<I>emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,
vi-move, vi-command</I>, and
<I>vi-insert</I>.

<I>vi</I> is equivalent to <I>vi-command</I>; <I>emacs</I> is
equivalent to <I>emacs-standard</I>.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
List the names of all <B>readline</B> functions.
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Display <B>readline</B> function names and bindings in such a way
that they can be re-read.
<DT><B>-P</B>

<DD>
List current <B>readline</B> function names and bindings.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Display <B>readline</B> variable names and values in such a way that they
can be re-read.
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
List current <B>readline</B> variable names and values.
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Display <B>readline</B> key sequences bound to macros and the strings
they output in such a way that they can be re-read.
<DT><B>-S</B>

<DD>
Display <B>readline</B> key sequences bound to macros and the strings
they output.
<DT><B>-f </B><I>filename</I>

<DD>
Read key bindings from <I>filename</I>.
<DT><B>-q </B><I>function</I>

<DD>
Query about which keys invoke the named <I>function</I>.
<DT><B>-u </B><I>function</I>

<DD>
Unbind all keys bound to the named <I>function</I>.
<DT><B>-r </B><I>keyseq</I>

<DD>
Remove any current binding for <I>keyseq</I>.
<DT><B>-x </B><I>keyseq</I>:<I>shell-command</I>

<DD>
Cause <I>shell-command</I> to be executed whenever <I>keyseq</I> is
entered.

</DL>
<P>

The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an
error occurred.
</DL>

<DT><B>break</B> [<I>n</I>]<DD>
Exit from within a
<B>for</B>,

<B>while</B>,

<B>until</B>,

or
<B>select</B>

loop.  If <I>n</I> is specified, break <I>n</I> levels.
<I>n</I>

must be &gt; 1.  If
<I>n</I>

is greater than the number of enclosing loops, all enclosing loops
are exited.  The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing
a loop when
<B>break</B>

is executed.
<DT><B>builtin</B> <I>shell-builtin</I> [<I>arguments</I>]<DD>
Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it
<I>arguments</I>,

and return its exit status.
This is useful when defining a
function whose name is the same as a shell builtin,
retaining the functionality of the builtin within the function.
The <B>cd</B> builtin is commonly redefined this way.
The return status is false if
<I>shell-builtin</I>

is not a shell builtin command.
<DT><B>cd</B> [<B>-L|-P</B>] [<I>dir</I>]<DD>
Change the current directory to <I>dir</I>.  The variable
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>HOME</B>

</FONT>
is the
default
<I>dir</I>.

The variable
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CDPATH</B>

</FONT>
defines the search path for the directory containing
<I>dir</I>.

Alternative directory names in
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CDPATH</B>

</FONT>
are separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CDPATH</B>

</FONT>
is the same as the current directory, i.e., ``<B>.</B>''.  If
<I>dir</I>

begins with a slash (/),
then
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CDPATH</B>

</FONT>
is not used. The
<B>-P</B>

option says to use the physical directory structure instead of
following symbolic links (see also the
<B>-P</B>

option to the
<B>set</B>

builtin command); the
<B>-L</B>

option forces symbolic links to be followed.  An argument of
<B>-</B>

is equivalent to
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>$OLDPWD</B>.

</FONT>
If a non-empty directory name from <B>CDPATH</B> is used, or if
<B>-</B> is the first argument, and the directory change is
successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is
written to the standard output.
The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed;
false otherwise.
<DT><B>caller</B> [<I>expr</I>]<DD>
Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or
a script executed with the <B>.</B> or <B>source</B> builtins.
Without <I>expr</I>, <B>caller</B> displays the line number and source
filename of the current subroutine call.
If a non-negative integer is supplied as <I>expr</I>, <B>caller</B> 
displays the line number, subroutine name, and source file corresponding
to that position in the current execution call stack.  This extra
information may be used, for example, to print a stack trace.  The
current frame is frame 0.
The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a subroutine
call or <I>expr</I> does not correspond to a valid position in the
call stack.
<DT><B>command</B> [<B>-pVv</B>] <I>command</I> [<I>arg</I> ...]<DD>
Run
<I>command</I>

with
<I>args</I>

suppressing the normal shell function lookup. Only builtin
commands or commands found in the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>

</FONT>
are executed.  If the
<B>-p</B>

option is given, the search for
<I>command</I>

is performed using a default value for
<B>PATH</B>

that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.
If either the
<B>-V</B>

or
<B>-v</B>

option is supplied, a description of
<I>command</I>

is printed.  The
<B>-v</B>

option causes a single word indicating the command or file name
used to invoke
<I>command</I>

to be displayed; the
<B>-V</B>

option produces a more verbose description.
If the
<B>-V</B>

or
<B>-v</B>

option is supplied, the exit status is 0 if
<I>command</I>

was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied and
an error occurred or
<I>command</I>

cannot be found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status of the
<B>command</B>

builtin is the exit status of
<I>command</I>.

<DT><B>compgen</B> [<I>option</I>] [<I>word</I>]<DD>
Generate possible completion matches for <I>word</I> according to
the <I>option</I>s, which may be any option accepted by the
<B>complete</B>

builtin with the exception of <B>-p</B> and <B>-r</B>, and write
the matches to the standard output.
When using the <B>-F</B> or <B>-C</B> options, the various shell variables
set by the programmable completion facilities, while available, will not
have useful values.
<P>
The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable
completion code had generated them directly from a completion specification
with the same flags.
If <I>word</I> is specified, only those completions matching <I>word</I>
will be displayed.
<P>
The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no
matches were generated.
<DT><B>complete</B> [<B>-abcdefgjksuv</B>] [<B>-o</B> <I>comp-option</I>] [<B>-A</B> <I>action</I>] [<B>-G</B> <I>globpat</I>] [<B>-W</B> <I>wordlist</I>] [<B>-P</B> <I>prefix</I>] [<B>-S</B> <I>suffix</I>]<DD>
<BR>

[<B>-X</B> <I>filterpat</I>] [<B>-F</B> <I>function</I>] [<B>-C</B> <I>command</I>] <I>name</I> [<I>name ...</I>]

<DT><B>complete</B> <B>-pr</B> [<I>name</I> ...]<DD>

Specify how arguments to each <I>name</I> should be completed.
If the <B>-p</B> option is supplied, or if no options are supplied,
existing completion specifications are printed in a way that allows
them to be reused as input.
The <B>-r</B> option removes a completion specification for
each <I>name</I>, or, if no <I>name</I>s are supplied, all
completion specifications.
<P>
The process of applying these completion specifications when word completion
is attempted is described above under <B>Programmable Completion</B>.
<P>
Other options, if specified, have the following meanings.
The arguments to the <B>-G</B>, <B>-W</B>, and <B>-X</B> options
(and, if necessary, the <B>-P</B> and <B>-S</B> options)
should be quoted to protect them from expansion before the
<B>complete</B>

builtin is invoked.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-o</B> <I>comp-option</I><DD>
The <I>comp-option</I> controls several aspects of the compspec's behavior
beyond the simple generation of completions.
<I>comp-option</I> may be one of:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>bashdefault</B>

<DD>
Perform the rest of the default <B>bash</B> completions if the compspec
generates no matches.
<DT><B>default</B>

<DD>
Use readline's default filename completion if the compspec generates
no matches.
<DT><B>dirnames</B>

<DD>
Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates no matches.
<DT><B>filenames</B>

<DD>
Tell readline that the compspec generates filenames, so it can perform any
filename-specific processing (like adding a slash to directory names or
suppressing trailing spaces).  Intended to be used with shell functions.
<DT><B>nospace</B>

<DD>
Tell readline not to append a space (the default) to words completed at
the end of the line.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>-A</B> <I>action</I><DD>
The <I>action</I> may be one of the following to generate a list of possible
completions:

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>-G</B> <I>globpat</I><DD>
The filename expansion pattern <I>globpat</I> is expanded to generate
the possible completions.
<DT><B>-W</B> <I>wordlist</I><DD>
The <I>wordlist</I> is split using the characters in the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>IFS</B>

</FONT>
special variable as delimiters, and each resultant word is expanded.
The possible completions are the members of the resultant list which
match the word being completed.
<DT><B>-C</B> <I>command</I><DD>
<I>command</I> is executed in a subshell environment, and its output is
used as the possible completions.
<DT><B>-F</B> <I>function</I><DD>
The shell function <I>function</I> is executed in the current shell
environment.
When it finishes, the possible completions are retrieved from the value

</FONT>
array variable.
<DT><B>-X</B> <I>filterpat</I><DD>
<I>filterpat</I> is a pattern as used for filename expansion.
It is applied to the list of possible completions generated by the
preceding options and arguments, and each completion matching
<I>filterpat</I> is removed from the list.
A leading <B>!</B> in <I>filterpat</I> negates the pattern; in this
case, any completion not matching <I>filterpat</I> is removed.
<DT><B>-P</B> <I>prefix</I><DD>
<I>prefix</I> is added at the beginning of each possible completion
after all other options have been applied.
<DT><B>-S</B> <I>suffix</I><DD>
<I>suffix</I> is appended to each possible completion
after all other options have been applied.

</DL>
<P>

The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an option
other than <B>-p</B> or <B>-r</B> is supplied without a <I>name</I>
argument, an attempt is made to remove a completion specification for
a <I>name</I> for which no specification exists, or
an error occurs adding a completion specification.
</DL>

<DT><B>continue</B> [<I>n</I>]<DD>
Resume the next iteration of the enclosing
<B>for</B>,

<B>while</B>,

<B>until</B>,

or
<B>select</B>

loop.
If
<I>n</I>

is specified, resume at the <I>n</I>th enclosing loop.
<I>n</I>

must be &gt; 1.  If
<I>n</I>

is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop
(the ``top-level'' loop) is resumed.  The return value is 0 unless the
shell is not executing a loop when
<B>continue</B>

is executed.
<DT><B>declare</B> [<B>-afFirtx</B>] [<B>-p</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>] ...]<DD>

<DT><B>typeset</B> [<B>-afFirtx</B>] [<B>-p</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>] ...]<DD>

Declare variables and/or give them attributes.
If no <I>name</I>s are given then display the values of variables.
The
<B>-p</B>

option will display the attributes and values of each
<I>name</I>.

When
<B>-p</B>

is used, additional options are ignored.
The
<B>-F</B>

option inhibits the display of function definitions; only the
function name and attributes are printed.
If the <B>extdebug</B> shell option is enabled using <B>shopt</B>,
the source file name and line number where the function is defined
are displayed as well.  The
<B>-F</B>

option implies
<B>-f</B>.

The following options can
be used to restrict output to variables with the specified attribute or
to give variables attributes:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
Each <I>name</I> is an array variable (see
<B>Arrays</B>

above).
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Use function names only.
<DT><B>-i</B>

<DD>
The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION ) </B>

</FONT>
is performed when the variable is assigned a value.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Make <I>name</I>s readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned values
by subsequent assignment statements or unset.
<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Give each <I>name</I> the <I>trace</I> attribute.
Traced functions inherit the <B>DEBUG</B> trap from the calling shell.
The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Mark <I>name</I>s for export to subsequent commands via the environment.

</DL>
<P>

Using `+' instead of `-'
turns off the attribute instead, with the exception that <B>+a</B>
may not be used to destroy an array variable.  When used in a function,
makes each
<I>name</I> local, as with the 
<B>local</B>

command.
If a variable name is followed by =<I>value</I>, the value of
the variable is set to <I>value</I>.
The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered,
an attempt is made to define a function using
``-f foo=bar'',

an attempt is made to assign a value to a readonly variable,
an attempt is made to assign a value to an array variable without
using the compound assignment syntax (see
<B>Arrays</B>

above), one of the <I>names</I> is not a valid shell variable name,
an attempt is made to turn off readonly status for a readonly variable,
an attempt is made to turn off array status for an array variable,
or an attempt is made to display a non-existent function with <B>-f</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>dirs [-clpv</B>] [+<I>n</I>] [-<I>n</I>]

<DD>
Without options, displays the list of currently remembered directories.
The default display is on a single line with directory names separated
by spaces.
Directories are added to the list with the 
<B>pushd</B>

command; the
<B>popd</B>

command removes entries from the list.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+</B><I>n</I><DD>
Displays the <I>n</I>th entry counting from the left of the list
shown by
<B>dirs</B>

when invoked without options, starting with zero.
<DT><B>-</B><I>n</I><DD>
Displays the <I>n</I>th entry counting from the right of the list
shown by
<B>dirs</B>

when invoked without options, starting with zero.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
Produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a 
tilde to denote the home directory.

Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Print the directory stack with one entry per line,
prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.

</DL>
<P>

The return value is 0 unless an
invalid option is supplied or <I>n</I> indexes beyond the end
of the directory stack.
</DL>

<DT><B>disown</B> [<B>-ar</B>] [<B>-h</B>] [<I>jobspec</I> ...]<DD>
Without options, each
<I>jobspec</I>

is removed from the table of active jobs.
If the <B>-h</B> option is given, each
<I>jobspec</I>

is not removed from the table, but is marked so that
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIGHUP</B>

</FONT>
is not sent to the job if the shell receives a
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIGHUP</B>.

</FONT>
If no
<I>jobspec</I>

is present, and neither the
<B>-a</B>

nor the
<B>-r</B>

option is supplied, the <I>current job</I> is used.
If no
<I>jobspec</I>

is supplied, the
<B>-a</B>

option means to remove or mark all jobs; the
<B>-r</B>

option without a
<I>jobspec</I>

argument restricts operation to running jobs.
The return value is 0 unless a
<I>jobspec</I>

does not specify a valid job.
<DT><B>echo</B> [<B>-neE</B>] [<I>arg</I> ...]<DD>
Output the <I>arg</I>s, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.
The return status is always 0.
If <B>-n</B> is specified, the trailing newline is
suppressed.  If the <B>-e</B> option is given, interpretation of
the following backslash-escaped characters is enabled.  The
<B>-E</B>

option disables the interpretation of these escape characters,
even on systems where they are interpreted by default.
The <B>xpg_echo</B> shell option may be used to
dynamically determine whether or not <B>echo</B> expands these
escape characters by default.
<B>echo</B>

does not interpret
<B>--</B>

to mean the end of options.
<B>echo</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>enable</B> [<B>-adnps</B>] [<B>-f</B> <I>filename</I>] [<I>name</I> ...]<DD>
Enable and disable builtin shell commands.
Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same name
as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname,
even though the shell normally searches for builtins before disk commands.
If <B>-n</B> is used, each <I>name</I>
is disabled; otherwise,
<I>names</I> are enabled.  For example, to use the
<B>test</B>

binary found via the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>

</FONT>
instead of the shell builtin version, run

``enable -n test''.
The
<B>-f</B>

option means to load the new builtin command
<I>name</I>

from shared object
<I>filename</I>,

on systems that support dynamic loading.  The
<B>-d</B>

option will delete a builtin previously loaded with
<B>-f</B>.

If no <I>name</I> arguments are given, or if the
<B>-p</B>

option is supplied, a list of shell builtins is printed.
With no other option arguments, the list consists of all enabled
shell builtins.
If <B>-n</B> is supplied, only disabled builtins are printed.
If <B>-a</B> is supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an
indication of whether or not each is enabled.
If <B>-s</B> is supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX
<I>special</I> builtins.
The return value is 0 unless a
<I>name</I>

is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin
from a shared object.
<DT><B>eval</B> [<I>arg</I> ...]<DD>
The <I>arg</I>s are read and concatenated together into a single
command.  This command is then read and executed by the shell, and
its exit status is returned as the value of
<B>eval</B>.

If there are no
<I>args</I>,

or only null arguments,
<B>eval</B>

returns 0.
<DT><B>exec</B> [<B>-cl</B>] [<B>-a</B> <I>name</I>] [<I>command</I> [<I>arguments</I>]]<DD>
If
<I>command</I>

is specified, it replaces the shell.
No new process is created.  The
<I>arguments</I>

become the arguments to <I>command</I>.
If the
<B>-l</B>

option is supplied,
the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth arg passed to 
<I>command</I>.

This is what
<I><A HREF="../man1/login.1.php">login</A></I>(1)

does.  The
<B>-c</B>

option causes
<I>command</I>

to be executed with an empty environment.  If
<B>-a</B>

is supplied, the shell passes
<I>name</I>

as the zeroth argument to the executed command.  If
<I>command</I>

cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits,
unless the shell option
<B>execfail</B>

is enabled, in which case it returns failure.
An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed.
If
<I>command</I>

is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell,
and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the
return status is 1.
<DT><B>exit</B> [<I>n</I>]<DD>
Cause the shell to exit
with a status of <I>n</I>.  If
<I>n</I>

is omitted, the exit status
is that of the last command executed.
A trap on
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>EXIT</B>

</FONT>
is executed before the shell terminates.
<DT><B>export</B> [<B>-fn</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>word</I>]] ...<DD>

<DT><B>export -p</B>

<DD>

The supplied
<I>names</I>

are marked for automatic export to the environment of
subsequently executed commands.  If the 
<B>-f</B>

option is given,
the 
<I>names</I>

refer to functions.
If no
<I>names</I>

are given, or if the
<B>-p</B>

option is supplied, a list
of all names that are exported in this shell is printed.
The
<B>-n</B>

option causes the export property to be removed from each
<I>name</I>.
If a variable name is followed by =<I>word</I>, the value of
the variable is set to <I>word</I>.
<B>export</B>

returns an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is
encountered,
one of the <I>names</I> is not a valid shell variable name, or
<B>-f</B>

is supplied with a
<I>name</I>

that is not a function.
<DT><B>fc</B> [<B>-e</B> <I>ename</I>] [<B>-nlr</B>] [<I>first</I>] [<I>last</I>]<DD>

<DT><B>fc</B> <B>-s</B> [<I>pat</I>=<I>rep</I>] [<I>cmd</I>]<DD>

Fix Command.  In the first form, a range of commands from
<I>first</I>

to
<I>last</I>

is selected from the history list.
<I>First</I>

and
<I>last</I>

may be specified as a string (to locate the last command beginning
with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list,
where a negative number is used as an offset from the current
command number).  If 
<I>last</I>

is not specified it is set to
the current command for listing (so that
``fc -l -10''

prints the last 10 commands) and to
<I>first</I>

otherwise.
If
<I>first</I>

is not specified it is set to the previous
command for editing and -16 for listing.
<P>
The
<B>-n</B>

option suppresses
the command numbers when listing.  The
<B>-r</B>

option reverses the order of
the commands.  If the
<B>-l</B>

option is given,
the commands are listed on
standard output.  Otherwise, the editor given by
<I>ename</I>

is invoked
on a file containing those commands.  If
<I>ename</I>

is not given, the
value of the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>FCEDIT</B>

</FONT>
variable is used, and
the value of
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>EDITOR</B>

</FONT>
if
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>FCEDIT</B>

</FONT>
is not set.  If neither variable is set,

is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands are
echoed and executed.
<P>
In the second form, <I>command</I> is re-executed after each instance
of <I>pat</I> is replaced by <I>rep</I>.
A useful alias to use with this is
``r=&quot;fc -s&quot;'',

so that typing
``r cc''

runs the last command beginning with
``cc''

and typing
``r''

re-executes the last command.
<P>
If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid
option is encountered or
<I>first</I>

or
<I>last</I>

specify history lines out of range.
If the
<B>-e</B>

option is supplied, the return value is the value of the last
command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary
file of commands.  If the second form is used, the return status
is that of the command re-executed, unless
<I>cmd</I>

does not specify a valid history line, in which case
<B>fc</B>

returns failure.
<DT><B>fg</B> [<I>jobspec</I>]<DD>
Resume
<I>jobspec</I>

in the foreground, and make it the current job.
If
<I>jobspec</I>

is not present, the shell's notion of the <I>current job</I> is used.
The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground,
or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with
job control enabled, if
<I>jobspec</I>

does not specify a valid job or
<I>jobspec</I>

specifies a job that was started without job control.
<DT><B>getopts</B> <I>optstring</I> <I>name</I> [<I>args</I>]<DD>
<B>getopts</B>

is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.
<I>optstring</I>

contains the option characters to be recognized; if a character
is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an
argument, which should be separated from it by white space.
The colon and question mark characters may not be used as
option characters.
Each time it is invoked,
<B>getopts</B>

places the next option in the shell variable
<I>name</I>,

initializing
<I>name</I>

if it does not exist,
and the index of the next argument to be processed into the
variable
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTIND</B>.

</FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTIND</B>

</FONT>
is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script
is invoked.  When an option requires an argument,
<B>getopts</B>

places that argument into the variable
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTARG</B>.

</FONT>
The shell does not reset
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTIND</B>

</FONT>
automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple
calls to
<B>getopts</B>

within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters
is to be used.
<P>
When the end of options is encountered, <B>getopts</B> exits with a
return value greater than zero.
<B>OPTIND</B> is set to the index of the first non-option argument,
and <B>name</B> is set to ?.
<P>
<B>getopts</B>

normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are
given in
<I>args</I>,

<B>getopts</B>

parses those instead.
<P>
<B>getopts</B>

can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of
<I>optstring</I>

is a colon,
<I>silent</I>

error reporting is used.  In normal operation diagnostic messages
are printed when invalid options or missing option arguments are
encountered.
If the variable
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTERR</B>

</FONT>
is set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if the first
character of 
<I>optstring</I>

is not a colon.
<P>
If an invalid option is seen,
<B>getopts</B>

places ? into
<I>name</I>

and, if not silent,
prints an error message and unsets
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTARG</B>.

</FONT>
If
<B>getopts</B>

is silent,
the option character found is placed in
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTARG</B>

</FONT>
and no diagnostic message is printed.
<P>
If a required argument is not found, and
<B>getopts</B>

is not silent,
a question mark (<B>?</B>) is placed in
<I>name</I>,

<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTARG</B>

</FONT>
is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.
If
<B>getopts</B>

is silent, then a colon (<B>:</B>) is placed in
<I>name</I>

and
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPTARG</B>

</FONT>
is set to the option character found.
<P>
<B>getopts</B>

returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.
It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an
error occurs.
<DT><B>hash</B> [<B>-lr</B>] [<B>-p</B> <I>filename</I>] [<B>-dt</B>] [<I>name</I>]<DD>
For each
<I>name</I>,

the full file name of the command is determined by searching
the directories in
<B>$PATH</B>

and remembered.
If the
<B>-p</B>

option is supplied, no path search is performed, and
<I>filename</I>

is used as the full file name of the command.
The
<B>-r</B>

option causes the shell to forget all
remembered locations.
The
<B>-d</B>

option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of each <I>name</I>.
If the
<B>-t</B>

option is supplied, the full pathname to which each <I>name</I> corresponds
is printed.  If multiple <I>name</I> arguments are supplied with <B>-t</B>,
the <I>name</I> is printed before the hashed full pathname.
The
<B>-l</B>

option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
If no arguments are given, or if only <B>-l</B> is supplied,
information about remembered commands is printed.
The return status is true unless a
<I>name</I>

is not found or an invalid option is supplied.
<DT><B>help</B> [<B>-s</B>] [<I>pattern</I>]<DD>
Display helpful information about builtin commands.  If
<I>pattern</I>

is specified,
<B>help</B>

gives detailed help on all commands matching
<I>pattern</I>;

otherwise help for all the builtins and shell control structures
is printed.
The <B>-s</B> option restricts the information displayed to a short
usage synopsis.
The return status is 0 unless no command matches
<I>pattern</I>.

<DT><B>history [</B><I>n</I>]<DD>

<DT><B>history</B> <B>-c</B><DD>
<DT><B>history -d</B> <I>offset</I><DD>

<DT><B>history</B> <B>-s</B> <I>arg</I> [<I>arg ...</I>]<DD>

With no options, display the command
history list with line numbers.  Lines listed
with a 
<B>*</B>

have been modified.  An argument of
<I>n</I>

lists only the last
<I>n</I>

lines.
If the shell variable <B>HISTTIMEFORMAT</B> is set and not null,
it is used as a format string for <I><A HREF="../man3/strftime.3.php">strftime</A></I>(3) to display
the time stamp associated with each displayed history entry.
No intervening blank is printed between the formatted time stamp
and the history line.
If <I>filename</I> is supplied, it is used as the
name of the history file; if not, the value of
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>HISTFILE</B>

</FONT>
is used.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.
<DT><B>-d</B> <I>offset</I><DD>
Delete the history entry at position <I>offset</I>.
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
Append the ``new'' history lines (history lines entered since the
beginning of the current <B>bash</B> session) to the history file.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
Read the history lines not already read from the history
file into the current history list.  These are lines
appended to the history file since the beginning of the
current <B>bash</B> session.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Read the contents of the history file
and use them as the current history.
<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
Write the current history to the history file, overwriting the
history file's contents.
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Perform history substitution on the following <I>args</I> and display
the result on the standard output.
Does not store the results in the history list.
Each <I>arg</I> must be quoted to disable normal history expansion.
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Store the
<I>args</I>

in the history list as a single entry.  The last command in the
history list is removed before the
<I>args</I>

are added.

</DL>
<P>

If the <B>HISTTIMEFORMAT</B> is set, the time stamp information
associated with each history entry is written to the history file.
The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an
error occurs while reading or writing the history file, an invalid
<I>offset</I> is supplied as an argument to <B>-d</B>, or the
history expansion supplied as an argument to <B>-p</B> fails.
</DL>

<DT><B>jobs</B> [<B>-lnprs</B>] [ <I>jobspec</I> ... ]<DD>

<DT><B>jobs</B> <B>-x</B> <I>command</I> [ <I>args</I> ... ]<DD>

The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the following
meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
List process IDs
in addition to the normal information.
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
List only the process ID of the job's process group
leader.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
Display information only about jobs that have changed status since
the user was last notified of their status.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Restrict output to running jobs.
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Restrict output to stopped jobs.

</DL>
<P>

If
<I>jobspec</I>

is given, output is restricted to information about that job.
The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered
or an invalid
<I>jobspec</I>

is supplied.
<P>

If the
<B>-x</B>

option is supplied,
<B>jobs</B>

replaces any
<I>jobspec</I>

found in
<I>command</I>

or
<I>args</I>

with the corresponding process group ID, and executes
<I>command</I>

passing it
<I>args</I>,

returning its exit status.
</DL>

<DT><B>kill</B> [<B>-s</B> <I>sigspec</I> | <B>-n</B> <I>signum</I> | <B>-</B><I>sigspec</I>] [<I>pid</I> | <I>jobspec</I>] ...<DD>

<DT><B>kill</B> <B>-l</B> [<I>sigspec</I> | <I>exit_status</I>]<DD>

Send the signal named by
<I>sigspec</I>

or
<I>signum</I>

to the processes named by
<I>pid</I>

or
<I>jobspec</I>.

<I>sigspec</I>

is either a case-insensitive signal name such as
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIGKILL</B>

</FONT>
(with or without the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIG</B>

</FONT>
prefix) or a signal number;
<I>signum</I>

is a signal number.
If
<I>sigspec</I>

is not present, then
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIGTERM</B>

</FONT>
is assumed.
An argument of
<B>-l</B>

lists the signal names.
If any arguments are supplied when
<B>-l</B>

is given, the names of the signals corresponding to the arguments are
listed, and the return status is 0.
The <I>exit_status</I> argument to
<B>-l</B>

is a number specifying either a signal number or the exit status of
a process terminated by a signal.
<B>kill</B>

returns true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or false
if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.
<DT><B>let</B> <I>arg</I> [<I>arg</I> ...]<DD>
Each
<I>arg</I>

is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ARITHMETIC</B>EVALUATION<B>).</B>

</FONT>
If the last
<I>arg</I>

evaluates to 0,
<B>let</B>

returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.
<DT><B>local</B> [<I>option</I>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>value</I>] ...]<DD>
For each argument, a local variable named
<I>name </I>

is created, and assigned
<I>value</I>.

The <I>option</I> can be any of the options accepted by <B>declare</B>.
When
<B>local</B>

is used within a function, it causes the variable
<I>name</I>

to have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children.
With no operands,
<B>local</B>

writes a list of local variables to the standard output.  It is
an error to use
<B>local</B>

when not within a function.  The return status is 0 unless
<B>local</B>

is used outside a function, an invalid
<I>name</I>

is supplied, or
<I>name</I> is a readonly variable.
<DT><B>logout</B>

<DD>
Exit a login shell.
<DT><B>popd</B> [-<B>n</B>] [+<I>n</I>] [-<I>n</I>]<DD>
Removes entries from the directory stack.  With no arguments,
removes the top directory from the stack, and performs a
<B>cd</B>

to the new top directory.
Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+</B><I>n</I><DD>
Removes the <I>n</I>th entry counting from the left of the list
shown by
<B>dirs</B>,

starting with zero.  For example:
``popd +0''

removes the first directory,
``popd +1''

the second.
<DT><B>-</B><I>n</I><DD>
Removes the <I>n</I>th entry counting from the right of the list
shown by
<B>dirs</B>,

starting with zero.  For example:
``popd -0''

removes the last directory,
``popd -1''

the next to last.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing directories
from the stack, so that only the stack is manipulated.

</DL>
<P>

If the
<B>popd</B>

command is successful, a 
<B>dirs</B>

is performed as well, and the return status is 0.
<B>popd</B>

returns false if an invalid option is encountered, the directory stack
is empty, a non-existent directory stack entry is specified, or the
directory change fails.
</DL>

<DT><B>printf</B> <I>format</I> [<I>arguments</I>]<DD>
Write the formatted <I>arguments</I> to the standard output under the
control of the <I>format</I>.
The <I>format</I> is a character string which contains three types of objects:
plain characters, which are simply copied to standard output, character
escape sequences, which are converted and copied to the standard output, and
format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive
<I>argument</I>.
In addition to the standard <I><A HREF="../man1/printf.1.php">printf</A></I>(1) formats, <B>%b</B> causes
<B>printf</B> to expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding
<I>argument</I> (except that <B>\c</B> terminates output, backslashes in
<B>\'</B>, <B>\&quot;</B>, and <B>\?</B> are not removed, and octal escapes
beginning with <B>\0</B> may contain up to four digits),
and <B>%q</B> causes <B>printf</B> to output the corresponding
<I>argument</I> in a format that can be reused as shell input.
<P>
The <I>format</I> is reused as necessary to consume all of the <I>arguments</I>.
If the <I>format</I> requires more <I>arguments</I> than are supplied, the
extra format specifications behave as if a zero value or null string, as
appropriate, had been supplied.  The return value is zero on success,
non-zero on failure.
<DT><B>pushd</B> [<B>-n</B>] [<I>dir</I>]<DD>

<DT><B>pushd</B> [<B>-n</B>] [+<I>n</I>] [-<I>n</I>]<DD>

Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates
the stack, making the new top of the stack the current working
directory.  With no arguments, exchanges the top two directories
and returns 0, unless the directory stack is empty.
Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+</B><I>n</I><DD>
Rotates the stack so that the <I>n</I>th directory
(counting from the left of the list shown by
<B>dirs</B>,

starting with zero)
is at the top.
<DT><B>-</B><I>n</I><DD>
Rotates the stack so that the <I>n</I>th directory
(counting from the right of the list shown by
<B>dirs</B>,

starting with zero) is at the top.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
Suppresses the normal change of directory when adding directories
to the stack, so that only the stack is manipulated.
<DT><I>dir</I>

<DD>
Adds
<I>dir</I>

to the directory stack at the top, making it the
new current working directory.

</DL>
<P>

If the
<B>pushd</B>

command is successful, a 
<B>dirs</B>

is performed as well.
If the first form is used,
<B>pushd</B>

returns 0 unless the cd to
<I>dir</I>

fails.  With the second form,
<B>pushd</B>

returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty,
a non-existent directory stack element is specified,
or the directory change to the specified new current directory
fails.
</DL>

<DT><B>pwd</B> [<B>-LP</B>]<DD>
Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.
The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the
<B>-P</B>

option is supplied or the 
<B>-o physical</B>

option to the
<B>set</B>

builtin command is enabled.
If the
<B>-L</B>

option is used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic links.
The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while
reading the name of the current directory or an
invalid option is supplied.
<DT><B>read</B> [<B>-ers</B>] [<B>-u</B> <I>fd</I>] [<B>-t</B> <I>timeout</I>] [<B>-a</B> <I>aname</I>] [<B>-p</B> <I>prompt</I>] [<B>-n</B> <I>nchars</I>] [<B>-d</B> <I>delim</I>] [<I>name</I> ...]<DD>
One line is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor
<I>fd</I> supplied as an argument to the <B>-u</B> option, and the first word
is assigned to the first
<I>name</I>,

the second word to the second
<I>name</I>,

and so on, with leftover words and their intervening separators assigned
to the last
<I>name</I>.

If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names,
the remaining names are assigned empty values.
The characters in 
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>IFS</B>

</FONT>
are used to split the line into words.
The backslash character (<B>\</B>) may be used to remove any special
meaning for the next character read and for line continuation.
Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a </B><I>aname</I>

<DD>
The words are assigned to sequential indices
of the array variable
<I>aname</I>,

starting at 0.
<I>aname</I>

is unset before any new values are assigned.
Other <I>name</I> arguments are ignored.
<DT><B>-d </B><I>delim</I>

<DD>
The first character of <I>delim</I> is used to terminate the input line,
rather than newline.
<DT><B>-e</B>

<DD>
If the standard input
is coming from a terminal,
<B>readline</B>

(see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>READLINE</B>

</FONT>
above) is used to obtain the line.
<DT><B>-n </B><I>nchars</I>

<DD>
<B>read</B> returns after reading <I>nchars</I> characters rather than
waiting for a complete line of input.
<DT><B>-p </B><I>prompt</I>

<DD>
Display <I>prompt</I> on standard error, without a
trailing newline, before attempting to read any input.  The prompt
is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Backslash does not act as an escape character.
The backslash is considered to be part of the line.
In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not be used as a line
continuation.
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are
not echoed.
<DT><B>-t </B><I>timeout</I>

<DD>
Cause <B>read</B> to time out and return failure if a complete line of
input is not read within <I>timeout</I> seconds.
This option has no effect if <B>read</B> is not reading input from the
terminal or a pipe.
<DT><B>-u </B><I>fdFP</I>

<DD>
Read input from file descriptor <I>fd</I>.

</DL>
<P>

If no
<I>names</I>

are supplied, the line read is assigned to the variable
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>REPLY</B>.

</FONT>
The return code is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, <B>read</B>
times out, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to
<B>-u</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>readonly</B> [<B>-apf</B>] [<I>name</I>[=<I>word</I>] ...]<DD>

The given
<I>names</I> are marked readonly; the values of these
<I>names</I>

may not be changed by subsequent assignment.
If the
<B>-f</B>

option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the
<I>names</I> are so
marked.
The
<B>-a</B>

option restricts the variables to arrays.
If no
<I>name</I>

arguments are given, or if the
<B>-p</B>

option is supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed.
The
<B>-p</B>

option causes output to be displayed in a format that
may be reused as input.
If a variable name is followed by =<I>word</I>, the value of
the variable is set to <I>word</I>.
The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered,
one of the
<I>names</I>

is not a valid shell variable name, or
<B>-f</B>

is supplied with a
<I>name</I>

that is not a function.
<DT><B>return</B> [<I>n</I>]<DD>
Causes a function to exit with the return value specified by
<I>n</I>.

If 
<I>n</I>

is omitted, the return status is that of the last command
executed in the function body.  If used outside a function,
but during execution of a script by the 
<B>.</B>

(<B>source</B>) command, it causes the shell to stop executing
that script and return either
<I>n</I>

or the exit status of the last command executed within the
script as the exit status of the script.  If used outside a
function and not during execution of a script by <B>.</B>,
the return status is false.
Any command associated with the <B>RETURN</B> trap is executed
before execution resumes after the function or script.
<DT><B>set</B> [<B>--abefhkmnptuvxBCHP</B>] [<B>-o</B> <I>option</I>] [<I>arg</I> ...]<DD>
Without options, the name and value of each shell variable are displayed
in a format that can be reused as input.
The output is sorted according to the current locale.
When options are specified, they set or unset shell attributes.
Any arguments remaining after the options are processed are treated
as values for the positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to 
<B>$1</B>,

<B>$2</B>,

<B>...</B>

<B>$</B><I>n</I>.

Options, if specified, have the following meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
Automatically mark variables and functions which are modified or
created for export to the environment of subsequent commands.
<DT><B>-b</B>

<DD>
Report the status of terminated background jobs
immediately, rather than before the next primary prompt.  This is
effective only when job control is enabled.
<DT><B>-e</B>

<DD>
Exit immediately if a <I>simple command</I> (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SHELL GRAMMAR</B>

</FONT>
above) exits with a non-zero status.
The shell does not exit if the
command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a
<B>while</B>

or
<B>until</B>

keyword, 
part of the test in an
<I>if</I>

statement, part of a
<B>&amp;&amp;</B>

or
<B>||</B>

list, or if the command's return value is
being inverted via
<B>!</B>.

A trap on <B>ERR</B>, if set, is executed before the shell exits.
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Disable pathname expansion.
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Remember the location of commands as they are looked up for execution.
This is enabled by default.
<DT><B>-k</B>

<DD>
All arguments in the form of assignment statements
are placed in the environment for a command, not just
those that precede the command name.
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This option is on
by default for interactive shells on systems that support
it (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>JOB CONTROL</B>

</FONT>
above).  Background processes run in a separate process
group and a line containing their exit status is printed
upon their completion.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
Read commands but do not execute them.  This may be used to 
check a shell script for syntax errors.  This is ignored by
interactive shells.
<DT><B>-o </B><I>option-name</I>

<DD>
The <I>option-name</I> can be one of the following:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT><B>pipefail</B>

<DD>
If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last
(rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all
commands in the pipeline exit successfully.
This option is disabled by default.
<DT><B>posix</B>

<DD>
Change the behavior of
<B>bash</B>

where the default operation differs
from the POSIX 1003.2 standard to match the standard (<I>`posix mode</I>).

<P>
</DL>
<P>

If
<B>-o</B>

is supplied with no <I>option-name</I>, the values of the current options are
printed.
If
<B>+o</B>

is supplied with no <I>option-name</I>, a series of
<B>set</B>

commands to recreate the current option settings is displayed on
the standard output.
</DL>

<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Turn on
<I>privileged</I>

mode.  In this mode, the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>$ENV</B>

</FONT>
and
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>$BASH_ENV</B>

</FONT>
files are not processed, shell functions are not inherited from the
environment, and the
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SHELLOPTS</B>

</FONT>
variable, if it appears in the environment, is ignored.
If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the
real user (group) id, and the <B>-p</B> option is not supplied, these actions
are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user id.
If the <B>-p</B> option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is
not reset.
Turning this option off causes the effective user
and group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.
<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Exit after reading and executing one command.
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>
Treat unset variables as an error when performing
parameter expansion.  If expansion is attempted on an
unset variable, the shell prints an error message, and,
if not interactive, exits with a non-zero status.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Print shell input lines as they are read.
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
After expanding each <I>simple command</I>,
<B>for</B> command, <B>case</B> command, <B>select</B> command, or
arithmetic <B>for</B> command, display the expanded value of
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PS4</B>,

</FONT>
followed by the command and its expanded arguments
or associated word list.
<DT><B>-B</B>

<DD>
The shell performs brace expansion (see
<B>Brace Expansion</B>

above).  This is on by default.
<DT><B>-C</B>

<DD>
If set,
<B>bash</B>

does not overwrite an existing file with the
<B>&gt;</B>,

<B>&gt;&amp;</B>,

and
<B>&lt;&gt;</B>

redirection operators.  This may be overridden when 
creating output files by using the redirection operator
<B>&gt;|</B>

instead of
<B>&gt;</B>.

<DT><B>-E</B>

<DD>
If set, any trap on <B>ERR</B> is inherited by shell functions, command
substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.
The <B>ERR</B> trap is normally not inherited in such cases.
<DT><B>-H</B>

<DD>
Enable
<B>!</B>

style history substitution.  This option is on by
default when the shell is interactive.
<DT><B>-P</B>

<DD>
If set, the shell does not follow symbolic links when executing
commands such as
<B>cd</B>

that change the current working directory.  It uses the
physical directory structure instead.  By default,
<B>bash</B>

follows the logical chain of directories when performing commands
which change the current directory.
<DT><B>-T</B>

<DD>
If set, any trap on <B>DEBUG</B> is inherited by shell functions, command
substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.
The <B>DEBUG</B> trap is normally not inherited in such cases.
<DT><B>--</B>

<DD>
If no arguments follow this option, then the positional parameters are
unset.  Otherwise, the positional parameters are set to the
<I>arg</I>s, even if some of them begin with a
<B>-</B>.

<DT><B>-</B>

<DD>
Signal the end of options, cause all remaining <I>arg</I>s to be
assigned to the positional parameters.  The
<B>-x</B>

and
<B>-v</B>

options are turned off.
If there are no <I>arg</I>s,
the positional parameters remain unchanged.

</DL>
<P>

The options are off by default unless otherwise noted.
Using + rather than - causes these options to be turned off.
The options can also be specified as arguments to an invocation of
the shell.
The current set of options may be found in
<B>$-</B>.

The return status is always true unless an invalid option is encountered.
</DL>

<DT><B>shift</B> [<I>n</I>]<DD>
The positional parameters from <I>n</I>+1 ... are renamed to
<B>$1</B>

<B>....</B>

Parameters represented by the numbers <B>$#</B>
down to <B>$#</B>-<I>n</I>+1 are unset.
<I>n</I>

must be a non-negative number less than or equal to <B>$#</B>.
If
<I>n</I>

is 0, no parameters are changed.
If
<I>n </I>

is not given, it is assumed to be 1.
If
<I>n</I>

is greater than <B>$#</B>, the positional parameters are not changed.
The return status is greater than zero if
<I>n</I>

is greater than
<B>$#</B>

or less than zero; otherwise 0.
<DT><B>shopt</B> [<B>-pqsu</B>] [<B>-o</B>] [<I>optname</I> ...]<DD>
Toggle the values of variables controlling optional shell behavior.
With no options, or with the
<B>-p</B>

option, a list of all settable options is displayed, with
an indication of whether or not each is set.
The <B>-p</B> option causes output to be displayed in a form that
may be reused as input.
Other options have the following meanings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Enable (set) each <I>optname</I>.
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>
Disable (unset) each <I>optname</I>.
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>
Suppresses normal output (quiet mode); the return status indicates
whether the <I>optname</I> is set or unset.
If multiple <I>optname</I> arguments are given with
<B>-q</B>,

the return status is zero if all <I>optnames</I> are enabled; non-zero
otherwise.
<DT><B>-o</B>

<DD>
Restricts the values of <I>optname</I> to be those defined for the
<B>-o</B>

option to the
<B>set</B>

builtin.

</DL>
<P>

If either
<B>-s</B>

or
<B>-u</B>

is used with no <I>optname</I> arguments, the display is limited to
those options which are set or unset, respectively.
Unless otherwise noted, the <B>shopt</B> options are disabled (unset)
by default.
<P>

The return status when listing options is zero if all <I>optnames</I>
are enabled, non-zero otherwise.  When setting or unsetting options,
the return status is zero unless an <I>optname</I> is not a valid shell
option.
<P>

The list of <B>shopt</B> options is:

<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>cdable_vars</B>

<DD>
If set, an argument to the
<B>cd</B>

builtin command that
is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose
value is the directory to change to.
<DT><B>cdspell</B>

<DD>
If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a
<B>cd</B>

command will be corrected.
The errors checked for are transposed characters,
a missing character, and one character too many.
If a correction is found, the corrected file name is printed,
and the command proceeds.
This option is only used by interactive shells.
<DT><B>checkhash</B>

<DD>
If set, <B>bash</B> checks that a command found in the hash
table exists before trying to execute it.  If a hashed command no
longer exists, a normal path search is performed.
<DT><B>checkwinsize</B>

<DD>
If set, <B>bash</B> checks the window size after each command
and, if necessary, updates the values of
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>LINES</B>

</FONT>
and
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>COLUMNS</B>.

</FONT>
<DT><B>cmdhist</B>

<DD>
If set,
<B>bash</B>

attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line
command in the same history entry.  This allows
easy re-editing of multi-line commands.
<DT><B>dotglob</B>

<DD>
If set, 
<B>bash</B>

includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname
expansion.
<DT><B>execfail</B>

<DD>
If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if
it cannot execute the file specified as an argument to the
<B>exec</B>

builtin command.  An interactive shell does not exit if
<B>exec</B>

fails.
<DT><B>expand_aliases</B>

<DD>
If set, aliases are expanded as described above under
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ALIASES</B>.

</FONT>
This option is enabled by default for interactive shells.
<DT><B>extdebug</B>

<DD>
If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1.</B>

<DD>
The <B>-F</B> option to the <B>declare</B> builtin displays the source
file name and line number corresponding to each function name supplied
as an argument.
<DT><B>2.</B>

<DD>
If the command run by the <B>DEBUG</B> trap returns a non-zero value, the
next command is skipped and not executed.
<DT><B>3.</B>

<DD>
If the command run by the <B>DEBUG</B> trap returns a value of 2, and the
shell is executing in a subroutine (a shell function or a shell script
executed by the <B>.</B> or <B>source</B> builtins), a call to
<B>return</B> is simulated.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>extglob</B>

<DD>
If set, the extended pattern matching features described above under
<B>Pathname Expansion</B> are enabled.
<DT><B>extquote</B>

<DD>
If set, <B>$</B>'<I>string</I>' and <B>$</B>&quot;<I>string</I>&quot; quoting is
performed within <B>${</B><I>parameter</I><B>}</B> expansions
enclosed in double quotes.  This option is enabled by default.
<DT><B>failglob</B>

<DD>
If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion
result in an expansion error.
<DT><B>force_fignore</B>

<DD>
If set, the suffixes specified by the <B>FIGNORE</B> shell variable
cause words to be ignored when performing word completion even if
the ignored words are the only possible completions.
See
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SHELL VARIABLES</B></FONT>
above for a description of <B>FIGNORE</B>.
This option is enabled by default.
<DT><B>gnu_errfmt</B>

<DD>
If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error
message format.
<DT><B>histappend</B>

<DD>
If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value
of the
<B>HISTFILE</B>

variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.
<DT><B>histreedit</B>

<DD>
If set, and
<B>readline</B>

is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a
failed history substitution.
<DT><B>histverify</B>

<DD>
If set, and 
<B>readline</B>

is being used, the results of history substitution are not immediately
passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into
the <B>readline</B> editing buffer, allowing further modification.
<DT><B>hostcomplete</B>

<DD>
If set, and
<B>readline</B>

is being used, <B>bash</B> will attempt to perform hostname completion when a
word containing a <B>@</B> is being completed (see
<B>Completing</B>

under
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>READLINE</B>

</FONT>
above).
This is enabled by default.
<DT><B>huponexit</B>

<DD>
If set, <B>bash</B> will send
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIGHUP</B>

</FONT>
to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.
<DT><B>interactive_comments</B>

<DD>
If set, allow a word beginning with
<B>#</B>

to cause that word and all remaining characters on that
line to be ignored in an interactive shell (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>COMMENTS</B>

</FONT>
above).  This option is enabled by default.
<DT><B>lithist</B>

<DD>
If set, and the
<B>cmdhist</B>

option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history with
embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.
<DT><B>login_shell</B>

<DD>
The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>INVOCATION</B>

</FONT>
above).
The value may not be changed.
<DT><B>mailwarn</B>

<DD>
If set, and a file that <B>bash</B> is checking for mail has been  
accessed since the last time it was checked, the message ``The mail in
<I>mailfile</I> has been read'' is displayed.
<DT><B>no_empty_cmd_completion</B>

<DD>
If set, and
<B>readline</B>

is being used,
<B>bash</B>

will not attempt to search the <B>PATH</B> for possible completions when
completion is attempted on an empty line.
<DT><B>nocaseglob</B>

<DD>
If set,
<B>bash</B>

matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname
expansion (see
<B>Pathname Expansion</B>

above).
<DT><B>nullglob</B>

<DD>
If set,
<B>bash</B>

allows patterns which match no
files (see
<B>Pathname Expansion</B>

above)
to expand to a null string, rather than themselves.
<DT><B>progcomp</B>

<DD>
If set, the programmable completion facilities (see
<B>Programmable Completion</B> above) are enabled.
This option is enabled by default.
<DT><B>promptvars</B>

<DD>
If set, prompt strings undergo
parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described in
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PROMPTING</B>

</FONT>
above.  This option is enabled by default.
<DT><B>restricted_shell</B>

<DD>
The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RESTRICTED SHELL</B>

</FONT>
below).
The value may not be changed.
This is not reset when the startup files are executed, allowing
the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted.
<DT><B>shift_verbose</B>

<DD>
If set, the
<B>shift</B>

builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the
number of positional parameters.
<DT><B>sourcepath</B>

<DD>
If set, the
<B>source</B> (<B>.</B>) builtin uses the value of
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>

</FONT>
to find the directory containing the file supplied as an argument.
This option is enabled by default.
<DT><B>xpg_echo</B>

<DD>
If set, the <B>echo</B> builtin expands backslash-escape sequences
by default.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>suspend</B> [<B>-f</B>]<DD>
Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SIGCONT</B>

</FONT>
signal.  The
<B>-f</B>

option says not to complain if this is 
a login shell; just suspend anyway.  The return status is 0 unless
the shell is a login shell and
<B>-f</B>

is not supplied, or if job control is not enabled.
<DT><B>test</B> <I>expr</I><DD>

<DT><B>[</B> <I>expr</I> <B>]</B><DD>
Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on
the evaluation of the conditional expression
<I>expr</I>.

Each operator and operand must be a separate argument.
Expressions are composed of the primaries described above under
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CONDITIONAL</B>EXPRESSIONS<B>.</B>

</FONT>

<P>

Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed
in decreasing order of precedence.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>! </B><I>expr</I>

<DD>
True if
<I>expr</I>

is false.
<DT><B>( </B><I>expr</I> )

<DD>
Returns the value of <I>expr</I>.
This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.
<DT><I>expr1</I> -<B>a</B> <I>expr2</I><DD>
True if both
<I>expr1</I>

and
<I>expr2</I>

are true.
<DT><I>expr1</I> -<B>o</B> <I>expr2</I><DD>
True if either
<I>expr1</I>

or
<I>expr2</I>

is true.

</DL>
<P>

<B>test</B> and <B>[</B> evaluate conditional
expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments.

<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0 arguments<DD>
The expression is false.
<DT>1 argument<DD>
The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.
<DT>2 arguments<DD>
If the first argument is <B>!</B>, the expression is true if and
only if the second argument is null.
If the first argument is one of the unary conditional operators listed above
under
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CONDITIONAL</B>EXPRESSIONS<B>,</B>

</FONT>
the expression is true if the unary test is true.
If the first argument is not a valid unary conditional operator, the expression
is false.
<DT>3 arguments<DD>
If the second argument is one of the binary conditional operators listed above
under
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CONDITIONAL</B>EXPRESSIONS<B>,</B>

</FONT>
the result of the expression is the result of the binary test using
the first and third arguments as operands.
If the first argument is <B>!</B>, the value is the negation of
the two-argument test using the second and third arguments.
If the first argument is exactly <B>(</B> and the third argument is
exactly <B>)</B>, the result is the one-argument test of the second
argument.
Otherwise, the expression is false.
The <B>-a</B> and <B>-o</B> operators are considered binary operators
in this case.  
<DT>4 arguments<DD>
If the first argument is <B>!</B>, the result is the negation of
the three-argument expression composed of the remaining arguments.
Otherwise, the expression is parsed and evaluated according to 
precedence using the rules listed above.
<DT>5 or more arguments<DD>
The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence
using the rules listed above.
</DL>
</DL>


<DT><B>times</B>

<DD>
Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and
for processes run from the shell.  The return status is 0.
<DT><B>trap</B> [<B>-lp</B>] [[<I>arg</I>] <I>sigspec</I> ...]<DD>
The command
<I>arg</I>

is to be read and executed when the shell receives
signal(s)
<I>sigspec</I>.

If
<I>arg</I>

is absent (and there is a single <I>sigspec</I>) or
<B>-</B>,

each specified signal is
reset to its original disposition (the value it had
upon entrance to the shell).
If 
<I>arg</I>

is the null string the signal specified by each
<I>sigspec</I>

is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.
If
<I>arg</I>

is not present and
<B>-p</B>

has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each
<I>sigspec</I>

are displayed.
If no arguments are supplied or if only
<B>-p</B>

is given,
<B>trap</B>

prints the list of commands associated with each signal.
The
<B>-l</B>

option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and
their corresponding numbers.
Each
<I>sigspec</I>

is either
a signal name defined in &lt;<I>signal.h</I>&gt;, or a signal number.
Signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional.
If a
<I>sigspec</I>

is
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>EXIT</B>

</FONT>
(0) the command
<I>arg</I>

is executed on exit from the shell.
If a
<I>sigspec</I>

is
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DEBUG</B>,

</FONT>
the command
<I>arg</I>

is executed before every <I>simple command</I>, <I>for</I> command,
<I>case</I> command, <I>select</I> command, every arithmetic <I>for</I>
command, and before the first command executes in a shell function (see
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>SHELL GRAMMAR</B>

</FONT>
above).
Refer to the description of the <B>extglob</B> option to the
<B>shopt</B> builtin for details of its effect on the <B>DEBUG</B> trap.
If a
<I>sigspec</I>

is
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ERR</B>,

</FONT>
the command
<I>arg</I>

is executed whenever a simple command has a non-zero exit status,
subject to the following conditions.
The
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ERR</B>

</FONT>
trap is not executed if the failed
command is part of the command list immediately following a
<B>while</B>

or
<B>until</B>

keyword, 
part of the test in an
<I>if</I>

statement, part of a
<B>&amp;&amp;</B>

or
<B>||</B>

list, or if the command's return value is
being inverted via
<B>!</B>.

These are the same conditions obeyed by the <B>errexit</B> option.
If a
<I>sigspec</I>

is
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RETURN</B>,

</FONT>
the command
<I>arg</I>

is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the
<B>.</B> or <B>source</B> builtins finishes executing.
Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.
Trapped signals are reset to their original values in a child
process when it is created.
The return status is false if any
<I>sigspec</I>

is invalid; otherwise
<B>trap</B>

returns true.
<DT><B>type</B> [<B>-aftpP</B>] <I>name</I> [<I>name</I> ...]<DD>
With no options, 
indicate how each
<I>name</I>

would be interpreted if used as a command name.
If the
<B>-t</B>

option is used,
<B>type</B>

prints a string which is one of
<I>alias</I>,

<I>keyword</I>,

<I>function</I>,

<I>builtin</I>,

or
<I>file </I>

if
<I>name</I>

is an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file,
respectively.
If the
<I>name</I>

is not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit status of false
is returned.
If the
<B>-p</B>

option is used,
<B>type</B>

either returns the name of the disk file
that would be executed if
<I>name</I>

were specified as a command name,
or nothing if

``type -t name''
would not return
<I>file</I>.

The
<B>-P</B>

option forces a
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>

</FONT>
search for each <I>name</I>, even if

``type -t name''
would not return
<I>file</I>.

If a command is hashed,
<B>-p</B>

and
<B>-P</B>

print the hashed value, not necessarily the file that appears
first in 
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>PATH</B>.

</FONT>
If the
<B>-a</B>

option is used, 
<B>type</B>

prints all of the places that contain
an executable named 
<I>name</I>.

This includes aliases and functions,
if and only if the 
<B>-p</B>

option is not also used.
The table of hashed commands is not consulted
when using
<B>-a</B>.

The
<B>-f</B>

option suppresses shell function lookup, as with the <B>command</B> builtin.
<B>type</B>

returns true if any of the arguments are found, false if
none are found.
<DT><B>ulimit</B> [<B>-SHacdflmnpstuv</B> [<I>limit</I>]]<DD>
Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to
processes started by it, on systems that allow such control.
The <B>-H</B> and <B>-S</B> options specify that the hard or soft limit is
set for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased once it
is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit.
If neither <B>-H</B> nor <B>-S</B> is specified, both the soft and hard
limits are set.
The value of
<I>limit</I>

can be a number in the unit specified for the resource
or one of the special values
<B>hard</B>,

<B>soft</B>,

or
<B>unlimited</B>,

which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit, and
no limit, respectively.
If
<I>limit</I>

is omitted, the current value of the soft limit of the resource is
printed, unless the <B>-H</B> option is given.  When more than one
resource is specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the value.
Other options are interpreted as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
All current limits are reported
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
The maximum size of core files created
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
The maximum size of a process's data segment
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
The maximum size of files created by the shell
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
The maximum size that may be locked into memory
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
The maximum resident set size
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not
allow this value to be set)
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
The maximum stack size
<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>
The maximum number of processes available to a single user
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell

</DL>
<P>

If
<I>limit</I>

is given, it is the new value of the specified resource (the
<B>-a</B>

option is display only).
If no option is given, then
<B>-f</B>

is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for
<B>-t</B>,

which is in seconds,
<B>-p</B>,

which is in units of 512-byte blocks,
and
<B>-n</B>

and
<B>-u</B>,

which are unscaled values.
The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument is supplied,
or an error occurs while setting a new limit.
</DL>

<DT><B>umask</B> [<B>-p</B>] [<B>-S</B>] [<I>mode</I>]<DD>
The user file-creation mask is set to 
<I>mode</I>.

If
<I>mode</I>

begins with a digit, it
is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise
it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar
to that accepted by
<I><A HREF="../man1/chmod.1.php">chmod</A></I>(1).

If
<I>mode</I>

is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.
The
<B>-S</B>

option causes the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the
default output is an octal number.
If the
<B>-p</B>

option is supplied, and
<I>mode</I>

is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as input.
The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if
no <I>mode</I> argument was supplied, and false otherwise.
<DT><B>unalias</B> [-<B>a</B>] [<I>name</I> ...]<DD>
Remove each <I>name</I> from the list of defined aliases.  If
<B>-a</B>

is supplied, all alias definitions are removed.  The return
value is true unless a supplied
<I>name</I>

is not a defined alias.
<DT><B>unset</B> [-<B>fv</B>] [<I>name</I> ...]<DD>
For each
<I>name</I>,

remove the corresponding variable or function.
If no options are supplied, or the
<B>-v</B>

option is given, each
<I>name</I>

refers to a shell variable.
Read-only variables may not be unset.
If
<B>-f</B>

is specifed, 
each
<I>name</I>

refers to a shell function, and the function definition
is removed.
Each unset variable or function is removed from the environment
passed to subsequent commands.
If any of
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>RANDOM</B>,

or
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>DIRSTACK</B>

</FONT>
are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are
subsequently reset.  The exit status is true unless a
<I>name</I>

is readonly.
<DT><B>wait</B> [<I>n</I>]<DD>
Wait for the specified process and return its termination
status.
<I>n</I>

may be a process
ID or a job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes
in that job's pipeline are waited for.  If
<I>n</I>

is not given, all currently active child processes
are waited for, and the return status is zero.  If
<I>n</I>

specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is
127.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last
process or job waited for.
