<H2>NAME</H2>

lame - create mp3 audio files
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

lame [options] &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

LAME is a program which can be used to create compressed audio files.
(Lame ain't an MP3 encoder).
These audio files can be played back by popular MP3 players such as
mpg123 or madplay.
To read from stdin, use &quot;-&quot; for &lt;infile&gt;.
To write to stdout, use a &quot;-&quot; for &lt;outfile&gt;.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

Input options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Assume the input file is raw pcm.
Sampling rate and mono/stereo/jstereo must be specified on the command line.
Without
<B>-r,</B>

LAME will perform several
<I>fseek()'s</I>

on the input file looking for WAV and AIFF headers.
<BR>

Might not be available on your release. 
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Swap bytes in the input file or output file when using
<B>--decode.</B>

<BR>

For sorting out little endian/big endian type problems.
If your encodings sounds like static,
try this first.
<DT><B>-s</B><I> sfreq</I>

<DD>
<I>sfreq</I>

= 8/11.025/12/16/22.05/24/32/44.1/48
<P>
Required only for raw PCM input files.
Otherwise it will be determined from the header of the input file.
<P>
LAME will automatically resample the input file to one of the supported
MP3 samplerates if necessary.
<DT><B>--bitwidth</B><I> n</I>

<DD>
Input bit width.
<BR>

<I>n</I>

= 8, 16, 24, 32 (default 16)
<P>
Required only for raw PCM input files.
Otherwise it will be determined from the header of the input file.
<DT><B>--mp2input</B>

<DD>
Assume the input file is a MPEG Layer II (ie MP2) file.
<BR>

If the filename ends in &quot;.mp2&quot; LAME will assume it is a MPEG Layer II file.
For stdin or Layer II files which do not end in .mp2 you need to use
this switch. 
<DT><B>--mp3input</B>

<DD>
Assume the input file is a MP3 file.
<BR>

Usefull for downsampling from one mp3 to another.
As an example,
it can be usefull for streaming through an IceCast server.
<BR>

If the filename ends in &quot;.mp3&quot; LAME will assume it is an MP3.
For stdin or MP3 files which do not end in .mp3 you need to use this switch. 
<DT><B>--nogap</B><I> file1 file2 ...</I>

<DD>
gapless encoding for a set of contiguous files
<DT><B>--nogapout</B><I> dir</I>

<DD>
output dir for gapless encoding (must precede --nogap)
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Operational options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-m</B><I> mode</I>

<DD>
<I>mode</I>

= s, j, f, d, m
<P>
Joint-stereo is the default mode for stereo files with VBR when
<B>-V</B>

is more than 4 or fixed bitrates of 160kbs or less.
At higher fixed bitrates or higher VBR settings,
the default is stereo. 
<P>
<B>(s)tereo </B>

<BR>

In this mode,
the encoder makes no use of potentially existing correlations between
the two input channels.
It can,
however,
negotiate the bit demand between both channel,
i.e. give one channel more bits if the other contains silence or needs
less bits because of a lower complexity.
<P>
<B>(j)oint stereo</B>

<BR>

In this mode,
the encoder will make use of a correlation between both channels.
The signal will be matrixed into a sum (&quot;mid&quot;),
computed by L+R,
and difference (&quot;side&quot;) signal,
computed by L-R,
and more bits are allocated to the mid channel.
This will effectively increase the bandwidth if the signal does not
have too much stereo separation,
thus giving a significant gain in encoding quality.
<P>
Using mid/side stereo inappropriately can result in audible
compression artifacts.
To much switching between mid/side and regular stereo can also
sound bad.
To determine when to switch to mid/side stereo,
LAME uses a much more sophisticated algorithm than that described
in the ISO documentation, and thus is safe to use in joint
stereo mode.
<P>
<B>(f)orced joint stereo </B>

<BR>

This mode will force MS joint stereo on all frames.
It is slightly faster than joint stereo,
but it should be used only if you are sure that every frame of the
input file has very little stereo separation.
<P>
<B>(d)ual channels</B>

<BR>

In this mode,
the 2 channels will be totally indenpendently encoded.
Each channel will have exactly half of the bitrate.
This mode is designed for applications like dual languages
encoding (for example: English in one channel and French in the other).
Using this encoding mode for regular stereo files will result in a
lower quality encoding.
<P>
<B>(mo)no</B>

<BR>

The input will be encoded as a mono signal.
If it was a stereo signal,
it will be downsampled to mono.
The downmix is calculated as the sum of the left and right channel,
attenuated by 6 dB.
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
Mix the stereo input file to mono and encode as mono.
<BR>

The downmix is calculated as the sum of the left and right channel,
attenuated by 6 dB. 
<P>
This option is only needed in the case of raw PCM stereo input
(because LAME cannot determine the number of channels in the input file).
To encode a stereo PCM input file as mono,
use
<B>lame -m</B>

<I>s</I>

<B>-a.</B>

<P>
For WAV and AIFF input files,
using
<B>-m</B>

-I m
will always produce a mono .mp3 file from both mono and stereo input. 
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Allows the left and right channels to use different block size types. 
<DT><B>--freeformat</B>

<DD>
Produces a free format bitstream.
With this option,
you can use
<B>-b</B>

with any bitrate higher than 8 kbps.
<P>
However,
even if an mp3 decoder is required to support free bitrates at
least up to 320 kbps,
many players are unable to deal with it.
<P>
Tests have shown that the following decoders support free format:
<BR>

<B>FreeAmp</B>

up to 440 kbps
<BR>

<B>in_mpg123</B>

up to 560 kbps
<BR>

<B>l3dec</B>

up to 310 kbps
<BR>

<B>LAME</B>

up to 560 kbps
<BR>

<B>MAD</B>

up to 640 kbps
<DT><B>--decode</B>

<DD>
Uses LAME for decoding to a wav file.
The input file can be any input type supported by encoding,
including layer II files.
LAME uses a bugfixed version of mpglib for decoding.
<P>
If
<B>-t</B>

is used (disable wav header),
LAME will output raw pcm in native endian format.
You can use
<B>-x</B>

to swap bytes order.
<P>
This option is not usable if the MP3 decoder was
<B>explicitly</B>

disabled in the build of LAME.
<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Disable writing of the INFO Tag on encoding.
<BR>

This tag in embedded in frame 0 of the MP3 file.
It includes some information about the encoding options of the file,
and in VBR it lets VBR aware players correctly seek and compute
playing times of VBR files.
<P>
When
<B>--decode</B>

is specified (decode to WAV),
this flag will disable writing of the WAV header.
The output will be raw pcm,
native endian format.
Use
<B>-x</B>

to swap bytes.
<DT><B>--comp</B><I> arg</I>

<DD>
Instead of choosing bitrate,
using this option,
user can choose compression ratio to achieve.
<DT><B>--scale</B><I> n</I>

<DD>

<DT><B>--scale-l</B><I> n</I>

<DD>
<DT><B>--scale-r</B><I> n</I>

<DD>
Scales input (every channel, only left channel or only right channel) by
<I>n.</I>

This just multiplies the PCM data (after it has been converted to floating
point) by
<I>n. </I>

<P>
<I>n</I>

&gt; 1: increase volume
<BR>

<I>n</I>

= 1: no effect
<BR>

<I>n</I>

&lt; 1: reduce volume
<P>
Use with care,
since most MP3 decoders will truncate data which decodes to values
greater than 32768.

<DT><B>--replaygain-fast</B>

<DD>
Compute ReplayGain fast but slightly inaccurately.
<P>
This computes &quot;Radio&quot; ReplayGain on the input data stream after
user-specified volume-scaling and/or resampling.
<P>
The ReplayGain analysis does
<I>not</I>

affect the content of a compressed data stream itself,
it is a value stored in the header of a sound file.
Information on the purpose of ReplayGain and the algorithms used is
available from
<B><A HREF="http://www.replaygain.org/.">http://www.replaygain.org/.</A></B>

<P>
Only the &quot;RadioGain&quot; Replaygain value is computed,
it is stored in the LAME tag.
The analysis is performed with the reference
volume equal to 89dB.
Note: the reference volume has been changed from 83dB on transition from
version 3.95 to 3.95.1.
<P>
This switch is enabled by default.
<P>
See also:
<B>--replaygain-accurate, --noreplaygain</B>

<DT><B>--replaygain-accurate</B>

<DD>
Compute ReplayGain more accurately and find the peak sample.
<P>
This enables decoding on the fly, computes &quot;Radio&quot; ReplayGain on the
decoded data stream,
finds the peak sample of the decoded data stream and stores it in the file.
<BR>&nbsp;
The ReplayGain analysis does

<B><A HREF="http://www.replaygain.org/.">http://www.replaygain.org/.</A></B>

<P>
<BR>&nbsp;
By default, LAME performs ReplayGain analysis on the input data
(after the user-specified volume scaling).
This behaviour might give slightly inaccurate results
because the data on the output of a lossy compression/decompression sequence
differs from the initial input data.
When
<B>--replaygain-accurate</B>

is specified the mp3 stream gets decoded on the fly and the analysis is
performed on the decoded data stream.
Although theoretically this method gives more accurate results,
it has several disadvantages:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
tests have shown that the difference between the ReplayGain values computed
on the input data and decoded data is usually not greater than 0.5dB,
although the minimum volume difference the human ear can perceive is
about 1.0dB
<DT>*<DD>
decoding on the fly significantly slows down the encoding process
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>
The apparent advantage is that:
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
with
<B>--replaygain-accurate</B>

the real peak sample is determined and stored in the file.
The knowledge of the peak sample can be useful to decoders (players)
to prevent a negative effect called 'clipping' that introduces distortion
into the sound.

Note: the reference volume has been changed from 83dB on transition from
version 3.95 to 3.95.1.
<BR>&nbsp;
This option is not usable if the MP3 decoder was
<B>explicitly</B>

disabled in the build of LAME.
(Note: if LAME is compiled without the MP3 decoder,
ReplayGain analysis is performed on the input data after user-specified
volume scaling).

<P>
Bitrate is of course the main influence on quality.
The higher the bitrate,

But for a given bitrate,
we have a choice of algorithms to determine the best scalefactors

<P>
<B>-q 0:</B>

<BR>

This switch is always enabled when using VBR. 
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
This switch forces the encoder to use a faster encoding mode,
but with a lower quality.
The behaviour is the same as the
<B>-q 7</B>

switch.
<P>
Noise shaping will be disabled,
but psycho acoustics will still be computed for bit allocation
and pre-echo detection.

ABR (average bitrate) options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--abr</B><I> n</I>

<DD>
Turns on encoding with a targeted average bitrate of n kbits,
allowing to use frames of different sizes.
The allowed range of
<I>n</I>

is 8 - 310,
you can use any integer value within that range.
<P>
It can be combined with the
<B>-b</B>

<B>-B</B>

switches like:
<B>lame --abr</B>

<I>123</I>

<B>-b</B>

<I>64</I>

<B>-B</B>

<I>192 a.wav a.mp3</I>

which would limit the allowed frame sizes between 64 and 192 kbits.
<P>
The use of
<B>-B</B>

is NOT RECOMMENDED.
A 128 kbps CBR bitstream,
because of the bit reservoir,
can actually have frames which use as many bits as a 320 kbps frame.
VBR modes minimize the use of the bit reservoir,
and thus need to allow 320 kbps frames to get the same flexibility
as CBR streams.

Invokes the newest VBR algorithm.
During the development of version 3.90,
considerable tuning was done on this algorithm,

Disable any use of the ATH (absolute threshold of hearing) for masking.
Normally,
humans are unable to hear any sound below this threshold. 
<DT><B>--athshort</B>

<DD>
Ignore psychoacoustic model for short blocks,
use ATH only. 
<DT><B>--athonly</B>

<DD>
This option causes LAME to ignore the output of the psy-model and only
use masking from the ATH (absolute threshold of hearing).
Might be useful at very high bitrates or for testing the ATH. 
<DT><B>--athtype</B><I> shape</I>

<DD>
The Absolute Threshold of Hearing is the minimum threshold under which
humans are unable to hear any sound.
<BR>

In the past,
LAME was using ATH shape 0 which is the Painter &amp; Spanias formula.
Tests have shown that this formula is innacurate for the
13 - 22 kHz area,
leading to audible artifacts in some cases.
<BR>

Shape 1 was thus implemented,
which is over sensitive,
leading to very high bitrates.
<BR>

Shape 2 formula was accurately modelized from real data in order to
reach optimal quality while not wasting bitrate.
In CBR and ABR modes,
LAME uses ATH shape 2 by default,
VBR selects one depending on the specified parameter to the

<DT><B>--noshort</B>

<DD>
Encode all frames using long blocks only.
This could increase quality when encoding at very low bitrates,

When LAME searches for a &quot;good&quot; quantization,
it has to compare the actual one with the best one found so far. 
The comparison says which one is better,
the best so far or the actual.
The
<B>-X</B>

parameter selects between different approaches to make this decision,
<B>-X0</B>

beeing the default mode:
<P>
<B>-X0 </B>

<BR>

The criterions are (in order of importance):
<BR>

* less distorted scalefactor bands
<BR>

* the sum of noise over the thresholds is lower
<BR>

* the total noise is lower
<P>
<B>-X1</B>

<BR>

The actual is better if the maximum noise over all scalefactor bands is
less than the best so far.
<P>
<B>-X2</B>

<BR>

The actual is better if the total sum of noise is lower than the best so
far.
<P>
<B>-X3</B>

<BR>

The actual is better if the total sum of noise is lower than the best so
far and the maximum noise over all scalefactor bands is less than the
best so far plus 2dB.
<P>
<B>-X4</B>

<BR>

Not yet documented.
<P>

<BR>

5 = 0/15 microseconds
<BR>

c = citt j.17
<P>
All this does is set a flag in the bitstream.
If you have a PCM input file where one of the above types of
(obsolete) emphasis has been applied,
you can set this flag in LAME.
Then the mp3 decoder should de-emphasize the output during playback,
although most decoders ignore this flag.
<P>
A better solution would be to apply the de-emphasis with a standalone
utility before encoding,
and then encode without
<B>-e. </B>

<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Mark the encoded file as being copyrighted.
<DT><B>-o</B>

<DD>
Mark the encoded file as being a copy. 
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Turn on CRC error protection.
<BR>

It will add a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code in each frame,
allowing to detect transmission errors that could occur on the
MP3 stream.
However,
it takes 16 bits per frame that would otherwise be used for encoding,
and then will slightly reduce the sound quality. 
<DT><B>--nores</B>

<DD>
Disable the bit reservoir.
Each frame will then become independent from previous ones,
but the quality will be lower. 
<DT><B>--strictly-enforce-ISO</B>

<DD>
With this option,
LAME will enforce the 7680 bit limitation on total frame size.
<BR>

This results in many wasted bits for high bitrate encodings but will
ensure strict ISO compatibility.
This compatibility might be important for hardware players.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

Filter options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-k</B>

<DD>
Tells the encoder to use full bandwidth and to disable all filters.
By default,
the encoder uses some highpass filtering at low bitrates,
in order to keep a good quality by giving more bits to more important
frequencies.
<BR>

Increasing the bandwidth from the default setting might produce
ringing artefacts at low bitrates.
Use with care! 
<DT><B>--lowpass</B><I> freq</I>

<DD>
Set a lowpass filtering frequency in kHz.
Frequencies above the specified one will be cutoff. 
<DT><B>--lowpass-width</B><I> freq</I>

<DD>
Set the width of the lowpass filter.
The default value is 15% of the lowpass frequency. 
<DT><B>--highpass</B><I> freq</I>

<DD>
Set an highpass filtering frequency in kHz.
Frequencies below the specified one will be cutoff. 
<DT><B>--highpass-width</B><I> freq</I>

<DD>
Set the width of the highpass filter in kHz.
The default value is 15% of the highpass frequency.
<DT><B>--resample</B><I> sfreq</I>

<DD>
<I>sfreq</I>

<H2>ID3 TAGS</H2>

LAME is able to embed ID3 v1,
v1.1 or v2 tags inside the encoded MP3 file.
This allows to have some usefull information about the music track
included inside the file.
Those data can be read by most MP3 players.
<P>
Lame will smartly choose wich tags to use.
It will add ID3 v2 tags only if the input comments won't fit in v1
or v1.1 tags,
i.e. if they are more than 30 characters.
In this case,
both v1 and v2 tags will be added,
to ensure reading of tags by MP3 players wich are unable to read ID3 v2 tags.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENCODING MODES</H2>

LAME is able to encode your music using one of its 3 encoding modes:
constant bitrate (CBR), average bitrate (ABR) and variable bitrate (VBR).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Constant Bitrate (CBR)</B>

<DD>
This is the default encoding mode,
and also the most basic.
In this mode,
the bitrate will be the same for the whole file.
It means that each part of your mp3 file will be using the same
number of bits.
The musical passage beeing a difficult one to encode or an easy one,
the encoder will use the same bitrate,
so the quality of your mp3 is variable.
Complex parts will be of a lower quality than the easiest ones.
The main advantage is that the final files size won't change and
can be accurately predicted.
<DT><B>Average Bitrate (ABR)</B>

<DD>
In this mode,
you choose the encoder will maintain an average bitrate while using
higher bitrates for the parts of your music that need more bits.
The result will be of higher quality than CBR encoding but the
average file size will remain predictible,
so this mode is highly recommended over CBR.
This encoding mode is similar to what is reffered as vbr in AAC or
Liquid Audio (2 other compression technologies).
<DT><B>Variable bitrate (VBR)</B>

<DD>
In this mode,
you choose the desired quality on a scale from 9 (lowest
quality/biggest distortion) to 0 (highest quality/lowest distortion).
Then encoder tries to maintain the given quality in the whole file by
choosing the optimal number of bits to spend for each part of your music.
The main advantage is that you are able to specify the quality level that
you want to reach,
but the inconvenient is that the final file size is totally unpredictible.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PRESETS</H2>

The
<B>--preset</B>

switches are designed to provide the highest possible quality.
<P>
They have for the most part been subject to and tuned via rigorous double blind
listening tests to verify and achieve this objective.
<P>
These are continually updated to coincide with the latest developments that
occur and as a result should provide you with nearly the best quality
currently possible from LAME.
<P>
To activate these prests:
<P>

For VBR modes (generally highest quality):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--preset standard</B>

<DD>
This preset should generally be transparent to most people on most music and
is already quite high in quality.
<DT><B>--preset extreme</B>

<DD>
If you have extremely good hearing and similar equipment,
this preset will generally provide slightly higher quality than the
<B>standard</B>

mode.
</DL>
<P>

For CBR 320kbps (highest quality possible from the
<B>--preset</B>

switches):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--preset insane</B>

<DD>
This preset will usually be overkill for most people and most situations,
but if you must have the absolute highest quality with no regard to filesize,
this is the way to go.
</DL>
<P>

For ABR modes (high quality per given bitrate but not as high as VBR):
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--preset  kbps</B>

<DD>
Using this preset will usually give you good quality at a specified bitrate.
Depending on the bitrate entered,
this preset will determine the optimal settings for that particular situation.
While this approach works,
it is not nearly as flexible as VBR,
and usually will not attain the same level of quality as VBR at higher bitrates.
</DL>
<P>

The following options are also available for the corresponding profiles:
<P>

<B>fast standard|extreme|insane</B>

<BR>

<B>cbr  kbps</B>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>fast</B>

<DD>
Enables the new fast VBR for a particular profile.
The disadvantage to the speed switch is that often times the bitrate will be
slightly higher than with the normal mode and quality may be slightly lower also.
<DT><B>cbr</B>

<DD>
If you use the ABR mode (read above) with a significant bitrate such as 80,
96,
112,
128,
160,
192,
224,
256,
320,
you can use the
<B>cbr</B>

option to force CBR mode encoding instead of the standard ABR mode.
ABR does provide higher quality but CBR may be useful in situations such as when
streaming an MP3 over the internet may be important.
