<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>



<B></B>


is a program designed to simplify the maintenance of other programs.
Its input is a list of specifications as to the files upon which programs
and other files depend.
If the file
`makefile

'

exists, it is read for this list of specifications.
If it does not exist, the file
`Makefile

'

is read.
If the file
`.depend

'

exists, it is read (see
<A HREF="../man1/mkdep.1.php">mkdep</A>(1)).


<P>

This manual page is intended as a reference document only.
For a more thorough description of

<DD>
Rather than re-building a target as specified in the makefile, create it
or update its modification time to make it appear up-to-date.
<DT><B>-V </B><I>variable</I>




<DD>
Print
<B>'s</B>



idea of the value of
<I>variable</I>

 
in the global context.

Multiple instances of this option may be specified;
the variables will be printed one per line,
with a blank line for each null or undefined variable.
<DT><B></B><I>variable=value</I>


<DD>
Set the value of the variable
<I>variable</I>

to
<I>value</I>

 
</DL>
<P>

<P>

There are seven different types of lines in a makefile: file dependency
specifications, shell commands, variable assignments, include statements,
conditional directives, for loops, and comments.
<P>

In general, lines may be continued from one line to the next by ending
them with a backslash
(`\'

)

 
The trailing newline character and initial whitespace on the following
line are compressed into a single space.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILE DEPENDENCY SPECIFICATIONS</H2>

Dependency lines consist of one or more targets, an operator, and zero
or more sources.
This creates a relationship where the targets ``depend'' on the sources
and are usually created from them.
The exact relationship between the target and the source is determined
by the operator that separates them.
The three operators are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>:</B>


<DD>
A target is considered out-of-date if its modification time is less than
those of any of its sources.
Sources for a target accumulate over dependency lines when this operator
is used.
The target is removed if
<B></B>


is interrupted.
<DT><B>!</B>


<DD>
Targets are always re-created, but not until all sources have been
examined and re-created as necessary.
Sources for a target accumulate over dependency lines when this operator
is used.
The target is removed if
<B></B>


is interrupted.
<DT><B>::</B>


<DD>
If no sources are specified, the target is always re-created.
Otherwise, a target is considered out-of-date if any of its sources has
been modified more recently than the target.
Sources for a target do not accumulate over dependency lines when this
operator is used.
The target will not be removed if
<B></B>


is interrupted.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Targets and sources may contain the shell wildcard values
`?'

,
`*'

,
`[]'

and
`{}'

The values
`?'

,
`*'

and
`[]'

may only be used as part of the final
component of the target or source, and must be used to describe existing
files.
The value
`{}'

need not necessarily be used to describe existing files.
Expansion is in directory order, not alphabetically as done in the shell.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SHELL COMMANDS</H2>

Each target may have associated with it a series of shell commands, normally
used to create the target.
Each of the commands in this script
<I>must</I>

be preceded by a tab.
While any target may appear on a dependency line, only one of these
dependencies may be followed by a creation script, unless the
`<B>::</B>

'

operator is used.
<P>

If the first or first two characters of the command line are
`<B>@</B>

'

and/or
`<B>-</B>

'

,
the command is treated specially.
A
`<B>@</B>

'

causes the command not to be echoed before it is executed.
A
`<B>-</B>

'

causes any non-zero exit status of the command line to be ignored.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS</H2>

Variables in make are much like variables in the shell, and, by tradition,
consist of all upper-case letters.
The five operators that can be used to assign values to variables are as
follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>=</B>


<DD>
Assign the value to the variable.
Any previous value is overridden.
<DT><B>+=</B>


<DD>
Append the value to the current value of the variable.
<DT><B>?=</B>


<DD>
Assign the value to the variable if it is not already defined.
<DT><B>:=</B>


<DD>
Assign with expansion, i.e. expand the value before assigning it
to the variable.
Normally, expansion is not done until the variable is referenced.
<DT><B>!=</B>


<DD>
Expand the value and pass it to the shell for execution and assign
the result to the variable.
Any newlines in the result are replaced with spaces.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Any white-space before the assigned
<I>value</I>

is removed; if the value is being appended, a single space is inserted
between the previous contents of the variable and the appended value.
<P>

Variables are expanded by surrounding the variable name with either
curly braces
(`{}'

)

or parentheses
(`()'

)

and preceding it with
a dollar sign
(`$'

)

 
If the variable name contains only a single letter, the surrounding
braces or parentheses are not required.
This shorter form is not recommended.
<P>

Variable substitution occurs at two distinct times, depending on where
the variable is being used.
Variables in dependency lines are expanded as the line is read.
Variables in shell commands are expanded when the shell command is
executed.
<P>

The four different classes of variables (in order of increasing precedence)
are:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>Environment variables</B>
<DD>
Variables defined as part of
<B>'s</B>



environment.
<DT><B>Global variables</B>
<DD>
Variables defined in the makefile or in included makefiles.
<DT><B>Command line variables</B>
<DD>
Variables defined as part of the command line.
<DT><B>Local variables</B>
<DD>
Variables that are defined specific to a certain target.
The seven local variables are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B></B><I>.ALLSRC</I>


<DD>
The list of all sources for this target; also known as
`<I>&gt;</I>

'

<DT><B></B><I>.ARCHIVE</I>


<DD>
The name of the archive file.
<DT><B></B><I>.IMPSRC</I>


<DD>
The name/path of the source from which the target is to be transformed
(the ``implied'' source); also known as
`<I>&lt;</I>

'

<DT><B></B><I>.MEMBER</I>


<DD>
The name of the archive member.
<DT><B></B><I>.OODATE</I>


<DD>
The list of sources for this target that were deemed out-of-date; also
known as
`<I>?</I>

'

<DT><B></B><I>.PREFIX</I>


<DD>
The file prefix of the file, containing only the file portion, no suffix
or preceding directory components; also known as
`<I>*</I>

'

<DT><B></B><I>.TARGET</I>


<DD>
The name of the target; also known as
`<I>@</I>

'

</DL>
<P>

<P>

The shorter forms
`<I>@</I>

'

,
`<I>?</I>

'

,
`<I>&gt;</I>

'

and
`<I>*</I>

'

are permitted for backward
compatibility with historical makefiles and are not recommended.
The six variables
`<I>@F</I>

'

,
`<I>@D</I>

'

,
`<I>&lt;F</I>

'

,
`<I>&lt;D</I>

'

,
`<I>*F</I>

'

and
`<I>*D</I>

'

are
permitted for compatibility with
AT&amp;T System
V
makefiles and are not recommended.
<P>

Four of the local variables may be used in sources on dependency lines
because they expand to the proper value for each target on the line.
These variables are
`<I>.TARGET</I>

'

,
`<I>.PREFIX</I>

'

,
`<I>.ARCHIVE</I>

'

,
and
`<I>.MEMBER</I>

'

<P>

In addition,
<B></B>


sets or knows about the following variables:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B></B><I>$</I>


<DD>
A single dollar sign
`$'

,
i.e.
`$$'

expands to a single dollar
sign.
<DT><B></B><I>.MAKE</I>


<DD>
The name that
<B></B>


was executed with
(<I>argv[0]</I>

)

<DT><B></B><I>.CURDIR</I>


<DD>
A path to the directory where
<B></B>


was executed.
<DT><B></B><I>.OBJDIR</I>


<DD>
A path to the directory where the targets are built.
<DT><B>MAKEFLAGS</B>


<DD>
The environment variable
`<B>MAKEFLAGS</B>

'

may contain anything that
may be specified on
<B>'s</B>



command line.
Anything specified on
<B>'s</B>



command line is appended to the
`<B>MAKEFLAGS</B>

'

variable which is then
entered into the environment for all programs which
<B></B>


executes.
<DT><B>PWD</B>


<DD>
Alternate path to the current directory.
<B></B>


normally sets
`<I>.CURDIR</I>

'

to the canonical path given by
<A HREF="../man2/getcwd.2.php">getcwd</A>(2).


However, if the environment variable
`<B>PWD</B>

'

is set and gives a path to the current directory, then
<B></B>


sets
`<I>.CURDIR</I>

'

to the value of
`<B>PWD</B>

'

instead.
`<B>PWD</B>

'

is set to the value of
`<I>.OBJDIR</I>

'

for all programs which
<B></B>


executes.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Variable expansion may be modified to select or modify each word of the
variable (where a ``word'' is white-space delimited sequence of characters).
The general format of a variable expansion is as follows:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>{variable[:modifier[:...]]}</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

Each modifier begins with a colon and one of the following
special characters.
The colon may be escaped with a backslash
(`\'

)

 
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>E</B>


<DD>
Replaces each word in the variable with its suffix.
<DT><B>H</B>


<DD>
Replaces each word in the variable with everything but the last component.
<DT><B>M </B><I>pattern</I>






<DD>
Select only those words that match the rest of the modifier.
The standard shell wildcard characters
( `*'



 
`?'

,
and
`[)]

'

may
be used.
The wildcard characters may be escaped with a backslash
(`\'

)

 
<DT><B>N </B><I>pattern</I>






<DD>
This is identical to
`<B>M</B>

'

,
but selects all words which do not match
the rest of the modifier.
<DT><B>Q</B>


<DD>
Quotes every shell meta-character in the variable, so that it can be passed
safely through recursive invocations of
<B>.</B>

<DT><B>R</B>


<DD>
Replaces each word in the variable with everything but its suffix.

<DT><B>S / </B><I>old_string 
</I>







<B>/ </B><I>new_string</I>



<B>/ </B>[<B>1g</B>

]



<DD>


<DD>Modify the first occurrence of
<I>old_string</I>

in the variable's value, replacing it with
<I>new_string</I>

 
If a
`g'

is appended to the last slash of the pattern, all occurrences
in each word are replaced.
If a
`1'

is appended to the last slash of the pattern, only the first word
is affected.
If
<I>old_string</I>

begins with a caret
(`^'

)

 
<I>old_string</I>

is anchored at the beginning of each word.
If
<I>old_string</I>

ends with a dollar sign
(`$'

)

 
it is anchored at the end of each word.
Inside
<I>new_string</I>

 
an ampersand
(`&amp;'

)

is replaced by
<I>old_string</I>

(without any
`^'

or
`$'

) .
Any character may be used as a delimiter for the parts of the modifier
string.
The anchoring, ampersand and delimiter characters may be escaped with a
backslash
(`\'

)

 
<P>

Variable expansion occurs in the normal fashion inside both
<I>old_string</I>

and
<I>new_string</I>

with the single exception that a backslash is used to prevent the expansion
of a dollar sign
(`$'

)

 
not a preceding dollar sign as is usual.

<DT><B>C / </B><I>pattern 
</I>







<B>/ </B><I>replacement</I>



<B>/ </B>[<B>1g</B>

]



<DD>


<DD>The
<B>C</B>

modifier is just like the
<B>S</B>

modifier except that the the old and new strings, instead of being
simple strings, are a regular expression (see
<A HREF="../man3/regex.3.php">regex</A>(3))


and an
<A HREF="../man1/ed.1.php">ed</A>(1)Ns-style


replacement string.  Normally, the first occurrence of the pattern in
each word of the value is changed.  The
`1'

modifier causes the substitution to apply to at most one word; the
`g'

modifier causes the substitution to apply to as many instances of the
search pattern as occur in the word or words it is found in.  Note that
`1'

and
`g'

are orthogonal; the former specifies whether multiple words are
potentially affected, the latter whether multiple substitutions can
potentially occur within each affected word.
<DT><B>T</B>


<DD>
Replaces each word in the variable with its last component.
<DT><B>? </B><I>true_string : false_string</I>








<DD>
If the variable evaluates to true, return as its value the
<I>true_string,</I>

otherwise return the
<I>false_string.</I>

<DT><B></B><I>old_string=new_string</I>


<DD>
This is the
AT&amp;T System
V
style variable substitution.
It must be the last modifier specified.
If
<I>old_string</I>

or
<I>new_string</I>

do not contain the pattern matching character
<I>%</I>

then it is assumed that they are
anchored at the end of each word, so only suffixes or entire
words may be replaced. Otherwise
<I>%</I>

is the substring of
<I>old_string</I>

to be replaced in
<I>new_string</I>

<H2>INCLUDE STATEMENTS, CONDITIONALS AND FOR LOOPS</H2>

Makefile inclusion, conditional structures and for loops  reminiscent
of the C programming language are provided in
<B>.</B>

All such structures are identified by a line beginning with a single
dot
(`.'

)

character.
Files are included with either
<B>.include Aq </B><I>file</I>





or
<B>.include  </B><I>file </I><B></B>







 
Variables between the angle brackets or double quotes are expanded
to form the file name.
If angle brackets are used, the included makefile is expected to be in
the system makefile directory.
If double quotes are used, the including makefile's directory and any
directories specified using the
-<B>I</B>

option are searched before the system
makefile directory.
For compatibility with other versions of
<B></B>


`include'

file ...
is also accepted. If the include statement is written as
<B>.-include</B>

or as
<B>.sinclude</B>

then errors locating and/or opening include files are ignored.
<P>

Conditional expressions are also preceded by a single dot as the first
character of a line.
The possible conditionals are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>

will only evaluate a conditional as far as is necessary to determine
its value.
Parentheses may be used to change the order of evaluation.
The boolean operator
`<B>!</B>

'

may be used to logically negate an entire
conditional.
It is of higher precedence than
`<B>&amp;&amp;</B>

'

<P>

The value of
<I>expression</I>

may be any of the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>defined</B>


<DD>
Takes a variable name as an argument and evaluates to true if the variable
has been defined.
<DT><B>make</B>


<DD>
Takes a target name as an argument and evaluates to true if the target
was specified as part of
<B>'s</B>



command line or was declared the default target (either implicitly or
explicitly, see
<I>.MAIN</I>

 
before the line containing the conditional.
<DT><B>empty</B>


<DD>
Takes a variable, with possible modifiers, and evaluates to true if
the expansion of the variable would result in an empty string.
<DT><B>exists</B>


<DD>
Takes a file name as an argument and evaluates to true if the file exists.
The file is searched for on the system search path (see
<I>.PATH )</I>

 
<DT><B>target</B>


<DD>
Takes a target name as an argument and evaluates to true if the target
has been defined.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

<I>Expression</I>

may also be an arithmetic or string comparison.  Variable expansion is
performed on both sides of the comparison, after which the integral
values are compared.  A value is interpreted as hexadecimal if it is
preceded by 0x, otherwise it is decimal; octal numbers are not supported.
The standard C relational operators are all supported.  If after
variable expansion, either the left or right hand side of a
`<B>==</B>

'

or
`<B>!=</B>

'

operator is not an integral value, then
string comparison is performed between the expanded
variables.
If no relational operator is given, it is assumed that the expanded
variable is being compared against 0.
<P>

When
<B></B>


is evaluating one of these conditional expression, and it encounters
a word it doesn't recognize, either the ``make'' or ``defined''
expression is applied to it, depending on the form of the conditional.
If the form is
`<B>.ifdef</B>

'

or
`<B>.ifndef</B>

'

,
the ``defined'' expression
is applied.
Similarly, if the form is
`<B>.ifmake</B>

'

or
`<B>.ifnmake</B>

'

, the ``make''
expression is applied.
<P>

If the conditional evaluates to true the parsing of the makefile continues
as before.
If it evaluates to false, the following lines are skipped.
In both cases this continues until a
`<B>.else</B>

'

or
`<B>.endif</B>

'

is found.
<P>

For loops are typically used to apply a set of rules to a list of files.
The syntax of a for loop is:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>
</B>

<B>.for</B>

<I>variable</I>

<B>in</B>

<I>expression</I>

<DD>

<DT><B>
</B>

&lt;make-rules&gt;
<DD>

<DT><B>
</B>

<B>.endfor</B>

<DD>

</DL>
<P>

<DD>After the for
<B>expression</B>

is evaluated, it is split into words. The
iteration
<B>variable</B>

is successively set to each word, and substituted in the
<B>make-rules</B>

inside the body of the for loop.

character, anywhere but in a shell
command line, and continue to the end of the line.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SPECIAL SOURCES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>.IGNORE</B>


<DD>
Ignore any errors from the commands associated with this target, exactly
as if they all were preceded by a dash
(`-'

)

 
<DT><B>.MADE</B>


<DD>
Mark all sources of this target as being up-to-date. 
<DT><B>.MAKE</B>


<DD>
Execute the commands associated with this target even if the
-<B>n</B>

or
-<B>t</B>

options were specified.
Normally used to mark recursive
<B>'s</B>



 
<DT><B>.NOTMAIN</B>


<DD>
Normally
<B></B>


selects the first target it encounters as the default target to be built
if no target was specified.
This source prevents this target from being selected.
<DT><B>.OPTIONAL</B>


<DD>
If a target is marked with this attribute and
<B></B>


can't figure out how to create it, it will ignore this fact and assume
the file isn't needed or already exists.
<DT><B>.PRECIOUS</B>


<DD>
When
<B></B>


is interrupted, it removes any partially made targets.
This source prevents the target from being removed.
<DT><B>.SILENT</B>


<DD>
Do not echo any of the commands associated with this target, exactly
as if they all were preceded by an at sign
(`@'

)

 
<DT><B>.USE</B>


<DD>
Turn the target into
<B>'s</B>



version of a macro.
When the target is used as a source for another target, the other target
acquires the commands, sources, and attributes (except for
<B>.USE</B>

 
of the
source.
If the target already has commands, the
<B>.USE</B>

target's commands are appended
to them.
<DT><B>.WAIT</B>


<DD>
If special
<B>.WAIT</B>

source is appears in a dependency line, the sources that precede it are
made before the sources that succeed it in the line. Loops are not being
detected and targets that form loops will be silently ignored.

<H2>SPECIAL TARGETS</H2>

Special targets may not be included with other targets, i.e. they must be
the only target specified.
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>.BEGIN</B>


<DD>
Any command lines attached to this target are executed before anything
else is done.
<DT><B>.DEFAULT</B>


<DD>
This is sort of a
<B>.USE</B>

rule for any target (that was used only as a
source) that
<B></B>


can't figure out any other way to create.
Only the shell script is used.
The
<B>.IMPSRC</B>

variable of a target that inherits
<B>.DEFAULT 's</B>



commands is set
to the target's own name.
<DT><B>.END</B>


<DD>
Any command lines attached to this target are executed after everything
else is done.
<DT><B>.IGNORE</B>


<DD>
Mark each of the sources with the
<B>.IGNORE</B>

attribute.
If no sources are specified, this is the equivalent of specifying the
-<B>i</B>

option.
<DT><B>.INTERRUPT</B>


<DD>
If
<B></B>


is interrupted, the commands for this target will be executed.
<DT><B>.MAIN</B>


<DD>
If no target is specified when
<B></B>


is invoked, this target will be built.
<DT><B>.MAKEFLAGS</B>


<DD>
This target provides a way to specify flags for
<B></B>


when the makefile is used.
The flags are as if typed to the shell, though the
-<B>f</B>

option will have
no effect.




<DT><B>.NOPATH</B>


<DD>
Apply the
<B>.NOPATH</B>

attribute to any specified sources. Targets with this attribute are not
searched for in the directories specified by
<B>.PATH</B>

 
<DT><B>.NOTPARALLEL</B>


<DD>
Disable parallel mode.
<DT><B>.NO_PARALLEL</B>


<DD>
Same as above, for compatibility with other pmake variants.
<DT><B>.ORDER</B>


<DD>
The named targets are made in sequence.




<DT><B>.PATH</B>


<DD>
The sources are directories which are to be searched for files not
found in the current directory.
If no sources are specified, any previously specified directories are
deleted.
<DT><B>.PHONY</B>


<DD>
Apply the
<B>.PHONY</B>

attribute to any specified sources. Targets with this attribute do not
correspond to actual files; they are always considered to be out of date,
and will not be created with the
-<B>t</B>

option.
<DT><B>.PRECIOUS</B>


<DD>
Apply the
<B>.PRECIOUS</B>

attribute to any specified sources.
If no sources are specified, the
<B>.PRECIOUS</B>

attribute is applied to every
target in the file.
<DT><B>.SILENT</B>


<DD>
Apply the
<B>.SILENT</B>

attribute to any specified sources.
If no sources are specified, the
<B>.SILENT</B>

attribute is applied to every
command in the file.
<DT><B>.SUFFIXES</B>


<DD>
Each source specifies a suffix to
<B>.</B>

If no sources are specified, any previous specified suffices are deleted.
