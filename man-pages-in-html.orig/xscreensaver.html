<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

xscreensaver - extensible screen saver framework, plus locking
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>xscreensaver</B>

[-display <I>host:display.screen</I>] [-verbose] [-no-capture-stderr] [-no-splash]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The <I>xscreensaver</I> program waits until the keyboard and mouse have been 
idle for a period, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random.  It 
turns off as soon as there is any mouse or keyboard activity.
<P>
This program can lock your terminal in order to prevent others from using it,
though its default mode of operation is merely to display pretty pictures on
your screen when it is not in use.
<P>
It also provides configuration and control of your monitor's power-saving
features.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GETTING STARTED</H2>

For the impatient, try this:


<P>


<PRE>
xscreensaver &amp;
xscreensaver-demo

</PRE>


<P>



The
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

program pops up a dialog box that lets you configure the screen saver,
and experiment with the various display modes.
<P>
<B>Note:</B>

unlike
<B><A HREF="../man1/xlock.1.php">xlock</A></B>(1),

xscreensaver has a client-server model: the <I>xscreensaver</I> program is a
daemon that runs in the background; it is controlled by the foreground
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-command.1.php">xscreensaver-command</A></B>(1)

programs.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

The easiest way to configure <I>xscreensaver</I> is to simply run the
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

program, and change the settings through the GUI.  The rest of this
manual page describes lower level ways of changing settings.
<P>
I'll repeat that because it's important:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The easy way to configure xscreensaver is to run the 
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

program.  You shouldn't need to know any of the stuff described 
in <I>this</I> manual unless you are trying to do something tricky,
like customize xscreensaver for site-wide use or something.
</DL>

<P>
Options to <I>xscreensaver</I> are stored in one of two places: in 
a <I>.xscreensaver</I> file in your home directory; or in the X resource
database.  If the <I>.xscreensaver</I> file exists, it overrides any settings
in the resource database.  
<P>
The syntax of the <I>.xscreensaver</I> file is similar to that of
the <I>.Xdefaults</I> file; for example, to set the <I>timeout</I> paramter
in the <I>.xscreensaver</I> file, you would write the following:


<P>


<PRE>
timeout: 5

</PRE>


<P>



whereas, in the <I>.Xdefaults</I> file, you would write


<P>


<PRE>
xscreensaver.timeout: 5

</PRE>


<P>



If you change a setting in the <I>.xscreensaver</I> file while xscreensaver
is already running, it will notice this, and reload the file.  (The file will
be reloaded the next time the screen saver needs to take some action, such as
blanking or unblanking the screen, or picking a new graphics mode.)
<P>
If you change a setting in your X resource database, or if you want
xscreensaver to notice your changes immediately instead of the next time
it wakes up, then you will need to reload your <I>.Xdefaults</I> file,
and then tell the running xscreensaver process to restart itself, like so:


<P>


<PRE>
xrdb &lt; ~/.Xdefaults
xscreensaver-command -restart

</PRE>


<P>



If you want to set the system-wide defaults, then make your edits to
the xscreensaver app-defaults file, which should have been installed
when xscreensaver itself was installed.  The app-defaults file will
usually be named /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver, but different
systems might keep it in a different place (for example,
/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/XScreenSaver on Solaris.)
<P>
When settings are changed in the Preferences dialog box (see above)
the current settings will be written to the <I>.xscreensaver</I> file.
(The <I>.Xdefaults</I> file and the app-defaults file will never be
written by xscreensaver itself.)
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>timeout</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
The screensaver will activate (blank the screen) after the keyboard and
mouse have been idle for this many minutes.  Default 10 minutes.
<DT><B>cycle</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
After the screensaver has been running for this many minutes, the currently
running graphics-hack sub-process will be killed (with <B>SIGTERM</B>), and a
new one started.  If this is 0, then the graphics hack will never be changed:
only one demo will run until the screensaver is deactivated by user activity.
Default 10 minutes.
<DT><B>lock</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
Enable locking: before the screensaver will turn off, it will require you 
to type the password of the logged-in user (really, the person who ran
xscreensaver), or the root password.  (<B>Note:</B> this doesn't work if the
screensaver is launched by
<B><A HREF="../man1/xdm.1.php">xdm</A></B>(1)

because it can't know the user-id of the logged-in user.  See 
the ``<I>Using <A HREF="../man1/XDM.1.php">XDM</A>(1)</I>'' section, below.
<DT><B>lockTimeout</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
If locking is enabled, this controls the length of the ``grace period''
between when the screensaver activates, and when the screen becomes locked.
For example, if this is 5, and <I>-timeout</I> is 10, then after 10 minutes,
the screen would blank.  If there was user activity at 12 minutes, no password
would be required to un-blank the screen.  But, if there was user activity
at 15 minutes or later (that is, <I>-lock-timeout</I> minutes after 
activation) then a password would be required.  The default is 0, meaning
that if locking is enabled, then a password will be required as soon as the 
screen blanks.
<DT><B>passwdTimeout</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
If the screen is locked, then this is how many seconds the password dialog box
should be left on the screen before giving up (default 30 seconds.)  This
should not be too large: the X server is grabbed for the duration that the
password dialog box is up (for security purposes) and leaving the server 
grabbed for too long can cause problems.
<DT><B>dpmsEnabled</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
Whether power management is enabled.
<DT><B>dpmsStandby</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor goes solid black.
<DT><B>dpmsSuspend</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor goes into
power-saving mode.
<DT><B>dpmsOff</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor powers down
completely.  Note that these settings will have no effect unless both
the X server and the display hardware support power management; not 
all do.  See the <I>Power Management</I> section, below, for more 
information.
<DT><B>visualID</B> (class <B>VisualID</B>)

<DD>
Specify which X visual to use by default.  (Note carefully that this resource
is called <B>visualID</B>, not merely <B>visual</B>; if you set the <B>visual</B>
resource instead, things will malfunction in obscure ways for obscure reasons.)
<P>
Legal values for the <B>VisualID</B> resource are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>default</B>

<DD>
Use the screen's default visual (the visual of the root window.)  
This is the default.
<DT><B>best</B>

<DD>
Use the visual which supports the most colors.  Note, however, that the
visual with the most colors might be a TrueColor visual, which does not
support colormap animation.  Some programs have more interesting behavior
when run on PseudoColor visuals than on TrueColor.
<DT><B>mono</B>

<DD>
Use a monochrome visual, if there is one.
<DT><B>gray</B>

<DD>
Use a grayscale or staticgray visual, if there is one and it has more than
one plane (that is, it's not monochrome.)
<DT><B>color</B>

<DD>
Use the best of the color visuals, if there are any.
<DT><B>GL</B>

<DD>
Use the visual that is best for OpenGL programs.  (OpenGL programs have
somewhat different requirements than other X programs.)
<DT><I>class</I>

<DD>
where <I>class</I> is one of <B>StaticGray</B>, <B>StaticColor</B>, 
<B>TrueColor</B>, <B>GrayScale</B>, <B>PseudoColor</B>, or <B>DirectColor</B>.
Selects the deepest visual of the given class.
<DT><I>number</I>

<DD>
where <I>number</I> (decimal or hex) is interpreted as a visual id number, 
as reported by the
<B><A HREF="../man1/xdpyinfo.1.php">xdpyinfo</A></B>(1)

program; in this way you can have finer control over exactly which visual
gets used, for example, to select a shallower one than would otherwise
have been chosen.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Note that this option specifies only the <I>default</I> visual that will
be used: the visual used may be overridden on a program-by-program basis.
See the description of the <B>programs</B> resource, below.
</DL>

<DT><B>installColormap</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
On PseudoColor (8-bit) displays, install a private colormap while the
screensaver is active, so that the graphics hacks can get as many
colors as possible.  This is the default.  (This only applies when the
screen's default visual is being used, since non-default visuals get
their own colormaps automatically.)  This can also be overridden on a
per-hack basis: see the discussion of the <B>default-n</B> name in the
section about the <B>programs</B> resource.
<P>
This does nothing if you have a TrueColor (16-bit or deeper) display.
<DT><B>verbose</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
Whether to print diagnostics.  Default false.
<DT><B>timestamp</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
Whether to print the time of day along with any other diagnostic messages.
Default true.
<DT><B>splash</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
Whether to display a splash screen at startup.  Default true.
<DT><B>splashDuration</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
How long the splash screen should remain visible; default 5 seconds.
<DT><B>quad</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
If true, then <I>four</I> screensavers will be run on each monitor.
Use at your own risk!
<DT><B>helpURL</B> (class <B>URL</B>)

<DD>
The splash screen has a <I>Help</I> button on it.  When you press it, it will
display the web page indicated here in your web browser.
<DT><B>loadURL</B> (class <B>LoadURL</B>)

<DD>
This is the shell command used to load a URL into your web browser.
The default setting will load it into Mozilla/Netscape if it is already
running, otherwise, will launch a new browser looking at the <I>helpURL</I>.
<DT><B>demoCommand</B> (class <B>DemoCommand</B>)

<DD>
This is the shell command run when the <I>Demo</I> button on the splash window
is pressed.  It defaults to
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1).

<DT><B>prefsCommand</B> (class <B>PrefsCommand</B>)

<DD>
This is the shell command run when the <I>Prefs</I> button on the splash window
is pressed.  It defaults to <I>xscreensaver-demo&nbsp;-prefs</I>.
<DT><B>nice</B> (class <B>Nice</B>)

<DD>
The sub-processes created by <I>xscreensaver</I> will be ``niced'' to this
level, so that they are given lower priority than other processes on the
system, and don't increase the load unnecessarily.  The default is 10.  
<P>
(Higher numbers mean lower priority; see 
<B><A HREF="../man1/nice.1.php">nice</A></B>(1)

for details.)
<DT><B>fade</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
If this is true, then when the screensaver activates, the current contents
of the screen will fade to black instead of simply winking out.  This only
works on certain systems.  A fade will also be done when switching graphics
hacks (when the <I>cycle</I> timer expires.)  Default: true.  
<DT><B>unfade</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
If this is true, then when the screensaver deactivates, the original contents
of the screen will fade in from black instead of appearing immediately.  This
only works on certain systems, and if <I>fade</I> is true as well.
Default false.
<DT><B>fadeSeconds</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
If <I>fade</I> is true, this is how long the fade will be in 
seconds (default 3 seconds.)
<DT><B>fadeTicks</B> (class <B>Integer</B>)

<DD>
If <I>fade</I> is true, this is how many times a second the colormap will
be changed to effect a fade.  Higher numbers yield smoother fades, but
may make the fades take longer than the specified <I>fadeSeconds</I> if
your server isn't fast enough to keep up.  Default 20.
<DT><B>captureStderr</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
Whether <I>xscreensaver</I> should redirect its stdout and stderr streams to
the window itself.  Since its nature is to take over the screen, you would not
normally see error messages generated by xscreensaver or the sub-programs it
runs; this resource will cause the output of all relevant programs to be
drawn on the screensaver window itself, as well as being written to the
controlling terminal of the screensaver driver process.  Default true.
<DT><B>ignoreUninstalledPrograms</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
There may be programs in the list that are not installed on the system,
yet are marked as &quot;enabled.&quot;  If this preference is true, then such 
programs will simply be ignored.  If false, then a warning will be printed
if an attempt is made to run the nonexistent program.  Also, the
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

program will suppress the non-existent programs from the list if this
is true.  Default: false.
<DT><B>font</B> (class <B>Font</B>)

<DD>
The font used for the stdout/stderr text, if <B>captureStderr</B> is true.
Default <B>*-medium-r-*-140-*-m-*</B> (a 14 point fixed-width font.)
<DT><B>mode</B> (class <B>Mode</B>)

<DD>
Controls the behavior of xscreensaver.  Legal values are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>random</B>

<DD>
When blanking the screen, select a random display mode from among those
that are enabled and applicable.  This is the default.
<DT><B>one</B>

<DD>
When blanking the screen, only ever use one particular display mode (the
one indicated by the <I>selected</I> setting.)
<DT><B>blank</B>

<DD>
When blanking the screen, just go black: don't run any graphics hacks.
<DT><B>off</B>

<DD>
Don't ever blank the screen, and don't ever allow the monitor to power down.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>selected</B> (class <B>Integer</B>)

<DD>
When <I>mode</I> is set to <I>one</I>, this is the one, indicated by its
index in the <I>programs</I> list.  You're crazy if you count them and
set this number by hand: let
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

do it for you!
<DT><B>programs</B> (class <B>Programs</B>)

<DD>
The graphics hacks which <I>xscreensaver</I> runs when the user is idle.
The value of this resource is a multi-line string, one <I>sh</I>-syntax
command per line.  Each line must contain exactly one command: no
semicolons, no ampersands.
<P>
When the screensaver starts up, one of these is selected (according to
the <B>mode</B> setting), and run.  After the <I>cycle</I> period
expires, it is killed, and another is selected and run.
<P>
If a line begins with a dash (-) then that particular program is
disabled: it won't be selected at random (though you can still select
it explicitly using the
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

program.)
<P>
If all programs are disabled, then the screen will just be made blank,
as when <I>mode</I> is set to <I>blank</I>.
<P>
To disable a program, you must mark it as disabled with a dash instead
of removing it from the list.  This is because the system-wide (app-defaults)
and per-user (.xscreensaver) settings are merged together, and if a user
just <I>deletes</I> an entry from their programs list, but that entry still
exists in the system-wide list, then it will come back.  However, if the
user <I>disables</I> it, then their setting takes precedence.
<P>
If the display has multiple screens, then a different program will be run
for each screen.  (All screens are blanked and unblanked simultaniously.)
<P>
Note that you must escape the newlines; here is an example of how you
might set this in your <I>~/.xscreensaver</I> file:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>


<P>


<PRE>
programs:  \
       qix -root                          \n\
       ico -r -faces -sleep 1 -obj ico    \n\
       xdaliclock -builtin2 -root         \n\
       xv -root -rmode 5 image.gif -quit  \n

</PRE>


<P>



</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Make sure your <B>$PATH</B> environment variable is set up correctly
<I>before</I> xscreensaver is launched, or it won't be able to find the
programs listed in the <I>programs</I> resource.
<P>
To use a program as a screensaver, two things are required: that that
program draw on the root window (or be able to be configured to draw on
the root window); and that that program understand ``virtual root''
windows, as used by virtual window managers such as
<B><A HREF="../man1/tvtwm.1.php">tvtwm</A></B>(1).

(Generally, this is accomplished by just including the <I>&quot;vroot.h&quot;</I> 
header file in the program's source.)
<P>
If there are some programs that you want to run only when using a color
display, and others that you want to run only when using a monochrome
display, you can specify that like this:


<P>


<PRE>
       mono:   mono-program  -root        \n\
       color:  color-program -root        \n\

</PRE>


<P>



</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
More generally, you can specify the kind of visual that should be used for
the window on which the program will be drawing.  For example, if one 
program works best if it has a colormap, but another works best if it has
a 24-bit visual, both can be accommodated:


<P>


<PRE>
       PseudoColor: cmap-program  -root   \n\
       TrueColor:   24bit-program -root   \n\

</PRE>


<P>



</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
In addition to the symbolic visual names described above (in the discussion
of the <I>visualID</I> resource) one other visual name is supported in
the <I>programs</I> list:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>default-n</B>

<DD>
This is like <B>default</B>, but also requests the use of the default colormap,
instead of a private colormap.  (That is, it behaves as if 
the <I>-no-install</I> command-line option was specified, but only for
this particular hack.)  This is provided because some third-party programs
that draw on the root window (notably: 
<B><A HREF="../man1/xv.1.php">xv</A></B>(1),

and
<B><A HREF="../man1/xearth.1.php">xearth</A></B>(1))

make assumptions about the visual and colormap of the root window: 
assumptions which xscreensaver can violate.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>

If you specify a particular visual for a program, and that visual does not
exist on the screen, then that program will not be chosen to run.  This
means that on displays with multiple screens of different depths, you can
arrange for appropriate hacks to be run on each.  For example, if one screen
is color and the other is monochrome, hacks that look good in mono can be 
run on one, and hacks that only look good in color will show up on the other.
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<P>

You shouldn't ever need to change the following resources:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>pointerPollTime</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
When server extensions are not in use, this controls how 
frequently <I>xscreensaver</I> checks to see if the mouse position or buttons
have changed.  Default 5 seconds.
<DT><B>windowCreationTimeout</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
When server extensions are not in use, this controls the delay between when 
windows are created and when <I>xscreensaver</I> selects events on them.
Default 30 seconds.
<DT><B>initialDelay</B> (class <B>Time</B>)

<DD>
When server extensions are not in use, <I>xscreensaver</I> will wait this many
seconds before selecting events on existing windows, under the assumption that 
<I>xscreensaver</I> is started during your login procedure, and the window 
state may be in flux.  Default 0.  (This used to default to 30, but that was
back in the days when slow machines and X terminals were more common...)

</DL>
<P>

There are a number of different X server extensions which can make
xscreensaver's job easier.  The next few resources specify whether these
extensions should be utilized if they are available.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>sgiSaverExtension</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
This resource controls whether the SGI <B>SCREEN_SAVER</B> server extension
will be used to decide whether the user is idle.  This is the default 
if <I>xscreensaver</I> has been compiled with support for this 
extension (which is the default on SGI systems.).  If it is available, 
the <B>SCREEN_SAVER</B> method is faster and more reliable than what will
be done otherwise, so use it if you can.  (This extension is only available
on Silicon Graphics systems, unfortunately.)
<DT><B>mitSaverExtension</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
This resource controls whether the <B>MIT-SCREEN-SAVER</B> server extension
will be used to decide whether the user is idle.  However, the default for
this resource is <I>false</I>, because even if this extension is available,
it is flaky (and it also makes the <B>fade</B> option not work properly.)
Use of this extension is not recommended.
<DT><B>xidleExtension</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
This resource controls whether the <B>XIDLE</B> server extension will be
used to decide whether the user is idle.  This is the default 
if <I>xscreensaver</I> has been compiled with support for this extension.
(This extension is only available for X11R4 and X11R5 systems, unfortunately.)
<DT><B>procInterrupts</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
This resource controls whether the <B>/proc/interrupts</B> file should be
consulted to decide whether the user is idle.  This is the default
if <I>xscreensaver</I> has been compiled on a system which supports this
mechanism (i.e., Linux systems.)  
<P>
The benefit to doing this is that <I>xscreensaver</I> can note that the user
is active even when the X console is not the active one: if the user is 
typing in another virtual console, xscreensaver will notice that and will
fail to activate.  For example, if you're playing Quake in VGA-mode, 
xscreensaver won't wake up in the middle of your game and start competing 
for CPU.
<P>
The drawback to doing this is that perhaps you <I>really do</I> want idleness
on the X console to cause the X display to lock, even if there is activity
on other virtual consoles.  If you want that, then set this option to False.
(Or just lock the X console manually.)
<P>
The default value for this resource is True, on systems where it works.
<DT><B>overlayStderr</B> (class <B>Boolean</B>)

<DD>
If <B>captureStderr</B> is True, and your server supports ``overlay'' visuals,

the same layer as the running screenhack.  Set this to False to disable 
that (though you shouldn't need to.)
<DT><B>overlayTextForeground</B> (class <B>Foreground</B>)

<DD>
The foreground color used for the stdout/stderr text, if <B>captureStderr</B>

<H2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</H2>

<I>xscreensaver</I>

also accepts a few command-line options, mostly for use when debugging:
for normal operation, you should configure things via the <I>~/.xscreensaver</I>
file.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-display </B><I>host:display.screen</I>

<DD>
The X display to use.  For displays with multiple screens, XScreenSaver
will manage all screens on the display simultaniously.

<DD>
Same as setting the <I>verbose</I> resource to <I>true</I>: print diagnostics
on stderr and on the xscreensaver window.
<DT><B>-no-capture-stderr</B>

<DD>
Same as setting the <I>captureStderr</I> resource to <I>false</I>: do not
redirect the stdout and stderr streams to the xscreensaver window itself.
If xscreensaver is crashing, you might need to do this in order to see
the error message.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HOW IT WORKS</H2>

When it is time to activate the screensaver, a full-screen black window is
created on each screen of the display.  Each window is created in such a way
that, to any subsequently-created programs, it will appear to be a ``virtual
root'' window.  Because of this, any program which draws on the root 
window (and which understands virtual roots) can be used as a screensaver.
<P>
When the user becomes active again, the screensaver windows are unmapped, and
the running subprocesses are killed by sending them <B>SIGTERM</B>.  This is 
also how the subprocesses are killed when the screensaver decides that it's
time to run a different demo: the old one is killed and a new one is launched.
<P>
Before launching a subprocess, <I>xscreensaver</I> stores an appropriate value
for <B>$DISPLAY</B> in the environment that the child will receive.  (This is
so that if you start <I>xscreensaver</I> with a <I>-display</I> argument, the
programs which <I>xscreensaver</I> launches will draw on the same display;
and so that the child will end up drawing on the appropriate screen of a
multi-headed display.)
<P>
When the screensaver turns off, or is killed, care is taken to restore 
the ``real'' virtual root window if there is one.  Because of this, it is
important that you not kill the screensaver process with <I>kill -9</I> if
you are running a virtual-root window manager.  If you kill it with -9,
you may need to restart your window manager to repair the damage.  This
isn't an issue if you aren't running a virtual-root window manager.
<P>
For all the gory details, see the commentary at the top of xscreensaver.c.
<P>
You can control a running screensaver process by using the
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-command.1.php">xscreensaver-command</A></B>(1)

program (which see.)
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>POWER MANAGEMENT</H2>

Modern X servers contain support to power down the monitor after an idle
period.  If the monitor has powered down, then <I>xscreensaver</I> will
notice this (after a few minutes), and will not waste CPU by drawing 
graphics demos on a black screen.  An attempt will also be made to
explicitly power the monitor back up as soon as user activity is detected.
<P>
As of version 3.28 (Feb 2001), the <I>~/.xscreensaver</I> file controls the
configuration of your display's power management settings: if you have
used
<B><A HREF="../man1/xset.1.php">xset</A></B>(1)

to change your power management settings, then xscreensaver will
override those changes with the values specified 
in <I>~/.xscreensaver</I> (or with its built-in defaults, if there
is no <I>~/.xscreensaver</I> file yet.)
<P>
To change your power management settings, run
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

and change the various timeouts through the user interface.
Alternately, you can edit the <I>~/.xscreensaver</I> file directly.
<P>
If the power management section is grayed out in the
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-demo.1.php">xscreensaver-demo</A></B>(1)

window,  then that means that your X server does not support
the XDPMS extension, and so control over the monitor's power state
is not available.
<P>
If you're using a laptop, don't be surprised if changing the DPMS
settings has no effect: many laptops have monitor power-saving behavior
built in at a very low level that is invisible to Unix and X.  On such
systems, you can typically adjust the power-saving delays only by
changing settings in the BIOS in some hardware-specific way.
<P>
If DPMS seems not to be working with XFree86, make sure the &quot;DPMS&quot;
option is set in your <I>/etc/X11/XF86Config</I> file.  See the
<B><A HREF="../man5/XF86Config.5.php">XF86Config</A></B>(5)

manual for details.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USING <A HREF="../man1/XDM.1.php">XDM</A>(1)</H2>

You can run <I>xscreensaver</I> from your 
<B><A HREF="../man1/xdm.1.php">xdm</A></B>(1)

session, so that the screensaver will run even when nobody is logged 
in on the console.
<P>
The trick to using xscreensaver with <I>xdm</I> is this: keep in mind the 
two very different states in which xscreensaver will be running:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1: Nobody logged in.</B>

<DD>
<P>
If you're thinking of running xscreensaver from XDM at all, then it's 
probably because you want graphics demos to be running on the console
when nobody is logged in there.  In this case, xscreensaver will function
only as a screen saver, not a screen locker: it doesn't make sense
for xscreensaver to lock the screen, since nobody is logged in yet!
The only thing on the screen is the XDM login prompt.
<DT><B>2: Somebody logged in.</B>

<DD>
<P>
Once someone has logged in through the XDM login window, the situation is
very different.  For example: now it makes sense to lock the screen (and
prompt for the logged in user's password); and now xscreensaver should
consult that user's <I>~/.xscreensaver</I> file; and so on.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
The difference between these two states comes down to a question of,
which user is the <I>xscreensaver</I> process running as?  For the first
state, it doesn't matter.  If you start <I>xscreensaver</I> in the usual
XDM way, then xscreensaver will probably end up running as root, which 
is fine for the first case (the ``nobody logged in'' case.)
<P>
However, once someone is logged in, running as root is no longer fine:
because xscreensaver will be consulting root's <I>.xscreensaver</I> file
instead of that of the logged in user, and won't be prompting for the
logged in user's password, and so on.  (This is not a security problem,
it's just not what you want.)
<P>
So, once someone has logged in, you want xscreensaver to be running as that
user.  The way to accomplish this is to kill the old xscreensaver process
and start a new one (as the new user.)
<P>
The simplest way to accomplish all of this is as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1: Launch xscreensaver before anyone logs in.</B>

<DD>
<P>
To the file <I>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup</I>, add the lines


<P>


<PRE>
xhost +localhost
xscreensaver-command -exit
xscreensaver &amp;

</PRE>


<P>



This will run xscreensaver as root, over the XDM login window.
Moving the mouse will cause the screen to un-blank, and allow the user
to type their password at XDM to log in.
<DT><B>2: Restart xscreensaver when someone logs in.</B>

<DD>
<P>
Near the top of the file <I>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession</I>, add those same lines:


<P>


<PRE>
xscreensaver-command -exit
xscreensaver &amp;

</PRE>


<P>



When someone logs in, this will kill off the existing (root) xscreensaver
process, and start a new one, running as the user who has just logged in.
If the user's .xscreensaver file requests locking, they'll get it.  They
will also get their own choice of timeouts, and graphics demos, and so on.
<P>
Alternately, each user could just put those lines in their 
personal <I>~/.xsession</I> files.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
Make sure you have <B>$PATH</B> set up correctly in the <I>Xsetup</I> 
and <I>Xsession</I> scripts, or <I>xdm</I> won't be able to 
find <I>xscreensaver</I>, and/or <I>xscreensaver</I> won't be able to 
find its graphics demos.
<P>
(If your system does not seem to be executing the <I>Xsetup</I> file, you
may need to configure it to do so: the traditional way to do this is
to make that file the value of the <I>DisplayManager*setup</I> resource
in the <I>/usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config</I> file.  See the man page for
<B><A HREF="../man1/xdm.1.php">xdm</A></B>(1)

for more details.)
<P>
It is safe to run <I>xscreensaver</I> as root (as <I>xdm</I> is likely to do.)  
If run as root, <I>xscreensaver</I> changes its effective user and group ids 
to something safe (like <I>&quot;nobody&quot;</I>) before connecting to the X server
or launching user-specified programs.
<P>
An unfortunate side effect of this (important) security precaution is that
it may conflict with cookie-based authentication.
<P>
If you get &quot;connection refused&quot; errors when running <I>xscreensaver</I>
from <I>xdm</I>, then this probably means that you have
<B><A HREF="../man1/xauth.1.php">xauth</A></B>(1)

or some other security mechanism turned on.  One way around this is to
add <B>&quot;xhost&nbsp;+localhost&quot;</B> to <I>Xsetup</I>, just before <I>xscreensaver</I>
is launched.  
<P>
Note that this will give access to the X server to anyone capable of logging
in to the local machine, so in some environments, this might not be 
appropriate.  If turning off file-system-based access control is not
acceptable, then running <I>xscreensaver</I> from the <I>Xsetup</I> file
might not be possible, and xscreensaver will only work when running as
a normal, unprivileged user.
<P>
For more information on the X server's access control mechanisms, see the
man pages for
<B><A HREF="../man1/X.1.php">X</A></B>(1),

<B><A HREF="../man1/Xsecurity.1.php">Xsecurity</A></B>(1),

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USING <A HREF="../man1/GDM.1.php">GDM</A>(1)</H2>

Using xscreensaver with
<B><A HREF="../man1/gdm.1.php">gdm</A></B>(1)

is easy, because gdm has a configuration tool.  Just fire up
<B><A HREF="../man1/gdmconfig.1.php">gdmconfig</A></B>(1)

and on the <I>Background</I> page, type <B>&quot;xscreensaver -nosplash&quot;</B> into
the <I>Background Program</I> field.  That will cause gdm to run xscreensaver
while nobody is logged in, and kill it as soon as someone does log in.
(The user will then be responsible for starting xscreensaver on their
own, if they want.)
<P>
Another way to accomplish the same thing is to edit the
file <I>/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</I> to include:


<P>


<PRE>
BackgroundProgram=xscreensaver -nosplash
RunBackgroundProgramAlways=true

</PRE>


<P>



In this situation, the <I>xscreensaver</I> process will probably be running
as user <I>gdm</I> instead of <I>root</I>.  You can configure the settings
for this nobody-logged-in state (timeouts, DPMS, etc.) by editing
the <I>~gdm/.xscreensaver</I> file.

in any number of ways.  I've never actually seen it, but I'm told that
this is the way you disable it:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1: Switch off KDE's screen saver.</B><DD>
Open the ``<I>Control Center</I>'' and

<DT><B>3: Make xscreensaver be an Autostart program.</B><DD>
Create a file in your autostart directory

<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USING CDE (COMMON DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT)</H2>

The easiest way to use <I>xscreensaver</I> on a system with CDE is to simply
switch off the built-in CDE screensaver, and use <I>xscreensaver</I> instead;
and second, to tell the front panel to run 
<B><A HREF="../man1/xscreensaver-command.1.php">xscreensaver-command</A></B>(1)

with the <I>-lock</I> option when the <I>Lock</I> icon is clicked.
<P>
To accomplish this involves five steps:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1: Switch off CDE's locker</B><DD>
Do this by turning off ``<I>Screen Saver and Screen Lock</I>'' in the
Screen section of the Style Manager.

Edit the file <I>~/.dt/sessions/sessionetc</I> and add to it the line


<P>


<PRE>

<P>



And make sure the sessionetc file is executable.
This will cause <I>xscreensaver</I> to be launched when you log in.
(As always, make sure that xscreensaver and the graphics demos are on
your <B>$PATH</B>; the path needs to be set in <I>.cshrc</I> 
and/or <I>.dtprofile</I>, not <I>.login</I>.)
<DT><B>3: Create XScreenSaver.dt</B><DD>
Create a file called <I>~/.dt/types/XScreenSaver.dt</I> with the following

<P>



This defines a ``lock'' command for the CDE front panel, that knows how
to talk to <I>xscreensaver</I>.
<DT><B>4: Create Lock.fp</B><DD>

<DT><B>Locking and XDM</B>

<DD>
If xscreensaver has been launched from 
<B><A HREF="../man1/xdm.1.php">xdm</A></B>(1)

before anyone has logged in, you will need to kill and then restart the
xscreensaver daemon after you have logged in, or you will be confused by
the results.  (For example, locking won't work, and your <I>~/.xscreensaver</I>
file will be ignored.)
<P>
When you are logged in, you want the <I>xscreensaver</I> daemon to be 
running under <I>your</I> user id, not as root or some other user.
<P>
If it has already been started by <I>xdm</I>, you can kill it by sending

xscreensaver &amp;

</PRE>


<P>



The ``<I>Using <A HREF="../man1/XDM.1.php">XDM</A>(1)</I>'' section, above, goes into more detail, and explains
how to configure the system to do this for all users automatically.
<DT><B>Locking and root logins</B>

<DD>
In order for it to be safe for xscreensaver to be launched by <I>xdm</I>,
certain precautions had to be taken, among them that xscreensaver never
runs as <I>root</I>.  In particular, if it is launched as root (as <I>xdm</I>
is likely to do), xscreensaver will disavow its privileges, and switch 
itself to a safe user id (such as <I>nobody</I>.)
<P>
An implication of this is that if you log in as <I>root</I> on the console, 
xscreensaver will refuse to lock the screen (because it can't tell
the difference between <I>root</I> being logged in on the console, and a
normal user being logged in on the console but xscreensaver having been 
launched by the
<B><A HREF="../man1/xdm.1.php">xdm</A></B>(1)

<I>Xsetup</I>

file.)
<P>
The solution to this is simple: you shouldn't be logging in on the console
as <I>root</I> in the first place!  (What, are you crazy or something?)  
<P>
Proper Unix hygiene dictates that you should log in as yourself, and
<B><A HREF="../man1/su.1.php">su</A></B>(1)

to <I>root</I> as necessary.  People who spend their day logged in
as <I>root</I> are just begging for disaster.
<DT><B>XAUTH and XDM</B>

<DD>
For xscreensaver to work when launched by
<B><A HREF="../man1/xdm.1.php">xdm</A></B>(1),

programs running on the local machine as user <I>&quot;nobody&quot;</I> must be
able to connect to the X server.  This means that if you want to run
xscreensaver on the console while nobody is logged in, you may need
to disable cookie-based access control (and allow all users who can log
in to the local machine to connect to the display.)  
<P>
You should be sure that this is an acceptable thing to do in your
environment before doing it.  See the ``<I>Using <A HREF="../man1/XDM.1.php">XDM</A>(1)</I>'' section, 
above, for more details.
<DT><B>Passwords</B>

<DD>
If you get an error message at startup like ``couldn't get password
of <I>user</I>'' then this probably means that you're on a system in which 
the
<B><A HREF="../man3/getpwent.3.php">getpwent</A></B>(3)

library routine can only be effectively used by root.  If this is the case, 
then <I>xscreensaver</I> must be installed as setuid to root in order for
locking to work.  Care has been taken to make this a safe thing to do.  
<P>
It also may mean that your system uses shadow passwords instead of the standard
<B><A HREF="../man3/getpwent.3.php">getpwent</A></B>(3)

interface; in that case, you may need to change some options 
with <I>configure</I> and recompile.
<P>
If you change your password after xscreensaver has been launched, it will
continue using your old password to unlock the screen until xscreensaver
is restarted.  On some systems, it may accept <I>both</I> your old and new
passwords.  So, after you change your password, you'll have to do


<P>


<PRE>
xscreensaver-command -restart

</PRE>


<P>



to make <I>xscreensaver</I> notice.
<DT><B>PAM Passwords</B>

<DD>
If your system uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), then in order
for xscreensaver to use PAM properly, PAM must be told about xscreensaver.
The xscreensaver installation process should update the PAM data (on Linux,
by creating the file <I>/etc/pam.d/xscreensaver</I> for you, and on Solaris, 
by telling you what lines to add to the <I>/etc/pam.conf</I> file.)  
<P>
If the PAM configuration files do not know about xscreensaver, then 
you <I>might</I> be in a situation where xscreensaver will refuse to ever
unlock the screen.
<P>
This is a design flaw in PAM (there is no way for a client to tell the
difference between PAM responding ``I have never heard of your module,''
and responding, ``you typed the wrong password.'')  As far as I can tell,
there is no way for xscreensaver to automatically work around this, or
detect the problem in advance, so if you have PAM, make sure it is
configured correctly!
<DT><B>Colormap lossage: TWM</B>

<DD>
The <B>installColormap</B> option doesn't work very well with the
<B><A HREF="../man1/twm.1.php">twm</A></B>(1)

window manager and its descendants, on 8-bit screens.
<P>
There is a race condition between the screensaver and this window manager,
which can result in the screensaver's colormap not getting installed
properly, meaning the graphics hacks will appear in essentially random
colors.  (If the screen goes white instead of black, this is probably why.)
<P>
The
<B><A HREF="../man1/mwm.1.php">mwm</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="../man1/olwm.1.php">olwm</A></B>(1)

window managers don't have this problem.  The race condition exists
because X (really, ICCCM) does not provide a way for an OverrideRedirect 
window to have its own colormap, short of grabbing the server (which is 
neither a good idea, nor really possible with the current design.)  What 
happens is that, as soon as xscreensaver installs its colormap, <B>twm</B> 
responds to the resultant <B>ColormapNotify</B> event by re-instaling the 
default colormap.  Apparently, <B>twm</B> doesn't <I>always</I> do this; it 
seems to do it regularly if the screensaver is activated from a menu item, 
but seems to not do it if the screensaver comes on of its own volition, or 
is activated from another console.

<B><A HREF="../man3/XInstallColormap.3.php">XInstallColormap</A></B>(3)

in response to user events.  That is, it is appropriate to install a colormap
in response to <B>FocusIn</B>, <B>FocusOut</B>, <B>EnterNotify</B>, 
and <B>LeaveNotify</B> events; but it is not appropriate to call it in
response to <B>ColormapNotify</B> events.  If you install colormaps in
response to <I>application</I> actions as well as in response to <I>user</I>
actions, then you create the situation where it is impossible for 
override-redirect applications (such as xscreensaver) to display their
windows in the proper colors.

<DT><B>Colormap lossage: XV, XAnim, XEarth</B>

<DD>
Some programs don't operate properly on visuals other than the default one,
or with colormaps other than the default one.  See the discussion of the
magic &quot;default-n&quot; visual name in the description of the <B>programs</B> 
resource in the <I>Configuration</I> section.  When programs only work with
the default colormap, you need to use a syntax like this:


<P>


<PRE>
   default-n: xv -root image-1.gif -quit  \n\
   default-n: xearth -nostars -wait 0     \n\

</PRE>


<P>



It would also work to turn off the <B>installColormap</B> option altogether,
but that would deny extra colors to those programs that <I>can</I> take
advantage of them.
<DT><B>Machine Load</B>

<DD>
Although this program ``nices'' the subprocesses that it starts, 
graphics-intensive subprograms can still overload the machine by causing
the X server process itself (which is not ``niced'') to consume many
cycles.  Care has been taken in all the modules shipped with xscreensaver
to sleep periodically, and not run full tilt, so as not to cause
appreciable load.
<P>
However, if you are running the OpenGL-based screen savers on a machine
that does not have a video card with 3D acceleration, they <I>will</I>
make your machine slow, despite
<B><A HREF="../man1/nice.1.php">nice</A></B>(1).

<P>
Your options are: don't use the OpenGL display modes; or, collect the
spare change hidden under the cushions of your couch, and use it to
buy a video card manufactured after 1998.  (It doesn't even need to be
<I>fast</I> 3D hardware: the problem will be fixed if there is any
3D hardware <I>at all.</I>)
<DT><B>XFree86's Magic Keystrokes</B>

<DD>
The XFree86 X server traps certain magic keystrokes before client programs ever
see them.  Two that are of note are Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, which causes 
the X server to exit; and Ctrl+Alt+F<I>n</I>, which switches virtual consoles.
The X server will respond to these keystrokes even if xscreensaver has the
screen locked.  Depending on your setup, you might consider this a problem.
<P>
Unfortunately, there is no way for xscreensaver itself to override the
interpretation of these keys.  If you want to disable Ctrl+Alt+Backspace
globally, you need to set the <I>DontZap</I> flag in 
your <I>/etc/X11/XF86Config</I> file.  To globally disable VT switching,
you can set the <I>DontVTSwitch</I> flag.  See the
<B><A HREF="../man5/XF86Config.5.php">XF86Config</A></B>(5)

manual for details.
<DT><B>MIT Extension and Fading</B>

<DD>
The <B>MIT-SCREEN-SAVER</B> extension is junk.  Don't use it.
<P>
When using the <B>MIT-SCREEN-SAVER</B> extension in conjunction with 
the <B>fade</B> option, you'll notice an unattractive flicker just before 
the fade begins.  This is because the server maps a black window just before 
it tells the <I>xscreensaver</I> process to activate.  The <I>xscreensaver</I> 
process immediately unmaps that window, but this results in a flicker.  I 
haven't figured a way  to get around this; it seems to be a fundamental
property of the (mis-) design of this server extension.
<P>
It sure would be nice if someone would implement the <B>SGI SCREEN_SAVER</B>
extension in XFree86; it's dead simple, and works far better than the
overengineered and broken <B>MIT-SCREEN-SAVER</B> extension.
<DT><B>Keyboard LEDs</B>

<DD>
If <I>procInterrupts</I> is on (which is the default on Linux systems) and
you're using some program that toggles the state of your keyboard LEDs,
xscreensaver won't work right: turning those LEDs on or off causes a 
keyboard interrupt, which xscreensaver will interpret as user activity.
So if you're using such a program, set the <I>procInterrupts</I> resource
to False.
<DT><B>Extensions</B>

<DD>
If you are not making use of one of the server extensions (<B>XIDLE</B>,
<B>SGI SCREEN_SAVER</B>, or <B>MIT-SCREEN-SAVER</B>), then it is possible, in 
rare situations, for <I>xscreensaver</I> to interfere with event propagation 
and make another X program malfunction.  For this to occur, that other
application would need to <I>not</I> select <B>KeyPress</B> events on its 
non-leaf windows within the first 30 seconds of their existence, but then 
select for them later.  In this case, that client <I>might</I> fail to receive 
those events.  This isn't very likely, since programs generally select a
constant set of events immediately after creating their windows and then 
don't change them, but this is the reason that it's a good idea to install 
and use one of the server extensions instead, to work around this shortcoming
in the X protocol.
<P>
In all these years, I've not heard of even a single case of this happening,
but it is theoretically possible, so I'm mentioning it for completeness...
