<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

Arguments can be in any order.  
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>options</I>

<DD>
Command-line options, as specified in this
document.
To see a typical use of
<B>javadoc</B>

options, see Real World Example.
<DT><I>packagenames</I>

<DD>
A series of names of packages, separated by spaces,
such as
<B>java.lang java.lang.reflect java.awt</B>.

You must separately specify each package you want to document.
The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool uses
<B>-sourcepath </B>

to look for these package names.
The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool does not recursively traverse subpackages.
Wildcards such as asterisks (*) are not allowed.
See 
<B>EXAMPLES</B>,

Documenting One or More Packages.
<DT><I>sourcefilenames</I>

<DD>
A series of source file names, separated by spaces,
each of which can include paths and wildcards such as
asterisk (*). 
The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool will process every file whose name ends with
<I>.java ,</I>

and whose name, when stripped of that suffix, is actually a
legal class name (see Identifiers). 
Therefore, you can name files with dashes (such as X-Buffer),
or other illegal characters, to prevent them from being documented.
This is useful for test files and files generated from templates.
The path that
precedes the source file name determines where
<B>javadoc</B>

will look for the file.
The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool does not use
<B>-sourcepath </B>

to look for these source file names.)
For example, passing in
<B>Button.java </B>

is identical to
<B>./Button.java</B>.

An example source file name with a
full path is 
<B>/home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java</B>.

See
<B>EXAMPLES</B>,

Documenting One or More Classes.
You can
also mix 
<I>packagenames </I>

and
<I>sourcefilenames</I>,

as in
<B>EXAMPLES</B>,

Documenting Both Packages and Classes.
<DT><I>-subpackages pkg1:pkg2:...</I>

<DD>
Generates documentation from source files in the specified
packages and recursively in their subpackages. An alternative
to supplying packagenames or sourcefilenames.
<DT><I>@argfiles</I>

<DD>
One or more files that contain a list of Javadoc options,
<I>packagenames</I>

and
<I>sourcefilenames </I>

in any order. Wildcards (*) and
<B>-J</B>

options are not allowed in these files.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool parses the declarations and documentation comments in a
set of Java source files and produces a corresponding set of HTML
pages describing (by default) the public and protected classes,
nested classes (but not anonymous inner classes),
interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.
<P>

You can run the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool on entire packages, individual source files, or both.
In the first case, you pass in as an argument to
<B>javadoc </B>

a series of package names.
In the second case, you pass in a series
of source (<B>.java</B>) file names.
See
<B>EXAMPLES</B>

at the end of this document.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>NOTE -</B>

When you pass in package names to the Javadoc tool, it currently processes all
<B>.java</B>

classes in the specified package directories, even if the 
<B>.java</B>

files are code examples or other classes that are not
actually members of the specified packages. It does not parse each
<B>.java</B>

file for a package declaration; we may add this parsing in 
a future release.
</DL>

<P>

During a run, the Javadoc tool automatically adds cross-reference links to
package, class and member names that are being documented as part
of that run. Links appear in several places:
<P>

Summary tables listing packages, classes and members
<DT>*<DD>

<DT>*<DD>
The index
</DL>
<P>

You can add hyperlinks to existing text for classes not included on the
command line (but generated separately) by way of the -link 
and -linkoffline options.
<P>

The Javadoc tool produces one complete document each time it is run; it
cannot do incremental builds - that is, it cannot modify or
<B>directly</B>

incorporate results from previous runs of Javadoc. However, it can
link to results from other runs, as just mentioned.
<P>

As implemented, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool requires and relies on the java compiler
to do its job. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool calls part of
<B>javac </B>

to compile the
declarations, ignoring the member implementation.
It builds a rich
internal representation of the classes, including the class
hierarchy, and &quot;use&quot; relationships, then generates the HTML from
that. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool also picks up user-supplied documentation from
documentation comments in the source code.
<P>

In fact, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will run on 
<B>.java </B>

source files that are pure stub
files with no method bodies.
This means you can write
documentation comments and run the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool in the earliest stages of
design while creating the API, before writing the implementation.
<P>

Relying on the compiler ensures that the HTML output
corresponds
exactly with the actual implementation, which may rely on
implicit, rather than explicit, source code.
For example, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool will document default constructors (section 8.6.7 of Java Language
Specification) that are present in the
<B>.class </B>

files but not in the
source code.
<P>

In many cases, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool allows you to generate documentation from source files whose
code is incomplete or erroneous. This is a benefit that enables you
to generate documentation before all debugging and troubleshooting 
is done. For example, according to the Java Language Specification,
a class that contains an abstract method should itself be
declared abstract. The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool does not check for this, and would proceed without a warning,
whereas the
<B>javac</B>

compiler stops on this error. The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool does do some primitive checking of doc comments. Use the
DocCheck doclet to check the doc comments more thoroughly.
<P>

When the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool builds its internal structure for the
documentation,
it loads all referenced classes.
Because of this, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool must be
able to find all referenced classes, whether bootstrap classes,
extensions, or user classes.
For more about this, see How
Classes Are Found.
Generally speaking, classes you create must either
be loaded as an extension or in
the 
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool's class path.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>javadoc Doclets</H3>

You can customize the content and format of 
the 
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool's output 
by using doclets. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool has a default &quot;built-in&quot; doclet, called
the standard doclet, that generates HTML-formatted API documentation.
You can modify or subclass the standard doclet, or write your
own doclet to generate HTML, XML, MIF, RTF or whatever output
format you'd like.
Information about doclets and their use is at the
following locations:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<B>Javadoc </B>

Doclets
<DT>*<DD>
The
<B>-doclet </B>

command-line option
</DL>
<P>

When a custom doclet is not specified with the
<B>-doclet </B>

command line option, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool uses the default standard doclet.
The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool has several command line options that are
available regardless of which doclet is being used.
The standard doclet
adds a supplementary set of command line options.
Both sets of
options are described below in the options section.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Terminology</H3>

A few terms have specific meanings within the context of the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>generated document<DD>
The document generated by the
<B>javadoc </B>

tool from the doc
comments in Java source code.
The default generated document
is in HTML and is created by the standard doclet.
<DT>name<DD>
A name in the Java Language, namely the name of a package,
class, interface, field, constructor, or method.
A name can be
fully-qualified, such as
<B>java.lang.String.equals(java.lang.Object)</B>,

or partially-qualified, such as
<B>equals(Object)</B>.

<DT>documented classes<DD>
The classes and interfaces for which full documentation is
generated during a
<B>javadoc </B>

run. To be documented, the source
files must be available, and either their source filenames or
package names must be passed into the
<B>javadoc </B>

command.
We also refer to these as the classes included in the
<B>javadoc</B>

run, or the included classes.
<DT>inlcuded classes<DD>
Classes and interfaces whose source filenames or package names are
passed into the
<B>javadoc</B>

command.
<DT>excluded classes<DD>
Classes and interfaces whose source filename or package names are
not passed into the 
<B>javadoc </B>

command.
<DT>referenced classes<DD>
The classes and interfaces that are explicitly referred to in
the definition (implementation)
or doc comments of the documented classes and interfaces.
Examples of references include return type,
parameter type, cast type, extended class, implemented
interface, imported classes, classes used in method bodies,
@see, {@link}, {@linkplain}, and {@inheritDoc} tags.
(Notice this definition has changed since 1.3.)
tags) do not qualify as referenced classes.
When thE
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool
is run, it should load into memory all of the referenced classes in
javadoc's bootclasspath and classpath.
(The Javadoc tool prints a
&quot;Class not found&quot; warning for referenced classes not found.)
The 
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool can derive enough information from the 
<B>.class</B>

files to determine their existence and the fully qualified
names of their members.
<DT>external referenced classes<DD>
The referenced classes whose documentation not being
generated during a
<B>javadoc </B>

run.
In other words, these classes
are not passed into the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool on the comand line.
Links for names in the generated
documentation to those classes are said to be external
references or external links.
For example, if you run the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool on only the 
<B>java.awt </B>

package, then any class in 
<B>java.lang</B>,

such as Object, is an external referenced class.
External referenced classes can be linked to using the 
<B>-link </B>

and
<B>-linkoffline</B>

options.
An important property of an external referenced class is that its
source comments are normally not available to the 
<B>Javadoc</B>

run. In this case, these comments cannot be inherited.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Source Files</H3>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will generate output originating from four different types
of &quot;source&quot; files: Java language source files for
classes (<B>.java</B>), package
comment files, overview comment files, and miscellaneous
unprocessed files.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Class Source Code Files</H3>

Each class or interface and its members can have their own documentation
comment, contained in a
<B>.java</B>

file.
For more details about these doc commments, see
<B>Documentation Comments</B>

below.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Package Comment Files</H3>

Each package can have its own documentation comment, contained in its
own &quot;source&quot; file, that the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will merge into the package
summary page that it generates.
You typically include in this
comment any documentation that applies to the entire package.
<P>

To create a package comment file, you must name it 
<B>package.html</B>

and place it in the package directory in the source tree along
with the 
<B>.java </B>

files. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will automatically look for this
filename in this location.
Notice that the filename is identical
for all packages. For explicit details,
see the example of package.html.
<P>

The content of the package comment file is one big documentation
comment, written in HTML, like all other comments, with one
exception: The documentation comment should not include the
comment separators /** and */ or leading asterisks.
When writing
the comment, you should make the first sentence a summary about
the package, and not put a title or any other text between 
<B>&lt;body&gt;</B>

and the first sentence.
You can include package tags; as with any
documentation comment, all tags except {<B>@link</B>} must appear after
the description.
If you add a 
<B>@see </B>

tag in a package comment
file, it must have a
fully qualified name.
<P>

When the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool runs, it automatically looks for this file; if found,
the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool does the following:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Copies all content between
<B>&lt;body&gt; </B>

and 
<B>&lt;/body&gt; </B>

tags for
processing.
<DT>*<DD>
Processes any package tags that are present.
<DT>*<DD>
Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the package
summary page it generates, as shown in Package Summary.
<DT>*<DD>
Copies the first sentence of the package comment to the top
of the package summary page.
It also adds the package name
and this first sentence to the list of packages on the
overview page, as shown in Overview Summary.
The end-of-sentence is determined by the same rules used for the
end of the first sentence of class and member descriptions.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Overview Comment File</H3>

Each application or set of packages that you are documenting can
have its own overview documentation comment, kept in its own
&quot;source&quot; file, that the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will merge into the overview page that
it generates.
You typically include in this comment any
documentation that applies to the entire application or set of
packages.
<P>

To create an overview comment file, you can name the file anything
you want, typically 
<B>overview.html</B>,

and place it anywhere, typically
at the top level of the source tree.
Notice that you can have multiple
overview comment files for the same set of source files, in case
you want to run
<B>javadoc </B>

multiple times on different sets of packages.
For example, if the source files for the
<B>java.applet</B>

package are contained in 
<B>/home/user/src/java/applet </B>

directory, you
could create an overview comment file at
<B>/home/user/src/overview.html</B>.

<P>

The content of the overview comment file is one big documentation
comment, written in HTML, like the package comment file described
previously.
See that description for details.
To reiterate, when
writing the comment, you should make the first sentence a summary
about the application or set of packages, and not put a title or
any other text between 
<B>&lt;body&gt; </B>

and the first sentence.
You can
include overview tags; as with any documentation comment, all tags
except {<B>@link</B>} must appear after the description.
If you add a
<B>@see </B>

tag, it must have a fully-qualified name.
<P>

When you run the 
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool,
you specify the overview comment file name with the
<B>-overview </B>

option.
The file is then processed, similar to
that of a package comment file:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Copies all content between 
<B>&lt;body&gt; </B>

and 
<B>&lt;/body&gt; </B>

tags for processing.
<DT>*<DD>
Processes any overview tags that are present.
<DT>*<DD>
Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the overview page
it generates, as shown in Overview Summary.
<DT>*<DD>
Copies the first sentence of the overview comment to the top
of the overview summary page.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Miscellaneous Unprocessed Files</H3>

You can also include in your source any miscellaneous files that
you want the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool to copy to the destination directory.
These typically include
graphic files (for example, Java source (<B>.java</B>) and
class (<B>.class</B>) files) and self-standing HTML files whose content
would overwhelm the documentation comment of a normal Java source
file.
<P>

To include unprocessed files, put them in a directory called
<B>doc-files</B>,

which can be a subdirectory of any package directory.
You can have one such subdirectory for each package.
You might include images, example code, source files, 
<B>.class </B>

files, applets, and HTML files.
For example, if you want to include the image of a button
<B>button.gif </B>

in the 
<B>java.awt.Button </B>

class documentation,
you place that file in the 
<B>/home/user/src/java/awt/doc-files/</B>

directory.
Notice the 
<B>doc-files</B>

directory should not be located at
<B>/home/user/src/java/doc-files</B>

because 
<B>java</B>

is not a package - that is, it does not
directly contain any source files.
<P>

All links to these unprocessed files must be
hard-coded, because the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool does not look at the files - it
simply copies the directory and all its contents to the
destination.
For example, the link in the 
<B>Button.java </B>

doc comment might look like:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
/**
* This button looks like this:
* &lt;img src=&quot;doc-files/Button.gif&quot;&gt;
*/
</PRE>


<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Generated Files</H3>

By default,
<B>javadoc </B>

uses a standard doclet that generates
HTML-formatted documentation.
This doclet generates the following
kinds of files (where each HTML &quot;page&quot; corresponds to a separate
file).
Note that
<B>javadoc </B>

generates files with two types of names:
those named after classes/interfaces, and those that are not (such
as <B>package-summary.html</B>).
Files in the latter group contain
hyphens to prevent file name conflicts
with those in the former group.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Basic Content Pages</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
One class or interface page (<B>classname.html</B>) for each class
or interface it is documenting.
<DT>*<DD>
One package page (<B>package-summary.html</B>) for each package it
is documenting. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool includes any HTML text provided
in a file named 
<B>package.html </B>

in the package directory of the
source tree.
<DT>*<DD>
One overview page (<B>overview-summary.html</B>) for the entire set
of packages.
This is the front page of the generated document.
The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool includes any HTML text provided in a
file specified with the
<B>-overview </B>

option.
Note that
this file is created only if you pass into
<B>javadoc </B>

two or more package
names.
For further explanation, see
<B>HTML Frames</B>

below.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Cross-Reference Pages</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
One class hierarchy page for the entire set of packages
(<B>overview-tree.html</B>).
To view this, click on &quot;Overview&quot; in
the navigation bar, then click on &quot;Tree&quot;.
<DT>*<DD>
One class hierarchy page for each package (<B>package-tree.html</B>).
To view this, go to a particular package, class or interface
page; click &quot;Tree&quot; to display the hierarchy for that package.
<DT>*<DD>
One &quot;use&quot; page for each package (<B>package-use.html</B>) and a
separate one for each class and interface
(<B>class-use/classname.html</B>). This page describes what
packages, classes, methods, constructors, and fields use any
part of the given class, interface, or package.
Given a class
or interface A, its &quot;use&quot; page includes subclasses of A,
fields declared as A, methods that return A, and methods and
constructors with parameters of type A.
You can access this
page by first going to the package, class, or interface, then
clicking on the &quot;Use&quot; link in the navigation bar.
<DT>*<DD>
A deprecated API page (<B>deprecated-list.html</B>) listing all
deprecated names.
(A deprecated name is not recommended for
use, generally due to improvements, and a replacement name is
usually given.
Deprecated APIs may be removed in future implementations.)
<DT>*<DD>
A constant field values page (<B>constant-values.html</B>) for
the values of static fields.
<DT>*<DD>
A serialized form page (<B>serialized-form.html</B>) for information
about serializable and externalizable classes.
Each such
class has a description of its serialization fields and
methods.
This information is of interest to re-implementors,
not to developers using the API.
While there is no link in
the navigation bar, you can get to this information by going
to any serialized class and clicking &quot;Serialized Form&quot; in the
&quot;See also&quot; section of the class description.
The standard doclet automatically generates a serialized form
page: any class (public or non-public) that implements
Serializable is included, along with 
<B>readObject</B>

and
<B>writeObject</B>

methods, the fields that are serialized, and the doc
comments from the @serial, @serialField, and @serialData
tags. Public serializable classes can be excluded by marking them
(or their package) with @serial exclude, and package-private
serializable classes can be included by marking them
(or their package) with @serial include. As of 1.4, you can 
generate the complete serialized form for public and private
classes by running javadoc without specifying the
-private option.
<DT>*<DD>
An index (<B>index-*.html</B>) of all class, interface, constructor,
field and method names, alphabetically arranged.
This is internationalized for Unicode and can be generated as a
single file or as a separate file for each starting character
(such as A-Z for English).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Support Files</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
A help page (<B>help-doc.html</B>) that describes the navigation bar
and the above pages.
You can provide your own custom help
file to override the default using
<B>-helpfile</B>.

<DT>*<DD>
One 
<B>index.html </B>

file that creates the HTML frames for display.
This is the file you load to display the front page
with frames.
This file itself contains no text content.
<DT>*<DD>
Several frame files (<B>*-frame.html</B>) containing lists of
packages, classes and interfaces, used when HTML frames are
being displayed.
<DT>*<DD>
A package list file (<B>package-list</B>), used by the
<B>-link </B>

and
<B>-linkoffline </B>

options.
This is a text file, not HTML, and is
not reachable through any links.
<DT>*<DD>
A style sheet file (<B>stylesheet.css</B>) that controls a limited
amount of color, font family, font size, font style, and
positioning on the generated pages.
<DT>*<DD>
A doc-files directory that holds any image, example, source
code, or other files that you want copied to the destination
directory.

<H3>HTML Frames</H3>

The 
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool
will generate either two or three HTML frames, as shown in
the figure below.
When you pass source files (*<B>.java</B>) or a single
package name as arguments into the
<B>javadoc </B>

command, it creates
only one frame (C) in the left-hand column, that is,
the list of classes.
When you pass into
<B>javadoc </B>

two or more package names, it creates a
third frame (P) listing all packages, as well as an overview page
(Detail).
This overview page has the file name,
<B>overview-summary.html</B>.

Thus, this file is created only if you pass
in two or more package names.
You can bypass frames by clicking on
the &quot;No Frames&quot; link or entering at 
<B>overview-summary.html</B>.

<P>

If you are unfamiliar with HTML frames, you should be aware that
frames can have focus for printing and scrolling.
To give a frame
focus, click on it.
Then, on many browsers the arrow keys and page
keys will scroll that frame,
and the print menu command will print it.

<H3>Generated File Structure</H3>

The generated class and interface files are organized in the same
directory hierarchy as Java source files and class files.
This structure is one directory per subpackage.
<P>

For example, the document generated for the class
<B>java.applet.Applet</B>

would be located at
<B>java/applet/Applet.html</B>.

The file structure for the
<B>java.applet</B>

package follows, given that the destination directory is named
<B>apidocs</B>.

All files that contain the word &quot;frame&quot; appear in the
upper-left or lower-left frames, as noted.
All other HTML files
appear in the right-hand frame.
<P>

NOTE: Directories are shown in bold.
The asterisks (*)
indicate the files and directories that are omitted when
the arguments to
<B>javadoc </B>

are source file names (*<B>.java</B>)
rather than package names.
Also, when arguments are
source file names,
<B>package-list </B>

is created but is empty.
The
<B>doc-files</B>

directory is not created in the
destination unless it exists in the source tree.

<H3>Generated API Declarations</H3>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool generates a declaration at the start of each class, interface, field, 
constructor, and method description. This declaration is the declaration for 
that API item. For example, the declaration for the Boolean class is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
public final class Boolean
extends Object
implements Serializable
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

and the declaration for the Boolean.valueOf method is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
public static Boolean valueOf(String s)
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool can include the modifiers
<B>public,</B>

<B>protected,</B>

<B>private,</B>

<B>abstract,</B>

<B>final,</B>

<B>static,</B>

<B>transient,</B>

and
<B>volatile,</B>

but not 
<B>synchronized</B>

or
<B>native.</B>

These last two modifiers are considered implementation detail
and not part of the API specification.
<P>

Rather than relying on the keyword
<B>synchronized,</B>

APIs should document their concurrency semantics in the
comment description, as in &quot;a single
<B>Enumeration</B>

cannot be used by multiple threads concurrently&quot;.
The document should not describe how to achieve these semantics. As
another example, while
<B>Hashtable</B>

should be thread-safe, there's no reason to specify that we achieve
this by synchronizing all of its exported methods. We should reserve the
right to synchronize internally at the bucket level, thus offering
higher concurrency.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Documentation Comments</H3>

The original &quot;Documentation Comments Specification&quot; can be found
under related documentation.
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Commenting the Source Code</H3>

You can include documentation comments (&quot;doc comments&quot;)
in the source code, ahead
of declarations for any entity (classes, interfaces, methods,
constructors, or fields).
You can also create doc comments for each package and another
one for the overview, though their syntax is slightly different.
Doc comments are also known as Javadoc comments.
A doc comment consists of the characters between the
characters
<B>/**</B>

that begin the comment and the characters
<B>*/</B>

that end it.
Leading asterisks are allowed on each line and are described
further below.
The text can continue onto multiple lines.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
/**
* This is the typical format of a simple documentation comment
* that spans two lines.
*/
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

To save space you can put a comment on one line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
/** This comment takes up only one line. */
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Placement of comments - Documentation comments are recognized only
when placed immediately before class, interface, constructor,
method, or field declarations (see the class example, method
example, and field example).
Documentation comments placed in the
body of a method are ignored.
Only one documentation comment per
declaration statement is recognized by the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool.
<P>

A common mistake is to put an import statement between the class
comment and the class declaration.
Avoid this, as
<B>javadoc</B>

will ignore the class comment.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
/**
* This is the class comment for the class Whatever.
*/

import com.sun;   // MISTAKE - Important not to put statement here

public class Whatever {
}
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

A comment is a description followed by tags -
The description
begins after the starting delimiter
<B>/**</B>

and continues until the tag section.
The tag section starts with the first character 
<B>@</B>

that begins a line (ignoring leading asterisks and white space).
It is possible to have a comment with only tags and no description.
The description cannot continue after the tag section begins.
The argument to a tag can span multiple lines.
There can be any number of tags - some types of tags can be
repeated while others cannot.
This 
<B>@see </B>

starts the tag section:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
 /**
 * This is a doc comment.
 * @see java.lang.Object
 */
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Standard and in-line tags -
A 
<B>tag</B>

is a special keyword within a doc comment that the Javadoc tool can process.
The Javadoc tool has standalone tags, which appear as
<B>@tag,</B>

and in-line tags, which appear within braces, as
<B>{@tag</B>}.

To be interpreted, a standalone tag must appear at the beginning of a line,
ignoring leading asterisks, white space and comment separator (/**).
This means you can use the @ character elsewhere in the text and it will
not be interpreted as the start of a tag. If you want to start a line with
the @ character and not have it be interpreted, use the HTML entity &amp;#064;.
Each standalone tag has associated text, which includes any text following the
tag up to, but not including, either the next tag, or the end of the doc 
comment. This associated text can span multiple lines.
An in-line tag is allowed and interpreted anywhere that text is 
allowed. The following example contains the standalone tag
<B>@deprecated</B>

and in-line tag
<B>{@link}.</B>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
/**
 * @deprecated As of JDk 1.1, replaced by {@link #setBounds(int,int,int,int)}
 */
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Comments are written in HTML -
The text must be written in HTML, in that they should 
use HTML entities and HTML tags.
You can use whichever version of HTML your browser supports;
we have written the standard doclet to generate HTML 3.2-compliant code
elsewhere (outside of the documentation comments) with the
inclusion of cascading style sheets and frames.
(We preface each generated file 
with &quot;HTML 4.0&quot; because of the frame sets.)
<P>

For example, entities for the less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;)
symbols should be written
<B>&amp;lt;</B>

and
<B>&amp;gt;</B>.

Likewise, the ampersand
(&amp;) should be written
<B>&amp;amp;</B>.

The bold HTML tag &lt;b&gt; is shown in the
following example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
/**
* This is a &lt;b&gt;doc&lt;/b&gt; comment.
* @see java.lang.Object
*/
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Leading asterisks -
When
<B>javadoc </B>

parses a doc comment, leading
asterisk (*) characters on each line are discarded; blanks and
tabs preceding the initial asterisk (*) characters are also
discarded.
If you omit the leading asterisk on a line, all
leading white space is removed.
Therefore, you should not omit leading
asterisks if you want leading white space to be kept, such as when
indenting sample code with the 
<B>&lt;pre&gt; </B>

tag.
<P>

First sentence - 
The first sentence of each doc comment should be a summary
sentence, containing a concise but complete description of the
declared entity.
This sentence ends at the first period that is
followed by a blank, tab, or line terminator, or at the first 
standalone tag. The 
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool copies this first sentence to the member summary at the
top of the HTML page.
See -breakiterator for a description of how we are planning
in a future release to change the way the sentence break is determined.
<P>

Declaration with multiple fields -
<B>Java </B>

allows declaring multiple
fields in a single statement, but this statement can have only
one documentation comment, which is copied for all fields.
Therefore, if you want individual
documentation comments for each field,
you must declare each field in a separate statement.
For example, the
following documentation comment doesn't make sense when written as a
single declaration and would be better handled as two declarations:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
/**
* The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y)
*/
public int x, y;      // Avoid this
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool generates the following documentation from the above
code:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
public int x

</B>
The horizontal and vertical distances of point
(x,y).
<B>
</B><PRE>
public int y
</PRE>


The horizontal and vertical distances of point
(x,y).
</DL>

<P>

Use header tags carefully -
When writing documentation comments
for members, it is best not to use HTML heading tags such as
<B>&lt;H1&gt;</B>

and 
<B>&lt;H2&gt;</B>,

because the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool creates an entire structured document
and these structural tags can interfere with the formatting
of the generated document.
However, it is fine to use these headings
in class and package comments to provide your own structure.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Automatic Reuse of Method Comments</H3>

The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool has the ability to automatically reuse or &quot;inherit&quot;
method comments in classes and interfaces. When a description, 
or @return, @param, @see or @throws tag is missing from a
method comment, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool instead copies the corresponding description or tag
comment from the method it overrides or implements (if any),
according to the algorithm below.
<P>

More specifically, when a @param tag for a particular parameter
is missing, then the comment for that parameter is copied.
When an @throws tag for a particular exception is missing,
the @throws tag is copied only if that exception is declared.
<P>

This behavior contrasts with version 1.3 and earlier, where
the presence of any description or tag would prevent all comments
from being inherited.
<P>

Also of interest, is the inline tag {<B>@inheritDoc</B>} is 
present in a description or any tag, the corresponding description
or tag is copied at that spot.
<P>

The overridden method must be a member of a documented class, and 
not an external referenced class for the doc comment to actually
be available to copy.
<P>

Inheriting of comments occurs in three cases:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
When a method in a class overrides a method in a superclass

<DT>*<DD>
When a method in an interface overrides a method in a
superinterface
<DT>*<DD>
When a method in a class implements a method in an interface

</DL>
<P>

In the first two cases, for method overrides, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool generates a subheading &quot;Overrides&quot; in the
documentation for the overriding method, 
with a link to the method it is overriding.
<P>

In the third case, when a method in a given class implements a
method in an interface, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool generates a subheading
&quot;Specified by&quot; in the documentation for the overriding method,
with a link to the
method it is implementing.
<P>

Algorithm for Inheriting Method Descriptions
If a method does not have a doc comment, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool searches for an applicable comment using the
following algorithm, which is designed to find the most
specific applicable doc comment, giving
preference to interfaces over superclasses:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1. <DD>
Look in each directly implemented (or extended) interface in 
the order they appear following the word implements (or extends)
in the method declaration. Use the first doc comment found for this method.
<DT>2.<DD>
If step 1 failed to find a doc comment, recursively apply this entire
algorithm to each directly implemented (or extended)
interface, in the same order they were examined in step 1.
<DT>3. If step 2 failed to find a doc comment and this is <DD>
a class other than Object (not an interface):
<P>
<PRE>
<B>a. If the superclass has a doc comment for this method, use it.
b. If step 3a failed to find a doc comment, recursively apply this
entire algorithm to the superclass.
</B></PRE>

</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>javadoc Tags</H3>

The 
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool parses special tags when they are embedded within a 
Java doc comment.
These doc tags enable you to autogenerate a complete,
well-formatted API from your source code.
The tags start with an
&quot;at&quot; sign (<B>@</B>) and are case-sensitive -
they must be typed with
the uppercase and lowercase letters as shown.
A tag must start at
the beginning of a line (after any leading spaces and an optional
asterisk) or it is treated as normal text.
By convention, tags with the same name are grouped together.
For example, put all 
<B>@see </B>

tags together.
<P>

Tags come in two types:
<P>

*
Standalone tags - Can be placed only in the tag section that
follows the desription. There tags are not set off with
curly braces: @tag.
<P>

*
Inline tags - Can be placed anywhere in the comments description
or in the comments for standalone tags. Inline tags are set off 
with curly braces:{<B>@tag</B>}.
<P>

For information about tags we might introduce in future releases,
see Proposed Tags.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>@author</B><I> name-text</I>

<DD>
Adds an &quot;Author&quot; entry with the specified name-text to the
generated docs when the
<B>-author</B>

option is used.
A doc comment may contain multiple 
<B>@author </B>

tags.
You can specify one name per 
<B>@author </B>

tag or multiple names per tag.
In the former case, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool inserts a comma (<B>,</B>) and space between names.
In the latter case, the entire text is simply copied to the
generated document without being parsed.
Therefore, use
multiple names per line if you want a localized name
separator other than a comma.
<DT><B>@deprecated</B><I> deprecated-text</I>

<DD>
Adds a comment indicating that this API should no longer be
used (even though it might continue to work).
<B>javadoc </B>

moves the
deprecated-text ahead of the description, placing it in
italics and preceding it with a bold warning: &quot;<B>Deprecated</B>&quot;.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The first sentence of deprecated-text should at least tell
the user when the API was deprecated and what to use as a
replacement.
<B>javadoc </B>

copies just the first sentence to the
summary section and index.
Subsequent sentences can also
explain why it has been deprecated.
You should include a
{<B>@link</B>} tag (for
<B>javadoc </B>

1.2 or later) that points to the
replacement API:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
For
<B>javadoc </B>

 */
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
For
<B>javadoc </B>

1.1, the standard format is to create a 
<B>@see</B>

tag (which cannot be in-line) for each 
<B>@deprecated </B>

tag.
</DL>
<P>

For more about deprecation, see the 
<B>@deprecated </B>

tag.
</DL>

<B>{@docRoot}</B>

Represents the relative path to the generated document's
(destination) root directory from any generated page.
It is useful when you want to include a file, such as a
copyright page or company logo, that you want to
reference from all generated pages.
Linking to the copyright page from the bottom of each page is common.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This
<B>{@docRoot}</B>

tag can be used both on the command line
and in a doc comment:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
On the command line, where the header/footer/bottom
are defined:
<P>
<B>javadoc -bottom '&lt;a href={@docRoot}/copyright.html&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;'</B>

</DL>
<P>

NOTE - When using {<B>@docRoot</B>} this way in a make file,
some makefile programs require special escaping for the brace {}
characters. For example, the Inprise MAKE version 5.2 running
on Windows requires double braces: {{<B>@docRoot</B>}}. It also
requires double (rather than single) quotes to enclose
arguments to options such as -bottom (with the
quotes around the href argument omitted).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>2.<DD>
In a doc comment:
<P>
<PRE>
<B>/**
* See the &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}/copyright.html&quot;&gt;Copyright&lt;/a&gt;.
*/
</B></PRE>

</DL>
<P>

The reason this tag is needed
is because the generated docs
are in hierarchical directories, as deep as the number of
subpackages.
This expression:
<P>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>&lt;a href={@docRoot}/copyright.html&gt;</B>

<P>
would resolve to:
<P>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>&lt;a href=&quot;../../copyright.html&quot;&gt;</B>   ... for java/lang/Object.java
<P>
and
<P>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<B>&lt;a href=&quot;../../../copyright.html&quot;&gt;</B> ... for java/lang/ref/Reference.java
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>@exception</B><I> class-name description</I>

<DD>
The 
<B>@exception </B>

tag is a synonym for 
<B>@throws</B>.

<DT>{<B>@inheritDoc</B>}<DD>
Inherits documetnation from the nearest superclass into
the current doc comment. This allows comments to be abstracted
up the inheritance tree, and enables developers to write around
the copied text. Also see inheriting comments.
</DL>
<P>

This tag can be places in two positions:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
In the comment body (before the first standalone tag),
where it will copy the entire comment body from its superclass.
<DT>*<DD>
In the text argument of a standalone tag, where it
will copy the text of the tag from its superclass.
<DT>{<B>@link</B> &quot; package.class#member label&quot; }<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Inserts an in-line link with visible text
<B>label</B>

that points to the documentation for the specified package, class or 
member name of a referenced class.
<P>

This tag is very similar to  
<B>@see </B>

- both require the same references and accept exactly the same syntax
for package.class#member and 
<B>label.</B>

The main difference is that {<B>@link</B>} generates an in-line link rather than
placing the link in the &quot;See Also&quot; section. Also, the {<B>@link</B>} tag
begins and ends with curly braces to separate it from the rest of the
in-line text. If you need to use &quot;}&quot; inside the label, use the HTML
entity notation 
<B>&amp;#125;</B>

<P>

There is no limit to the number of {<B>@link</B>} tags allowed in a
sentence.
You can use this tag in the description part of a
documentation comment or in the text portion of any tag (such
as 
<B>@deprecated</B>,

<B>@return</B>,

or 
<B>@param</B>).

<P>

For example, here is a comment that refers to the
<B>getComponentAt(int, int) </B>

method:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
Use the {<B>@link #getComponentAt(int, int) getComponentAt</B>} method.
</PRE>


<P>

&gt;From this, the standard doclet would generate the following
HTML (assuming it refers to another class in the same
package):
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
Use the 
&lt;a href=&quot;Component.html#getComponentAt(int, int)&quot;&gt;\
               getComponentAt&lt;/a&gt;method.
</PRE>


<P>

which appears on the web page as:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
Use the getComponentAt method.
</PRE>


<P>

You can extend {<B>@link</B>} to link to classes not being documented
by using the 
<B>-link</B>

otion. 
</DL>

<DT>{<B>@linkplain</B> &quot; package.class#member label&quot;}<DD>
Indentical to {<B>@link</B>}, except the link's label is displayed
in plain text than code font. Useful when the label is plain text.
Example:
</DL>
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
Refer to {<B>@linkplain</B> add() the overridden method}.
</PRE>


<P>

This would display as
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
Refer to the overridden method.
</PRE>


<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>@param</B><I> parameter-name description</I>

<DD>
Adds a parameter to the &quot;Parameters&quot; section.
The description
may continue on the next line.
<DT><B>@return</B><I> description</I>

<DD>
Adds a &quot;Returns&quot; section with the description text.
This text
should describe the return type and permissible range of values.
<DT><B>@see</B><I> reference</I>

<DD>
Adds a &quot;See Also&quot; heading with a link or text entry that
points to
<I>reference</I>.

A doc comment can contain any number of
<B>@see </B>

tags, which are all grouped under the same heading.
The
<B>@see </B>

tag has three variations; the third form below is the
most common.
<DT><B>@see</B><I> string</I>

<DD>
Adds a text entry for string. No link is generated.
The string is a book or other reference to information not
available by URL. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool distinguishes this from the
previous cases by looking for a double-quote (&quot;) as the
first character.
For example:
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
     @see &quot;The Java Programming Language&quot;
</PRE>


<P>

This generates text such as:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
     See Also:
          &quot;The Java Programming Language&quot;
</PRE>


</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>@see &lt;a href=&quot;</B><I>URL#value</I><B>&quot;&gt;</B><I>label</I><B>&lt;/a&gt;</B><DD>
Adds a link as defined by
<I>URL#value</I>.

The
<I>URL#value</I>

is a relative or absolute URL. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool distinguishes this
from other cases by looking for a less-than symbol (<B>&lt;</B>)
as the first character.
For example:
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
     @see &lt;a href=&quot;spec.html#section&quot;&gt;Java Spec&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>


<P>

This generates a link such as:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
    See Also:
          Java Spec
</PRE>


</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>@see</B><I> package.class#member label</I>

<DD>
Adds a link, with visible text label, that points to the
documentation for the specified name in the Java Language
that is referenced.
The label is optional; if omitted, the name
appears instead as the visible text, suitably shortened
(see How a Name Is Displayed).
Use the label when you want the
visible text to be abbreviated or different from the name.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
In version 1.2, just the name but not the label would
automatically appear in
<B>&lt;code&gt;</B>

HTML tags.
Starting with
1.2.2, the
<B>&lt;code&gt;</B>

is always included around the visible
text, whether or not a label is used.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<I>package.class#member </I>

is any valid name in the Java
Language that is referenced (package, class,
interface, constructor, method, or field name),
except that you replace the dot ahead of the member
name with a hash character (#).
If this name is in
the documented classes, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will automatically
create a link to it.
To create links to external
referenced classes, use the
<B>-link </B>

option.
Use
either of the other two 
<B>@see </B>

forms for referring to
documentation of a name that does not belong to a
referenced class.
This argument is described
at greater length below under Specifying a Name.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>label</I>

is optional text that is visible as the
link's label.
The label can contain white space.
If a label is omitted, then 
<I>package.class.member </I>

will appear, suitably shortened relative to the current
class and package (see How a Name Is Displayed).
<DT>*<DD>
A space is the delimiter between
<I>package.class#member </I>

and
<I>label</I>.

A space inside
parentheses does not indicate the start of a label,
so spaces can be used between parameters in a method.
</DL>
<P>

Example - In this example, an
<B>@see </B>

tag (in the Character
class) refers to the equals method in the String class.
The tag includes both arguments, that is, the name
&quot;<B>String#equals(Object)</B>&quot; and the label &quot;<B>equals</B>&quot;:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
      /**
      * @see String#equals(Object) equals
      */
</PRE>


<P>

The standard doclet produces HTML something like this:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
    &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;See Also:&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;../../java/lang/String#equals\
                 (java.lang.Object)&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equals&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/dl&gt;
</PRE>


<P>

The above looks something like this in a browser, where the
label is the visible link text:
<P>

<B>
</B><PRE>
     See Also:
          equals
</PRE>


<P>

<B>Specifying a Name - </B>

This 
<I>package.class#member </I>

name can
be either fully qualified, such as
<B>java.lang.String#toUpperCase()</B>,

or not, such as
<B>String#toUpperCase()</B>

or
<B>#toUpperCase()</B>.

If less than fully-qualified, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool uses the normal Java compiler
search order to find it, further described below in
Search order for 
<B>@see</B>.

The name can contain whitespace
within parentheses, such as between method arguments.
<P>

Of course the advantage to providing shorter,
&quot;partially-qualified&quot; names is that they are less
to type and less clutter in the source code.
The following
table shows the different forms of the name, where Class
can be a class or interface, Type can be a class,
interface, array, or primitive, and method can be a
method or constructor.

</TABLE></TABLE>

<P>

The following notes apply to the above table:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
The first set of forms (with no class or package)
will cause the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool to search only through the
current class's hierarchy.
It will find a member of
the current class or interface, one of its
superclasses or superinterfaces, or one of its
enclosing classes or interfaces (search steps 1-3).
It will not search the rest of the current package
or other packages (search steps 4-5).
<DT>*<DD>
If any method or constructor is entered as a name
with no parentheses, such as getValue, and if
no field with the same name exists, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will correctly create a link to it, but will print a
warning message reminding you to add the
parentheses and arguments.
If this method is overloaded, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool links to the first method
that its search encounters, which is unspecified.
<DT>*<DD>
Nested classes must be specified as
<B>outer.inner</B>,

not only
<B>inner</B>,

for all forms.
<DT>*<DD>
As stated, the hash character (<B>#</B>), rather than a
dot (<B>.</B>), separates a member from its class.
This enables the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool to resolve ambiguities, since the
dot also separates classes, nested classes,
packages, and subpackages.
However, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool is generally lenient and will properly
parse a dot if you know there is no ambiguity, though it will 
print a warning.
</DL>
<P>

<B>Search Order for @see:</B>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will process an
<B>@see </B>

tag that appears in a source file (<B>.java</B>), package file
(<B>package.html</B>), or overview file (<B>overview.html</B>).
In the latter two files, you must fully qualify the name you
supply with 
<B>@see</B>.

In a source file, you can specify a
name that is fully qualified or partially qualified.
<P>

When the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool encounters an 
<B>@see </B>

tag in a 
<B>.java </B>

file that
is not fully qualified, it searches for the specified
name in the same order as the Java compiler would
(except the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will not detect certain namespace
ambiguities, since it assumes the source code is free of
these errors).
This search order is formally defined in
Chapter 6, &quot;Names&quot; of the
<I>Java Language Specification</I>,

Second Edition. The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool searches for that name through all related and imported
classes and packages.
In particular, it searches in this order:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1. <DD>
The current class or interface

<DT>2. <DD>
Any enclosing classes and interfaces, searching
closest first
<DT>3. <DD>
Any superclasses and superinterfaces, searching
closest first
<DT>4. <DD>
The current package
<DT>5. <DD>
Any imported packages, classes and interfaces,
searching in the order of the import statement

</DL>
<P>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool continues to search recursively through steps
1-3 for each class it encounters until it finds a match.
That is, after it searches through the current class and
its enclosing class E, it searches through E's
superclasses before E's enclosing classes.
In steps 4 and 5, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool does not search classes or interfaces
within a package in any specified order (that order
depends on the particular compiler).
In step 5, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool will look in
<B>java.lang</B>,<B>since</B>that<B>is</B>automatically

imported by all programs.
<P>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool won't necessarily look in subclasses, nor will
it look in other packages even if their documentation is
being generated in the same run.
For example, if the
<B>@see </B>

tag is in 
<B>java.awt.event.KeyEvent </B>

class and refers
to a name in the 
<B>java.awt </B>

package,
<B>javadoc </B>

will not look
in that package unless that class imports it.
<P>

<B>How a Name is Displayed -</B>

If
<I>label</I>

is omitted, then
<I>package.class.member </I>

will appear.
In general, it will be
suitably shortened relative to the current class and
package.
By &quot;shortened&quot;, we mean the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will display
only the minimum name necessary.
For example, if the
String.toUpperCase() method contains references to a
member of the same class and to a member of a different
class, the class name will be displayed only in the
latter case:

option.
<DT><B>@since</B><I> since-text</I>

<DD>
Adds a &quot;Since&quot; heading with the specified
<I>since-text</I>

to the generated documentation.
The text has no special internal structure.
This tag means that this change or feature has
existed since the software release specified by the

For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<B>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

For source code in the Java platform, this tag indicated the 
version of the Java platform API specification (not necessarily
when it was added to the reference implementation).
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>@serial</B><I> field-description</I><B>|</B><I>include</I><B>|</B><I>exclude</I>

<DD>
Used in the doc comment for a default serializable field.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

An optional
<I>field-description</I>

augments the doc comment for the field.
The combined description must explain the meaning
of the field and list the acceptable values.
If needed, the
description can span multiple lines.
The standard doclet adds this information to the
serialized form page.
<P>

The 
<B>include</B>

and
<B>exclude</B>

arguments identify whether a class or package should be included or
excluded from the serialized form page. They work as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>* A public or protected class that implements <DD>
<B>Serializable</B>

is
<B>included</B>

unless the class (or its package) is marked
<B>@serial</B>

<B>exclude</B>.

<DT>* A private or package-private class that implements <DD>
<B>Serializable</B>

is
<B>excluded</B>

unless that class (or its package) is marked
<B>@serial</B>

<B>include</B>.

</DL>
<P>

Examples: The
<B>javax.swing</B>

package is marked
<B>@serial</B>

<B>exclude</B>

(in package.html). The public class
<B>java.sercurity.BasicPermission</B>

is marked
<B>@serial</B>

<B>exclude.</B>

The package-private class
<B>java.util.PropertyPermissionCollection</B>

is marked
<B>@serial</B>

<B>include.</B>

<P>

The tag
<B>@serial</B>

at a class level overrides
<B>@serial</B>

at a package level.
<P>

For more information about how to use these tags, along with
an example, see &quot;Documenting Serializable Fields and Data for
a Class,&quot; Section 1.6 of the
<I>Java Object Serialization Specification</I>.

Also see the &quot;Serialization FAQ,&quot; which covers

<P>

</DL>

<DT><B>@serialField</B><I> field-name  field-type  field-description</I>

<DD>
Documents an ObjectStreamField component of a Serializable
class's serialPersistentFields member.
One 
<B>@serialField </B>

tag
should be used for each ObjectStreamField component.
<DT><B>@serialData</B><I> data-description</I>

<DD>
The
<I>data-description</I>

documents the types and order of data in the serialized form.
Specifically, this data includes the optional data written by the writeObject
method and all data (including base classes) written by the
Externalizable.writeExternal method.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The 
<B>@serialData </B>

tag can be used in the doc comment for the
writeObject, readObject, writeExternal, and readExternal
methods.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>@throws</B><I> class-name  description</I>

<DD>
The 
<B>@throws </B>

and 
<B>@exception </B>

tags are synonyms.
Adds a &quot;Throws&quot;
subheading to the generated documentation, with the
<I>class-name</I>

and
<I>description</I>

text.
The
<I>class-name</I>

is the name
of the exception that may be thrown by the method.
If this
class is not fully specified, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool uses the search order
to look up this class.
A
<B>@throws</B>

tag's comment documented in a superclass or interface
is inherited in two cases: (1) for a corresponding
exception declared in a throws clause of the subclass 
and (2) for all runtime exceptions. If neither is 
the case and you want to force the documentation to be
inherited, then use {<B>@inheritDoc</B>}.
<DT><B>{@value</B>}

<H3>Overview Documentation Tags</H3>

Overview tags are tags that can appear in the documentation
comment for the overview page, which resides in the source file
typically named (<B>overview.html</B>).
Like any other documentation
comments, these tags must appear after the description.
<P>

NOTE: The {<B>@link</B>} tag has a bug in overview documents in version 1.2.
Text appears properly but has no link. The {<I>@docRoot</I>} tag
foes not currently work in overview documents.

<H3>Javadoc Options</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-overview</B><I> path/filename</I>

<DD>
Specifies that
<B>javadoc </B>

should retrieve the text for the
overview documentation from the &quot;source&quot; file specified by
<I>path/filename</I>

and place it on the Overview page
(<B>overview-summary.html</B>).
The
<I>path/filename</I>

is relative to the
<B>-sourcepath</B>.

</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
While you can use any name you want for
<I>filename</I>

and place it
anywhere you want for
<I>path</I>,

a typical thing to do is to name it 
<B>overview.html </B>

and place it in the source tree at the
directory that contains the topmost package directories.
In this location, no path is needed when documenting packages,
since
<B>-sourcepath </B>

will point to this file.
For example, if
the source tree for the
<B>java.lang</B>

package is
<B>/src/classes/java/lang/</B>,

then you could place the overview
file at 
<B>/src/classes/overview.html</B>.

See Real World Example.
<P>

For information about the file specified by
<I>path/filename</I>,

see overview comment file.
<P>

Notice that the overview page is created only if you pass into
<B>javadoc </B>

two or more package names.
For further explanation,
see HTML Frames.
<P>

The title on the overview page is set by
<B>-doctitle .</B>

</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-public</B>

<DD>
Shows only public classes and members.
<DT><B>-protected</B>

<DD>
Shows only protected and public classes and members.
This is the default.
<DT><B>-package</B>

<DD>
Shows only package, protected, and public classes and
members.
<DT><B>-private</B>

<DD>
Shows all classes and members.
<DT><B>-help</B>

<DD>
Displays the online help, which lists these
<B>javadoc </B>

and doclet command line options.
<DT><B>-doclet</B><I> class</I>

<DD>
Specifies the class file that starts the doclet used in
generating the documentation.
Use the fully-qualified name.
This doclet defines the content
and formats the output.
If the
<B>-doclet </B>

option is not used,
<B>javadoc </B>

uses the standard doclet for generating the default
HTML format.
This class must contain the start(Root) method.
The path to this starting class is defined by the
<B>-docletpath</B>

option.
</DL>
<P>

For example, to call the MIF doclet, use:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-doclet com.sun.tools.doclets.mif.MIFDoclet
</PRE>


</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-docletpath</B><I> classpathlist</I>

<DD>
Specifies the path to the doclet class file (specified
with the 
<B>-doclet </B>

option) and any jar files it depends on.
If the starting class file is in a jar file,
then this specifies the path to that jar
file, as shown in the example below.
You can specify an absolute path or
a path relative to the current directory.
If
<B>classpath</B>

contains multiple paths or jar files,
they should be separated with a colon (<B>:</B>)
on Windows.
This option is not necessary if the
doclet is already in the search path.
</DL>
<P>

Example of path to jar file that contains the
startig doclet class file. Notice the jar
filename is included.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-1.1</B>

<DD>
This feature has been removed from Javadoc 1.4. There is no replacement for it.
This option created documentation with the appearance and functionality
of documentation generated by Javadoc 1.1 (including never supporting nested
classes). If you need this option, use Javadoc 1.2 or 1.3 instead.
<DT><B>-sourcepath</B><I> sourcepathlist</I>

<DD>
Specifies the search paths for finding source files (<B>.java</B>)
when passing package names or -subpackages into the
<B>javadoc </B>

command.
The
<B>sourcepathlist</B>

can contain multiple paths by separating them with a
colon (<B>:</B>). The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool will search in all subdirectories of the specified paths.
Note that this option is not only used to located the
source files being documented, but also to find source
files that are not being documented but whose comments
are inherited by the source files being documented.
</DL>
<P>

Note that you can use the
<B>-sourcepath </B>

option only when passing
package names into the
<B>javadoc </B>

command - it will not locate
<B>.java </B>

files passed into the
<B>javadoc </B>

command.
(To locate 
<B>.java</B>

files, cd to that directory or include the path ahead of each
file, as shown at Documenting One or More Classes.)  If
<B>-sourcepath </B>

is omitted,
<B>javadoc </B>

uses the class path to find
the source files (see
<B>-classpath</B>).

Therefore, the default
<B>-sourcepath </B>

is the value of class path.
If 
<B>-classpath </B>

is omitted and you are passing package names into
<B>javadoc</B>,

it looks in the current directory (and subdirectories) for the
source files.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Set
<I>sourcepathlist</I>

to the root directory of the source tree
for the package you are documenting.
For example, suppose you
want to document a package called
<B>com.mypackage</B>

whose source
files are located at:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
/home/user/src/com/mypackage/*.java
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

In this case, you would specify the source path to
<B>/home/user/src</B>,

the directory that contains
<B>com/mypackage</B>,

and then supply the package name 
<B>com.mypackage</B>:

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
example% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src/ com.mypackage
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

This is easy to remember by noticing that if you concatenate
the value of the source path and the package name together and
change the dot to a slash &quot;/&quot;, you end up with the full path
to the package: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
/home/user/src/com/mypackage
</DL>

To point to two source paths:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</B><PRE>
example% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src/:/home/user2/src com.mypackage
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-classpath</B><I> classpathlist</I>

<DD>
Specifies the paths where
<B>javadoc </B>

looks for referenced
classes (<B>.class</B> files) - these are the documented classes plus any
classes referenced by those classes. 
The 
<I>classpathlist</I>

can contain multiple paths by separating them with a colon (<B>:</B>).
The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will search in
all subdirectories of the specified paths.
Follow the instructions in class path documentation for
specifying
<I>classpathlist</I>.

</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
If 
<B>-sourcepath </B>

is omitted, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool uses 
<B>-classpath </B>

to find
the source files as well as class files (for backward
compatibility).
Therefore, if you want to search for source
and class files in separate paths, use both
<B>-sourcepath </B>

and
<B>-classpath</B>.

<P>

For example, if you want to document
<B>com.mypackage</B>,

whose source files reside in the directory 
<B>/home/user/src/com/mypackage</B>,

and if this package relies on a library in 
<B>/home/user/lib</B>,

you would specify:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
example% javadoc -classpath /home/user/lib -sourcepath \
               /home/user/src com.mypackage
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

As with other tools, if you do not specify
<B>-classpath</B>,

the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool uses the CLASSPATH environment variable, if it is set.
If both are not set, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool searches for classes from
the current directory.
<P>

For an in-depth description of how the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool uses
<B>-classpath </B>

to find user classes as it relates to extension classes and
bootstrap classes, see How Classes Are Found.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-bootclasspath</B><I> classpathlist</I>

<DD>
Specifies the paths where the boot classes reside.
These are
nominally the Java platform classes.
The
<B>bootclasspath</B>

is part of
the search path the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will use to look up source and class
files.
See How Classes Are Found for more details.
Separate directories in
<I>classpathlist</I>

with colons (:).
<DT><B>-extdirs</B><I> dirlist</I>

<DD>
Specifies the directories where extension classes reside.
These are any classes that use the Java Extension mechanism.
The
<B>extdirs</B>

is part of the search path the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will use to
look up source and class files.
See
<B>-classpath </B>

(above) for
more details.
Separate directories in
<I>dirlist</I>

with colons (:).
<DT><B>-verbose</B>

<DD>
Provides more detailed messages while
<B>javadoc </B>

is running.
Without the verbose option, messages appear for loading the
source files, generating the documentation (one message per
source file), and sorting.
The verbose option causes the
printing of additional messages specifying the number of
milliseconds to parse each java source file.
<DT><B>-quiet</B>

<DD>
Shuts off non-error and non-warning messages, leaving
only the warnings and errors appear, making them easier
to view. Also suppresses the version string.
<DT><B>-locale</B><I> language_country_variant</I>

<DD>
<B>Important: The -locale option must be placed</B>

<B>ahead</B>

(to the left) of any options provided by the standard doclet or any
other doclet. Otherwise, the navigation bars will appear in English.
This is the only command-line option that is order-dependent.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Specifies the locale that
<B>javadoc </B>

uses when generating
documentation.
The argument is the name of the locale, as
described in java.util.Locale documentation, such as en_US
(English, United States) or en_US_WIN (Windows variant).
<P>

Specifying a locale causes
<B>javadoc </B>

to choose the resource
files of that locale for messages (strings in the navigation
bar, headings for lists and tables, help file contents,
comments in
<B>stylesheet.css</B>,

and so forth).
It also specifies
the sorting order for lists sorted alphabetically, and the
sentence separator to determine the end of the first sentence.
It does not determine the locale of the doc comment
text specified in the source files of the documented classes.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-encoding</B><I> name</I>

<DD>
Specifies the source file encoding name, such as EUCJIS/SJIS.
If this option is not specified, the platform default
converter is used.
<DT><B>-J</B><I>flag</I>

<DD>
Passes flag directly to the runtime system java that runs
<B>javadoc</B>.

Notice there must be no space between the J and the
flag.
For example, if you need to ensure that the system sets
aside 32 megabytes of memory in which to process the
generated documentation, then you would call the
<B>-Xmx</B>

option of java as
follows:
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
example% javadoc -J-Xmx32m -J-Xms32m com.mypackage
</PRE>

<P>

To tell what version of javadoc you are using, call the
<B>-version</B>

option of java:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
example% javadoc -J-version
java version &quot;1.2&quot;

<A NAME="lbBG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options Provided by the Standard Doclet</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-d</B><I> directory</I>

<DD>
Specifies the destination directory where
<B>javadoc </B>

saves the generated HTML files.
(The &quot;d&quot; means &quot;destination.&quot;)  Omitting
this option causes the files to be saved to the current directory.
The value
<I>directory</I>

can be absolute or relative to
the current working directory.
As of 1.4, the destination directory is
automatically created when javadoc is run.
</DL>
<P>

For example, the following
generates the documentation for the
<B>com.mypackage</B>

package and
saves the results in the 
<B>/home/user/doc/ </B>

directory:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
example% javadoc -d /home/user/doc com.mypackage
</PRE>


</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-use</B>

<DD>
Includes one &quot;Use&quot; page for each documented class and
package.
The page describes what packages, classes, methods,
constructors, and fields use any API of the given class or package.
Given class C, things that use class C would include
subclasses of C, fields declared as C, methods that return C,
and methods and constructors with parameters of type C.
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
For example, look at what might appear on the &quot;Use&quot;
page for String.
The

Therefore,
<B>getName()</B>

uses String,
and you will find that method on the &quot;Use&quot; page for String.
<P>

Note that this documents only uses of the API, not the

If a method uses String in its implementation

that is not considered a &quot;use&quot; of String.

Creates links to existing

It takes one argument.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>extdocURL</I>

is the absolute or relative URL of the directory
containing the external javadoc-generated documentation you want
to link to. Examples are shown below. The package-list file must
be found in this directory (otherwise, use -linkoffline). The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool reads the package names from the package-list file and then
links to those packages at that URL. When the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool is run, the 
<I>extdocURL </I>

value is copied literally into the &lt;A HREF&gt; links
that are created. Therefore,
<I>extdocURL</I>

must be the URL to the directory, not to a file.
</DL>
<P>

You can use an absolute link for
<I>extdocURL</I>

to enable your docs to link to a document on any website,
or can use a relative link to link only to a relative
location. If relative, the value you pass in should be the
relative path from the destination directory (specified
with -d) to the diretory containing the packages being linked to.
<P>

When specifying an absolute link you normally use an http: link.
However, if you want to link to a file system that has no web
server, you can use a file: link - however, do this only if everyone
wanting to access the generated documentation shares the same
file system.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
You can specify multiple -link options in a given javadoc run
to link to multiple documents.
<P>

Choosing between -linkoffline and -link -
One or the other option is appropriate when linking to an
API document that is external to the current javadoc run.
<P>

Use -link:
*
when using a relative path to the external API document, or
*
when using an absolute URL to the external API document, if you
shell does not allow a program to open a connection to that URL for 
reading.
<P>

Use -linkoffline:
*
when using an absolute URL to the external API document, if your shell
does not allow a program to open a connection to that URL for reading.
This can occur if you are behind a firewall and the document
you want to link to is on the other side.
<P>

Example using absolute links to the external docs -
Let's say you want to link to the java.lang, java.io and
other Java 2 Platform packages at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api.">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api.</A>
The following command generates documentation for the package
com.mypackage with links to the Java 2 Platform
packages. The generated documentation will contain links to
the Object class, for example in the class trees. (Other options,
such as -sourcepath and -d, are not shown.)
<P>

</DL>

<P>

Example using relative links to the external docs -
Let's say you have two packages whose docs are generated
in different runs of the 
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool, and those docs are separated by a relative path.
In this example, the packages are com.apipackage, and API,
and com.spipackage, an SPI (Service Provide Interface).
YOu want the documentation to reside in docs/api/com/apipackage
and docs/spi/com/spipackage. Assuming the API package documentation
is already generated, and that docs is the current directory,
you would document the SPI package with links to the API 
documentation by running:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
% javadoc -d ./spi -link ../api com.spipackage
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Notice the -link argument is relative to the destination
directory (docs/spi).
<P>

Details - 
The -link option enables you to link to classes referenced
to by your code but not documented in the current javadoc run.
For these links to go to valid pages, you must know where those
HTML pages are located, and specify that location with
<I>extdocURL .</I>

This allows, for instance, third party documentation to link to
java.* documentation on <A HREF="http://java.sun.com.">http://java.sun.com.</A>
<P>

Omit the -link option for javadoc to create links only to
API within the documentation it is generating in the current run.
(Without the -link option, the 
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool does not create links to documentation for
external references, because it does not know if
or where that documentation exists.
<P>

This option can create links in several places in the 
generated documentation.
<P>

Another use is for cross-links
between sets of packages: Execute
<B>javadoc </B>

on one set of
packages, then run
<B>javadoc </B>

again on another set of packages,
creating links both ways between both sets.
A third use is as
a &quot;hack&quot; to update docs: Execute
<B>javadoc </B>

on a full set of
packages, then run
<B>javadoc </B>

again on only the smaller set of
changed packages, so that the updated files can be inserted
back into the original set.
<P>

Bug Fix for Referenced Classes -
In 1.4 the following bug has been fixed:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
Link bug in 1.2 and 1.3 - When @see or {<B>@link</B>}
references an excluded class and -link is used,
an &lt;A HREF&gt; hyperlink is created only if the class is referenced
with in an import statement or in a declaration. References
in the body of methods, alone are inadequate. A workaround
was to include an explicit (not wildcard) import
statement for the referenced class.
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

An see or {<B>@link</B>} reference with -link is now enough to
load the referenced class and enable a link to it. You can remove
any import statements you had added as workarounds, which we had
suggested you comment as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>

</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

<B>Package List -</B>

The 
<B>-link </B>

option requires that a file named
<B>package-list</B>,

which is generated by the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool, 
exist at the URL
you specify with 
<B>-link</B>.

The 
<B>package-list </B>

file is a simple
text file that lists the names of packages documented at that
location.
In an earlier example, the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool looks for a file named
<B>package-list</B>

at the given URL, reads in the package names
and then links to those packages at that URL.
<P>

For example, the package list for the Java Platform v1.4 API
is located at

</DL>

<P>

When
<B>javadoc </B>

is run without the 
<B>-link </B>

option, when it encounters a name that belongs to an
external referenced class, it prints the name with no link.
However, when the 
<B>-link</B>

option is used, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool searches the
<B>package-list </B>

file at the specified 
<I>extdocURL </I>

location for that
package name.
If it finds the package name, it prefixes the
name with 
<I>extdocURL .</I>

<P>

In order for there to be no broken links, all of the
documentation for the external references must exist at the
specified URLs. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool does not check that these pages exist, only that the 
<B>package-list </B>

exists. 
<P>

<B>Multiple Links: -</B>

You can supply multiple-link options to
link to any number of external generated documents.
Javadoc 1.2 has a known bug that prevents you from
supplying more than one 
<B>-link </B>

command.
This was fixed in 1.2.2.
<P>

Specify a different link option for each external document to
link to:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<B>extdocURL2</B>,  ...

<B>extdocURLn</B>

point respectively to
the roots of external documents, each of which contains a
file named 
<B>package-list</B>.

<P>

<B>Cross-links -</B>

Note that &quot;bootstrapping&quot; may be required when
cross-linking two or more documents that have not been previously
generated.
In other words, if 
<B>package-list </B>

does not
exist for either document, when you run the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool on the first
document, the 
<B>package-list </B>

does not yet exist for the second
document.
Therefore, to create the external links, you must
rree-generate the first document after generating the second
document.
<P>

In this case, the purpose of first generating a document is
to create its 
<B>package-list </B>

(or you can create it by hand
if you are certain of the package names).
Then generate the
second document with its external links. The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool prints a
warning if a needed external 
<B>package-list </B>

file does not exist.
<B>html</B>.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-linkoffline</B><I> extdocURL  packagelistLoc</I>

<DD>
This option is a varition of 
<B>-link</B>;

they both create links to javadoc-generated
documentation for external referenced classes.
Use the
<B>-linkoffline</B>

option when linking to a document on the web when the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool itself is &quot;offline&quot; - that is, it cannot access
the document through a web connection.
</DL>
<P>

More specifically, use
<B>-linkoffline</B>

is the external document's
<B>package-list</B>

file is not accessible or does not exist at the
<I>extdocURL</I>

location but does exist at a different location,
which can be specified by
<I>packageListLoc</I>

(typically local). Thus, is
<I>extdocURL</I>

is accessible only on the World Wide Web,
<B>-linkoffline</B>

removes the constraint that the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool have a web connection when generating the
documentation. Examples are given below.
<P>

The
<B>-linkoffline</B>

option takes two arguments - the first for the
string to be embedded in the &lt;a href&gt; links, the
second telling it where to find
<B>package-list:</B>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<I>extdocURL</I>

is the absolute or relative URL of the directory containing the 
external <B>javadoc</B>-generated documentation you want to
link to.
If relative, the value should be the relative path from the
destination directory (specified with -d)
to the root of the packages being linked to.
For more details see
<I>extdocURL</I>

in the
<B>-link</B>

option.
<DT>*<DD>
<I>packagelistLoc</I>

is the path or URL to the directory containing
the 
<B>package-list </B>

file for the external documentation.
This can be a URL (http: or file:) or
file path, and can be absolute or relative.
If relative, make it relative to the current directory
from where javadoc was run. Do not include the
<B>package-list</B>

filename.
</DL>
<P>

You can specify multiple
<B>-linkoffline</B>

options in a given
<B>javadoc</B>

run.
(Prior to
1.2.2, it could be specified only once.)
<P>

Example using absolute links to the external docs - 
Let's say you want to
link to the 
<B>java.lang</B>,

<B>java.io</B>

and other Java 2 Platform packages at
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api,">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api,</A> but your shell does not have web
access. You could open the 
<B>package-list</B>

file in a browser at
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/package-list,">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/package-list,</A> save it to a local
directory, and point to this local copy with the second argument, 
<I>packagelistLoc .</I>

In this example, the package list 
file has been saved to the current directory &quot;.&quot; .
The following command generates documentation for the package
com.mypackage with links to the Java 2 Platform packages. The generated
documentation will contain links to the Object class, for example, in the class
trees. (Other necessary options, such as -sourcepath, are not shown.)

</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Example using relative links to the external docs - 
It's not very common to
use 
<B>-linkoffline </B>

with relative paths, for the simple reason that 
<B>-link </B>

usually
suffices. When using 
<B>-linkoffline, the </B>

<B>package-list</B>

file is generally local, and
when using relative links, the file you are 
linking to is also generally local. So it
is usually unnecessary to give a different path for the two arguments to
<B>-linkoffline . </B>

When the two arguments are identical, you can use 
<B>-link . </B>

See the
<B>-link </B>

relative example. 
<P>

Manually Creating A package-list File - 
If a 
<B>package-list</B>

file does not yet
exist, but you know what package names your document will link to, you can
create your own copy of this file by hand and specify its path with
<I>packagelistLoc . </I>

An example would be the previous case where the package list
for com.spipackage did not exist when com.apipackage was first generated. This
technique is useful when you need to generate documentation that links to new
external documentation whose package names you know, but which is not yet
published. This is also a way of creating package-list files for packages
generated with Javadoc 1.0 or 1.1, where package-list files were not generated.
Likewise, two companies can share their unpublished package-list files,
enabling them to release their cross-linked documentation simultaneously. 
<P>

Linking to Multiple Documents - 
You can include 
<B>-linkoffline </B>

once for
each generated document you want to refer to (each option is shown on a
separate line for clarity): 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>

example% javadoc  -linkoffline docURL1 packagelistURL1 \

</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<B>Updating Docs -</B>

Another use for the 
<B>-linkoffline </B>

option is useful if
your project has dozens or hundreds of packages; if you have
already run
<B>javadoc </B>

on the entire tree; and now, in a
separate run, you want to quickly make some small changes and
re-run
<B>javadoc </B>

on just a small portion of the source tree.
This is somewhat of a hack in that it works properly only if
your changes are only to doc comments and not to signatures.
If you were to add, remove, or change any signatures from the
source code, then broken links could show up in the index,
package tree, inherited member lists, use page, or other
places.
<P>

First, you create a new destination directory (call it update)
for this new
small run. Set the first argument of
<B>-linkoffline </B>

to the current directory &quot;.&quot; and
set the second argument to the relative path to the
original docs (call it html), where it
can find
<B>package-list:</B>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
example% javadoc -d update -linkoffline . html com.mypackage

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-linksource<DD>
Creates an HTML version of each source file (with line numbers) and adds links
to them from the standard HTML documentation. This option exposes all
private implementation details in the included source files, including
private classes, private fields, and the bodies of private methods,
regardless of the -public, -package, -protected and -private options. Unless
you also use the -private option, not all private classes or interfaces will
necessarily be accessible via links.
<DT><B>-group</B><I> groupheading  packagepattern:packagepattern:...</I>

<DD>
Separates packages on the overview page into whatever groups
you specify, one group per table.
You specify each group with
a different 
<B>-group </B>

option.
The groups appear on the page in
the order specified on the command line; packages are
alphabetized within a group.
For a given
<B>-group </B>

option, the
packages matching the list of
<I>packagepattern</I>

expressions appear in a table with the heading
<I>groupheading</I>.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<I>groupheading</I>

can be any text, and can include white space.
This text is placed in the table heading for the group.

<I>packagepattern</I>

can be any package name, or can be the
start of any package name followed by an asterisk (*).
The asterisk is a wildcard meaning &quot;match any
characters&quot;.
This is the only wildcard allowed.
Multiple patterns can be included in a group by separating them
with colons (:).
</DL>
<P>

NOTE: If using an asterisk in a pattern or pattern
list, the pattern list must be inside quotes, such
as &quot;java.lang*:java.util&quot;.
<P>

If you do not supply any
<B>-group </B>

option, all packages are
placed in one group with the heading &quot;Packages&quot;.
If the all
groups do not include all documented packages, any leftover
packages appear in a separate group with the heading &quot;Other
Packages&quot;.
<P>

For example, the following option separates the four
documented packages into core, extension, and other packages.
Notice the trailing &quot;dot&quot; does not appear in &quot;<B>java.lang*</B>&quot;;
including the dot, such as &quot;<B>java.lang.*</B>&quot;, would omit the

option is useful when you are interested only in
the content and have no need for navigation, such as
converting the files to PostScript or PDF for print only.
<DT><B>-helpfile</B><I> path/filename</I>

<DD>
Specifies the path of an alternate help file
<I>path/filename</I>

that the HELP link in the top and bottom navigation bars link
to. Without this option, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool automatically creates a help file 
<B>help-doc.html </B>

that is hard-coded in the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool. 
This option
enables you to override this default.
The filename can be any
name and is not restricted to <B>help-doc.html</B>;
the

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-stylesheetfile</B><I> path/filename</I>

<DD>
Specifies the path of an alternate HTML stylesheet file.
Without this option, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool automatically creates a
stylesheet file,
<B>stylesheet.css</B>,

that is hard-coded in the
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool.
This option enables you to override this default.
The filename can be any name and is not restricted to
<B>stylesheet.css</B>.

For example:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-serialwarn</B>

<DD>
Generates compile-time warnings for missing
<B>@serial</B>

tags.
By default,
<B>Javadoc</B>

1.2.2 (and later versions) generates no serial warnings.
(This is a reversal from earlier versions.)  Use this option to
display the serial warnings, which helps
to properly document default serializable fields and
writeExternal methods.
<DT><B>-charset</B><I> name</I>

<DD>
Specifies the HTML character set for this document.
For example:
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
% javadoc -charset &quot;iso-8859-1&quot; mypackage
</B>
</DL>

<P>

would insert the following line in the head of every
generated page:
</DL>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
&lt;META http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=iso-885 9-1&quot;&gt;
</B>
<P>

This META tag is described in the HTML standard
(4197265 and 4137321).
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-docencoding</B><I> name</I>

<DD>
Specifies the encoding of the generated HTML files.
<B>-source</B><I>1.4</I>

Necessary to enable javadoc to handle assertions present in J2SE v 1.4 source
code. This option documents code that compiles using &quot;javac -source 1.4&quot;
<DT><B>-tag</B><I> tagname:Xaoptcmf:</I>

<DD>
Enables javadoc to interpret a simple, one-argument custom standalone tag
<B>@tagname</B>

in doc comments. So the Javadoc tool can &quot;spell-check&quot; tag names, it
is important to include a 
<B>-tag </B>

option for every custom tag that is present in the
source code, disabling (with X) those that are not 
being output in the current run.
</DL>
<P>

The -tag option outputs the tag's heading taghead 
in bold, followed on the next
line by the text from its single argument, as 
shown in the example below. Like
any standalone tag, this argument's text can 
contain inline tags, which are also
interpreted. The output is similar to standard 
one-argument tags, such as
@return and @author. 
<P>

Placement of tags -
The Xaoptcmf part of the argument determines where in
the source code the tag is allowed to be 
placed, and whether the tag can be
disabled (using X). You can supply either a, 
to allow the tag in all places, or any
combination of the other letters: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
X (disable tag)
a (all)
o (overview)
p (packages)
t (types, that is classes and interfaces)
c (constructors)
m (methods)
f (fields)
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Examples of single tags -
An example of a tag option for a tag that can be 
used anywhere in the source code is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-tag todo:a:&quot;To Do:&quot;
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

If you wanted @todo to be used only with constructors,
methods and fields, you would use:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-tag todo:cmf:&quot;To Do:&quot;
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Notice the last colon (:) above is not a 
parameter separator, but is part of the
heading text (as shown below). You 
would use either tag option for source code
that contains the tag @todo, such as: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
@todo The documentation for this method needs work.
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

This line would produce output something like:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
To Do:
                  The documentation for this method needs work.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD><B>Spell-checking tag names (Disabling tags) -
Some developers put custom
tags in the source code that they don't 
always want to output. In these cases, it
is important to list all tags that are 
present in the source code, enabling the ones
you want to output and disabling the ones you 
don't want to output. The
presence of X disables the tag, while its absence 
enables the tag. This gives the
Javadoc </B>
tool enough information to know if a tag it encounters is unknown,
probably the results of a typo or a 
misspelling. It prints a warning in these cases.

You can add X to the placement values already 
present, so that when you want
to enable the tag, you can simply delete 
the X. For example, if @todo is a tag that
you want to suppress on output, you would use: 

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD><B>-tag todo:Xcmf:&quot;To Do:&quot;
</B></PRE>


</DL>

<P>

or, if you'd rather keep it simple:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-tag todo:X
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The syntax -tag todo:X works even if @todo is defined by a taglet. 
<P>

Order of tags -
The order of the -tag (and -taglet) options determine the
order the tags are output. You can mix the 
custom tags with the standard tags to
intersperse them. The tag options for standard tags 
are placeholders only for
determining the order -- they take only the 
standard tag's name. (Subheadings
for standard tags cannot be altered.) This is 
illustrated in the following example. 
<P>

If -tag is missing, then the position of -taglet 
determines its order. If they are
both present, then whichever appears 
last on the command line determines its
order. (This happens because the tags and 
taglets are processed in the order that
they appear on the command line. For 
example, if -taglet and -tag both have
the name &quot;todo&quot;, the one that appears 
last on the command line will determine
its order. 
<P>

Example of a complete set of tags -
This example inserts &quot;To Do&quot; after
&quot;Parameters&quot; and before &quot;Throws&quot; in the output. By using &quot;X&quot;, it also specifies
that @example is a tag that might be encountered in the source code that should
not be output during this run. Notice that if you use @argfile, you can put the
tags on separate lines in an argument file like this (no line continuation
characters needed): 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
,nf
-tag param
-tag return
-tag todo:a:&quot;To Do:&quot;
-tag throws
-tag see
-tag example:X

</B>
</DL>

<P>

When javadoc parses the doc comments, any tag encountered that is neither a
standard tag nor passed in with -tag or -taglet is considered unknown, and a
warning is thrown. 
<P>

The standard tags are initially stored internally 
in a list in their default order.
Whenever -tag options are used, 
those tags get appended to this list --
standard tags are moved from their default position. 
Therefore, if a -tag option
is omitted for a standard tag, it 
remains in its default position. 
<P>

Avoiding Conflicts -
If you want to slice out your own namespace, you can use
a dot-separated naming convention similar to 
that used for packages:
com.mycompany.todo. Sun will continue to 
create standard tags whose names do
not contain dots. Any tag you create will 
override the behavior of a tag by the
same name defined by Sun. In other words, if you create 
a tag or taglet @todo, it
will always have the same behavior you define, 
even if Sun later creates a
standard tag of the same name. 
<P>

You can also create more complex standalone tags, or custom inline tags with
the -taglet option. 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-taglet &quot; class&quot;<DD>
Specifies the class file that starts the taglet used in
generating the documentation for that tag. Use the
fully-qualified name for 
<I>class . </I>

This taglet also 
defines the number of text arguments that the custom
tag has. The taglet accepts those arguments, processes 
them, and generates the output. For extensive
documentation with example taglets, see Taglet Overview.
</DL>
<P>

Taglets are useful for standalone or inline tags. 
They can have any number of arguments and
implement custom behavior, such as making 
text bold, formatting bullets, writing out the text to a file,
or starting other processes.
<P>

Use the 
<B>-tagletpath </B>

option to specify the path to the taglet. 
Here is an example that inserts the &quot;To
Do&quot; taglet after &quot;Parameters&quot; and ahead 
of &quot;Throws&quot; in the generated pages: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-taglet com.sun.tools.doclets.ToDoTaglet
-tagletpath /home/taglets
-tag return
-tag param
-tag todo
-tag throws
-tag see
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Alternatively, you can use the
<B>-taglet</B>

option in place of its
<B>-tag </B>

option, but that may be harder to read.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-tagletpath &quot; tagletpathlist&quot;<DD>
Specifies the search paths for finding taglet 
class files (.class). The 
<I>tagletpathlist </I>

can contain multiple
paths by separating them with a colon (:). The 
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool will search in all subdirectories of the
specified paths.
<DT>-subpackages &quot; package1:package2:...&quot;<DD>
Generates documentation from source files in
the specified packages and recursively in their
subpackages. This option is useful when adding 
new subpackages to the source code, as they are
automatically included. Each 
<I>package </I>

is any top-level 
package (java) or fully qualified subpackage
javax.swing), and does not need to contain source files. 
Wildcards are not needed or allowed.
Use 
<B>-sourcepath </B>

to specify where to find the packages. For example: 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
% javadoc -d docs -sourcepath /home/user/src \
                  -subackages java:javax.swing
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

This command generates documentation for packages
name &quot;java&quot; and &quot;javax.swing&quot; and all their subpackages.
<P>

There is also an option to exclude subpackages as it traverses
the subpackages.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-exclude &quot; packagename1:packagename2:...&quot;<DD>
Unconditionally excludes the specified packages 
and their subpackages from the list formed by
-subpackages. It excludes those packages even 
if they would otherwise be included by some
previous or later -subpackages option. For example: 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src -sourcepath java\
                  -exclude java.net:java.lang
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

would include
<B>java.io</B>,

<B>java.util</B>,

and
<B>java.math</B>

(among others), but would exclude packages
rooted at
<B>java.net</B>

and
<B>java.lang</B>.

Notice this excludes
<B>java.lang.ref</B>,

a subpackage of
<B>java.lang</B>).

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-breakiterator<DD>
Uses the sentence break iterator to determine
<BR>&nbsp;the&nbsp;end&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;sentence.&nbsp;We&nbsp;plan&nbsp;
to change the algorithm for determining 
the end of the first sentence in the 
next major feature release - the
-breakiterator option uses this new 
algorithm. We recommend you use this option whenever
running version 1.4 so that your transition 
to the next major release will be seamless. 
</DL>
<P>

In 1.2 and 1.3, the 
<B>java.text.BreakIterator</B>

class was used to determine the end of sentence for all
languages but English. Therefore, the -breakiterator 
option has an effect only for English. English
had its own algorithm, which looked for a period 
followed by a space. When -breakiterator is
omitted, the end of the first sentence is 
unchanged from 1.2 and 1.3, and warnings are emitted
displaying where there would be a difference. 
<P>

Differences in the algorithms show up in English as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
Old algorithm - Stops at a period followed by a space or
a paragraph-level HTML tag, such as &lt;P&gt;.
<DT>*<DD>
New algorithm - Stops at a period, question mark or
exclamation mark followed by a space if the next word
starts with a capital letter. This is meant to handle
most abbreviations (such as &quot;Serial no. is valid&quot;,but
won't handle &quot;Mr. Smith&quot;). Won't stop at HTML tags
or sentences that begin with numbers or symbols.
<DT>-docfilessubdirs<DD>
Enables deep copying of &quot;doc-files&quot; directories. 
In other words, subdirectories and all contents
are recursively copied to the destination. 
For example, the directory 
<B>doc-files/example/images</B>

and all its contents would now be copied. 
There is also an option to exclude subdirectories. 
<DT>-excludedocfilessubdirs &quot; name1:name2:...&quot;<DD>
Excludes any &quot;doc-files&quot; subdirectories with the 
given names. This prevents the copying of SCCS
and other source-code-control subdirectories. 
<DT>-noqualifier &quot; all | packagename1:packagename2:...&quot;<DD>
Omits qualifying package name from ahead of 
class names in output. The argument to
-noqualifier is either &quot;all&quot; (all 
package qualifiers are omitted) or a colon-separate list of
packages, with wildcards, to be removed 
as qualifiers. The package name is removed from places
where class or interface names appear. 
</DL>
<P>

The following example omits all package qualifiers:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-noqualifier all
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The following example omits &quot;java.lang&quot; 
and &quot;java.io&quot; package qualifiers:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-noqualifier java.lang:java.io
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

The following example omits package qualifiers
starting with &quot;java&quot;, and &quot;com.sun&quot;
subpackages (but not &quot;javax&quot;):
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
-noqualifier java.*:com.sun.*
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

Where a package qualifier would appear due 
to the above behavior, the following 
behavior (present in 1.3) also takes effect 
to further omit qualifiers: On the page for 
class 
<B>p.C</B>,

remove the package qualifier for classes 
belonging to package 
<B>p</B>.

This rule is present whether or not 
-noqualifier is used.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-nocomment<DD>
Suppress the entire comment body, 
including the description and all tags, 
generating only declarations. This 
option enables re-using source files 
originally intended for a different purpose, to
produce a skeleton perhaps for a new project.

<H3>Command Line Argument Files</H3>

TO shorten or simplify the javadoc command line,
you can specify one or more files that themselves
contain arguments to the 
<B>javadoc</B>

command (except -J options).
This enables you to create 
<B>javadoc</B>

commands of any length on any operating system.
<P>

An argument file can include Javadoc options, 
source filenames and package names in 
any combination, or just arguments to 
Javadoc options. The arguments within a file 
can be space-separated or
newline-separated. Filenames within an argument 
file are relative to the current directory, 
not the location of
the argument file. Wildcards (*) are not allowed 
in these lists (such as for specifying *.java). 
Use of the '@'
character to recursively interpret files 
is not supported. The -J options are not 
supported because they are
passed to the launcher, which does not 
support argument files. 
<P>

When executing
<B>javadoc</B>,

pass in the path and name of each
argument file with the '@' leading
character. When
<B>javadoc</B>

encounters an argument beginning with 
the character '@', it expands the
contents of that file in the argument list.
<P>

Example - Single Arg File
<P>

You could use a single argument file named &quot;argfile&quot;
to hold all Javadoc arguments:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>
</B><PRE>
% javadoc @argfile
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

This argument file could contain the contents of 
both files shown in the next example.
<P>

Example - Two Arg Files
<P>

You can create two argument files - one for the Javadoc
options and the other for the package names or
source filenames: (Notice the following lists have
no line-continuation characters.)
<P>

Create a file named &quot;options&quot; containing:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

Examples - Option Arguments
<P>

Here's an example of saving just an 
argument to a javadoc option in an argument file. 
We'll use the -bottom
option, since it can have a lengthy 
argument. You could create a file named &quot;bottom&quot; containing its text
argument: 
<P>

Version Numbers -

<BR>&nbsp;more&nbsp;details,&nbsp;see&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Doclet.
<A NAME="lbBK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIMPLE EXAMPLES</H2>

You can run
<B>javadoc </B>

on entire packages or individual source files.
Each package name has a corresponding directory name.
In the following
examples, the source files are located at
<B>/home/src/java/awt/*java</B>.

The destination directory is 
<B>/home/html</B>.

<A NAME="lbBL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Documenting One or More Packages</H3>

To document a package, the source files (*<B>.java</B>) for that package
must be located in a directory having the same name as the package.
If a package name is made up of several identifiers
(separated by dots, such as java.awt.color), 
each subsequent identifier must correspond to a deeper
subdirectory (such as java/awt/color).
You may split the source files for a single 
package among two such directory trees located
at different places, as long as -sourcepath
points to them both - for example
<B>src1/java/awt/color</B>

and
<B>src2/java/awt/color</B>.

<P>

You can run
<B>javadoc </B>

either by changing directories (with cd) or by using
<B>-sourcepath</B>

option.
The examples below illustrate both alternatives.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<B>Case 1 - Run recursively starting from one or more packages -</B>

This example uses 
<B>-sourcepath</B>

so javadoc can be run from any directory. It traverses
the subpackages of java excluding packages
rooted at
<B>java.net</B>

and 
<B>java.lang</B>.

Notice this excludes
<B>java.lang.ref</B>,

a subpackage of 
<B>java.lang</B>).

</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

To also traverse down other package trees, append
their names to the
<B>-subpackages</B>

argument, such as
<B>java:javax:org.xml.sax</B>.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
&quot;Case 2 - Run on explicit packages after changing to
the &quot;root&quot; source directory -&quot;
Change to the
parent directory of the fully qualified package.
Then run
<B>javadoc</B>,

supplying names of one or more packages you want to document:

<B>Case 3 - Run from any directory on explicit packages</B>

in a single directory tree -&quot;
In this case, it does not matter
what the current directory is.
Run
<B>javadoc </B>

supplying
<B>-sourcepath </B>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
<B>Case 4 - Run from any directory on explicit</B>

packages in multiple directory trees -&quot; 
This is the same as case 3, but for packages in
separate directory trees.
Run javadoc supplying 
<B>-sourcepath</B>

with the path to each tree's root (colon-separated)
<BR>&nbsp;and&nbsp;supply&nbsp;names&nbsp;of&nbsp;one&nbsp;or&nbsp;more&nbsp;packages&nbsp;you

<P>

Result: All cases generate HTML-formatted documentation for the public

<B>java.awt</B>

and
<B>java.awt.event</B>

and save the HTML files in the specified
destination directory (<B>/home/html</B>).

<H3>Documenting One or More Classes</H3>

The second way to run the
<B>Javadoc</B>

You can run
<B>javadoc </B>

either of the following two
ways: by changing directories (with cd) or by
fully specifying
the path to the

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the
classes Button, Canvas, and classes beginning with Graphics.
Because source files rather than package names were passed in
as arguments to

the document has two frames - for
the list of classes and the main page.

<H3>Documenting Both Packages and Classes</H3>

You can document entire packages and individual classes at the
same time.
Here is an example that mixes the two previous examples.
You can use 
<B>-sourcepath </B>

for the path to the packages but not for
the path to the individual classes:

</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for the
package
<B>java.awt and</B>

<B>class Applet.</B>

The
<B>Javadoc</B>

tool determines the package
name for
<B>Applet</B>

from the package declaration, if any, in the
<B>Applet.java </B>

source file.)
<A NAME="lbBO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Real World Example</H3>

The
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool has many useful options, some of which are more commonly
used than others.
Here is effectively the command you need to run the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool on the Java platform API. We use
180MB of memory to generate the documentation
for the 1500 (approx.) public and protected
classes in the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.2.
<P>

The same example is shown twice - first as executed on the 
command line, then as execued from a makefile. It
uses absolute paths in the option arguments,
which enables the same
<B>javadoc</B>

command to be run from any directory.
<A NAME="lbBP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Command Line Example</H3>

This command line example is over 900 characters, 
which is too long from some shells, such as DOS.
You can use a command line argument file (or
write a shell script) to workaround this limitation.

<H3>Notes</H3>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>
If you omit the 
<B>-windowtitle </B>

option, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool copies the doc title
to the window title. The 
<B>-windowtitle </B>

text is basically the same as the
<B>-doctitle</B>

but without HTML tags,
to prevent those tags from appearing
as raw text in the window title).
<DT>*<DD>
If you omit the
<B>-footer </B>

option, as done here, the
<B>Javadoc </B>

tool
copies the
header text to the footer.
<DT>Other important options you might wan to use but<DD>
not needed in this example 
are
