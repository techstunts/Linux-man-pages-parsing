<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
The <B>verify</B> command verifies certificate chains.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND OPTIONS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-CApath directory</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
A directory of trusted certificates. The certificates should have names
of the form: hash.0 or have symbolic links to them of this
form (``hash'' is the hashed certificate subject name: see the <B>-hash</B> option
of the <B>x509</B> utility). Under Unix the <B>c_rehash</B> script will automatically
create symbolic links to a directory of certificates.
<DT><B>-CAfile file</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
A file of trusted certificates. The file should contain multiple certificates
in <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> format concatenated together.
<DT><B>-untrusted file</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
A file of untrusted certificates. The file should contain multiple certificates
<DT><B>-purpose purpose</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>
the intended use for the certificate. Without this option no chain verification
will be done. Currently accepted uses are <B>sslclient</B>, <B>sslserver</B>,
<B>nssslserver</B>, <B>smimesign</B>, <B>smimeencrypt</B>. See the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>VERIFY</B></FONT><B> </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>OPERATION</B></FONT><B></B>
section for more information.
<DT><B>-help</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>
prints out a usage message.
<DT><B>-verbose</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>
print extra information about the operations being performed.
<DT><B>-issuer_checks</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>
print out diagnostics relating to searches for the issuer certificate
of the current certificate. This shows why each candidate issuer
certificate was rejected. However the presence of rejection messages
does not itself imply that anything is wrong: during the normal
verify process several rejections may take place.
<DT><B>-</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
marks the last option. All arguments following this are assumed to be
certificate files. This is useful if the first certificate filename begins
with a <B>-</B>.
<DT><B>certificates</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
one or more certificates to verify. If no certificate filenames are included
then an attempt is made to read a certificate from standard input. They should
all be in <FONT SIZE="-1">PEM</FONT> format.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERIFY OPERATION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
The <B>verify</B> program uses the same functions as the internal <FONT SIZE="-1">SSL</FONT> and S/MIME
verification, therefore this description applies to these verify operations
too.
<P>

There is one crucial difference between the verify operations performed
by the <B>verify</B> program: wherever possible an attempt is made to continue
after an error whereas normally the verify operation would halt on the
first error. This allows all the problems with a certificate chain to be
determined.
<P>

The verify operation consists of a number of separate steps.
<P>

Firstly a certificate chain is built up starting from the supplied certificate
and ending in the root <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT>. It is an error if the whole chain cannot be built
up. The chain is built up by looking up the issuers certificate of the current
certificate. If a certificate is found which is its own issuer it is assumed 
to be the root <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT>.
<P>

The process of 'looking up the issuers certificate' itself involves a number
of steps. In versions of OpenSSL before 0.9.5a the first certificate whose
subject name matched the issuer of the current certificate was assumed to be
the issuers certificate. In OpenSSL 0.9.6 and later all certificates
whose subject name matches the issuer name of the current certificate are 
subject to further tests. The relevant authority key identifier components
of the current certificate (if present) must match the subject key identifier
(if present) and issuer and serial number of the candidate issuer, in addition
the keyUsage extension of the candidate issuer (if present) must permit
certificate signing.
<P>

The lookup first looks in the list of untrusted certificates and if no match
is found the remaining lookups are from the trusted certificates. The root <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT>
is always looked up in the trusted certificate list: if the certificate to
verify is a root certificate then an exact match must be found in the trusted
list.
<P>

The second operation is to check every untrusted certificate's extensions for
consistency with the supplied purpose. If the <B>-purpose</B> option is not included
then no checks are done. The supplied or ``leaf'' certificate must have extensions
compatible with the supplied purpose and all other certificates must also be valid
<FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT> certificates. The precise extensions required are described in more detail in
the <B></B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>CERTIFICATE</B></FONT><B> </B><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>EXTENSIONS</B></FONT><B></B> section of the <B>x509</B> utility.
<P>

The third operation is to check the trust settings on the root <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT>. The root
<FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT> should be trusted for the supplied purpose. For compatibility with previous
versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL a certificate with no trust settings is considered
to be valid for all purposes. 
<P>

The final operation is to check the validity of the certificate chain. The validity
period is checked against the current system time and the notBefore and notAfter
dates in the certificate. The certificate signatures are also checked at this
point.
<P>

If all operations complete successfully then certificate is considered valid. If
any operation fails then the certificate is not valid.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
When a verify operation fails the output messages can be somewhat cryptic. The
general form of the error message is:
<P>



<PRE>
 server.pem: /C=AU/ST=Queensland/O=CryptSoft Pty Ltd/CN=Test CA (1024 bit)
 error 24 at 1 depth lookup:invalid CA certificate

</PRE>


<P>

The first line contains the name of the certificate being verified followed by
the subject name of the certificate. The second line contains the error number
and the depth. The depth is number of the certificate being verified when a
problem was detected starting with zero for the certificate being verified itself
then 1 for the <FONT SIZE="-1">CA</FONT> that signed the certificate and so on. Finally a text version
of the error number is presented.
<P>

An exhaustive list of the error codes and messages is shown below, this also
includes the name of the error code as defined in the header file x509_vfy.h
Some of the error codes are defined but never returned: these are described
as ``unused''.
<DL COMPACT>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<A NAME="ixABX"></A>
Although the issuer checks are a considerably improvement over the old technique they still
suffer from limitations in the underlying X509_LOOKUP <FONT SIZE="-1">API</FONT>. One consequence of this is that
trusted certificates with matching subject name must either appear in a file (as specified by the
<B>-CAfile</B> option) or a directory (as specified by <B>-CApath</B>. If they occur in both then only
the certificates in the file will be recognised.
<P>

Previous versions of OpenSSL assume certificates with matching subject name are identical and
mishandled them.
