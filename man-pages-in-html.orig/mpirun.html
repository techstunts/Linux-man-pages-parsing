<B>Note:</B>

<DD>The
<I>-c2c</I>

and
<I>-lamd</I>

options are now obsolete.  Use 
<I>-ssi</I>

instead.  See the &quot;SSI&quot; section, below.



</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

There are two forms of the 
<I>mpirun</I>

command -- one for programs (i.e., SPMD-style applications), and one
for application schemas (see <A HREF="../man5/appschema.5.php">appschema</A>(5)).  Both forms of
<I>mpirun</I>

use the following options by default: 
<I>-nger </I>

<I>-w</I>.

These may each be overriden by their counterpart options, described
below.
<P>

Additionally, 
<I>mpirun</I>

will send the name of the directory where it was invoked on the local
node to each of the remote nodes, and attempt to change to that
directory.  See the &quot;Current Working Directory&quot; section, below.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c &lt;#&gt;</B>

<DD>
Synonym for 
<I>-np </I>

(see below).
<DT><B>-D</B>

<DD>
Use the executable program location as the current working directory
for created processes.  The current working directory of the created
processes will be set before the user's program is invoked.  This
option is mutually exclusive with
<I>-wd</I>.

<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Do not configure standard I/O file descriptors - use defaults.
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Print useful information on this command.
<DT><B>-ger</B>

<DD>
Enable GER (Guaranteed Envelope Resources) communication protocol
and error reporting.  See <A HREF="../man7/MPI.7.php">MPI</A>(7) for a description of GER.  This
option is mutually exclusive with 
<I>-nger</I>.

<DT><B>-nger</B>

<DD>
Disable GER (Guaranteed Envelope Resources).  This option is mutually
exclusive with 
<I>-ger</I>.

<DT><B>-nsigs</B>

<DD>
Do not have LAM catch signals in the user application.  This is the
default, and is mutually exclusive with
<I>-sigs</I>.

<DT><B>-np &lt;#&gt;</B>

<DD>
Run this many copies of the program on the given nodes.  This option
indicates that the specified file is an executable program and not an
application schema.  If no nodes are specified, all LAM nodes are
considered for scheduling; LAM will schedule the programs in a
round-robin fashion, &quot;wrapping around&quot; (and scheduling multiple copies
on a single node) if necessary.
<DT><B>-npty</B>

<DD>
Disable pseudo-tty support.  Unless you are having problems with
pseudo-tty support, you probably do not need this option.  Mutually
exlclusive with -pty.
<DT><B>-nw</B>

<DD>
Do not wait for all processes to complete before exiting
<I>mpirun</I>.

This option is mutually exclusive with 
<I>-w</I>.

<DT><B>-nx</B>

<DD>
Do not automatically export LAM_MPI_*, LAM_IMPI_*, or IMPI_*
environment variables to the remote nodes.
<DT><B>-O</B>

<DD>
Multicomputer is homogeneous.  Do no data conversion when passing
messages.  THIS FLAG IS NOW OBSOLETE.
<DT><B>-pty</B>

<DD>
Enable pseudo-tty support.  Among other things, this enabled
line-buffered output (which is probably what you want).  This is the
default.  Mutually exclusive with -npty.
<DT><B>-s &lt;node&gt;</B>

<DD>
Load the program from this node.  This option is not valid on the
command line if an application schema is specified.
<DT><B>-sigs</B>

<DD>
Have LAM catch signals in the user process.  This options is mutually
exclusive with 
<I>-nsigs</I>.

<DT><B>-ssi &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;</B>

<DD>
Send arguments to various SSI modules.  See the &quot;SSI&quot; section, below.
<DT><B>-t, -ton</B>

<DD>
Enable execution trace generation for all processes.  Trace generation
will proceed with no further action.  These options are mutually
exclusive with 
<I>-toff</I>.

<DT><B>-toff</B>

<DD>
Enable execution trace generation for all processes.  Trace generation
for message passing traffic will begin after processes collectively
call <A HREF="../man2/MPIL_Trace_on.2.php">MPIL_Trace_on</A>(2).  Note that trace generation for datatypes and
communicators
<I>will</I>

proceed regardless of whether trace generation is enabled for messages
or not.  This option is mutually exclusive with
<I>-t </I>

and 
<I>-ton</I>.

<DT><B>-tv</B>

<DD>
Launch processes under the TotalView Debugger.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Be verbose; report on important steps as they are done.
<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
Wait for all applications to exit before 
<I>mpirun</I>

exits.
<DT><B>-wd &lt;dir&gt;</B>

<DD>
Change to the directory &lt;dir&gt; before the user's program executes.
Note that if the 
<I>-wd </I>

option appears both on the command line and in an application schema,
the schema will take precendence over the command line.  This option
is mutually exclusive with
<I>-D</I>.

<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Export the specified environment variables to the remote nodes before
executing the program.  Existing environment variables can be
specified (see the Examples section, below), or new variable names
specified with corresponding values.  The parser for the 
<I>-x </I>

option is not very sophisticated; it does not even understand quoted
values.  Users are advised to set variables in the environment, and
then use
<I>-x </I>

to export (not define) them.
<DT><B>-sa</B>

<DD>
Display the exit status of all MPI processes irrespecive of whether
they fail or run successfully. 
<DT><B>-sf</B>

<DD>
Display the exit status of all processes only if one of them fails.
<DT><B>-p &lt;prefix_str&gt;</B>

<DD>
Prefixes each process status line displayed by [-sa] and [-sf] by the
&lt;prefix_str&gt;.  
<DT><B>&lt;where&gt;</B>

<DD>
A set of node and/or CPU identifiers indicating where to start 
<B>&lt;program&gt;</B>.

See <A HREF="../man5/bhost.5.php">bhost</A>(5) for a description of the node and CPU identifiers.  
<I>mpirun</I>

will schedule adjoining ranks in 
<I>MPI_COMM_WORLD </I>

on the same node when CPU identifiers are used.  For example, if LAM
was booted with a CPU count of 4 on n0 and a CPU count of 2 on n1 and
<B>&lt;where&gt;</B>

is C, ranks 0 through 3 will be placed on n0, and ranks 4 and 5 will
be placed on n1.
<DT><B>&lt;args&gt;</B>

<DD>
Pass these runtime arguments to every new process.  These must always
be the last arguments to
<I>mpirun</I>.

This option is not valid on the command line if an application schema
is specified.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

One invocation of
<I>mpirun</I>

starts an MPI application running under LAM.
If the application is simply SPMD, the application can be specified on the
<I>mpirun</I>

command line.
If the application is MIMD, comprising multiple programs, an application
schema is required in a separate file.
See <A HREF="../man5/appschema.5.php">appschema</A>(5) for a description of the application schema syntax,
but it essentially contains multiple
<I>mpirun</I>

command lines, less the command name itself.  The ability to specify
different options for different instantiations of a program is another
reason to use an application schema.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Location Nomenclature</H3>

As described above, 
<I>mpirun</I>

can specify arbitrary locations in the current LAM universe.
Locations can be specified either by CPU or by node (noted by the
&quot;&lt;where&gt;&quot; in the SYNTAX section, above).  Note that LAM does not bind
processes to CPUs -- specifying a location &quot;by CPU&quot; is really a
convenience mechanism for SMPs that ultimately maps down to a specific
node.
<P>

Note that LAM effectively numbers MPI_COMM_WORLD ranks from
left-to-right in the &lt;where&gt;, regardless of which nomenclature is
used.  This can be important because typical MPI programs tend to
communicate more with their immediate neighbors (i.e., myrank +/- X)
than distant neighbors.  When neighbors end up on the same node, the
shmem RPIs can be used for communication rather than the network RPIs,
which can result in faster MPI performance.
<P>

Specifying locations by node will launch one copy of an executable per
specified node.  Using a capitol &quot;N&quot; tells LAM to use all available
nodes that were lambooted (see <A HREF="../man1/lamboot.1.php">lamboot</A>(1)).  Ranges of specific nodes
can also be specified in the form &quot;nR[,R]*&quot;, where R specifies either
a single node number or a valid range of node numbers in the range of
[0, num_nodes).  For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun N a.out<DD>
Runs one copy of the the executable
<I>a.out</I>

on all available nodes in the LAM universe.  MPI_COMM_WORLD rank 0
will be on n0, rank 1 will be on n1, etc.
<DT>mpirun n0-3 a.out<DD>
Runs one copy of the the executable
<I>a.out</I>

on nodes 0 through 3.  MPI_COMM_WORLD rank 0 will be on n0, rank 1
will be on n1, etc.
<DT>mpirun n0-3,8-11,15 a.out<DD>
Runs one copy of the the executable
<I>a.out</I>

on nodes 0 through 3, 8 through 11, and 15.  MPI_COMM_WORLD ranks will
be ordered as follows: (0, n0), (1, n1), (2, n2), (3, n3), (4, n8),
(5, n9), (6, n10), (7, n11), (8, n15).
</DL>
<P>

Specifying by CPU is the preferred method of launching MPI jobs.  The
intent is that the boot schema used with <A HREF="../man1/lamboot.1.php">lamboot</A>(1) will indicate how
many CPUs are available on each node, and then a single, simple 
<I>mpirun</I>

command can be used to launch across all of them.  As noted above,
specifying CPUs does not actually bind processes to CPUs -- it is only
a convenience mechanism for launching on SMPs.  Otherwise, the by-CPU
nodation is the same as the by-node notation, except that &quot;C&quot; and &quot;c&quot;
are used instead of &quot;N&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.  
<P>

Assume in the following example that the LAM universe consists of four
4-way SMPs.  So c0-3 are on n0, c4-7 are on n1, c8-11 are on n2, and
13-15 are on n3.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun C a.out<DD>
Runs one copy of the the executable
<I>a.out</I>

on all available CPUs in the LAM universe.  This is typically the
simplest (and preferred) method of launching all MPI jobs (even if it
resolves to one process per node).  MPI_COMM_WORLD ranks 0-3 will be
on n0, ranks 4-7 will be on n1, ranks 8-11 will be on n2, and ranks
13-15 will be on n3.
<DT>mpirun c0-3 a.out<DD>
Runs one copy of the the executable
<I>a.out</I>

on CPUs 0 through 3.  All four ranks of MPI_COMM_WORLD will be on
MPI_COMM_WORLD.
<DT>mpirun c0-3,8-11,15 a.out<DD>
Runs one copy of the the executable
<I>a.out</I>

on CPUs 0 through 3, 8 through 11, and 15.  MPI_COMM_WORLD ranks 0-3
will be on n0, 4-7 will be on n2, and 8 will be on n3.
</DL>
<P>

The reason that the by-CPU nomenclature is preferred over the by-node
nomenclature is best shown through example.  Consider trying to run
the first CPU example (with the same MPI_COMM_WORLD mapping) with the
by-node nomenclature -- run one copy of 
<I>a.out</I>

for every available CPU, and maximize the number of local neighbors to
potentially maximize MPI performance.  One solution would be to use
the following command:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun n0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3 a.out<DD>
</DL>
<P>

This 
<I>works</I>,

but is definitely klunky to type.  It is typically easier to use the
by-CPU notation.  One might think that the following is equivalent:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun N -np 16 a.out<DD>
</DL>
<P>

This is 
<I>not</I>

equivalent because the MPI_COMM_WORLD rank mappings will be assigned
by node rather than by CPU.  Hence rank 0 will be on n0, rank 1 will
be on n1, etc.  Note that the following, however,
<I>is</I>

equivalent, because LAM interprets lack of a &lt;where&gt; as &quot;C&quot;:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun -np 16 a.out<DD>
</DL>
<P>

However, a &quot;C&quot; can tend to be more convenient, especially for
batch-queuing scripts because the exact number of processes may vary
between queue submissions.  Since the batch system will determine the
final number of CPUs available, having a generic script that
effectively says &quot;run on everything you gave me&quot; may lead to more
portable / re-usable scripts.
<P>

Finally, it should be noted that specifying multiple &lt;where&gt; clauses
are perfectly acceptable.  As such, mixing of the by-node and by-CPU
syntax is also valid, albiet typically not useful.  For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun C N a.out<DD>
</DL>
<P>

However, in some cases, specifying multiple &lt;where&gt; clauses can be
useful.  Consider a parallel application where MPI_COMM_WORLD rank 0
will be a &quot;manager&quot; and therefore consume very few CPU cycles because
it is usually waiting for &quot;worker&quot; processes to return results.
Hence, it is probably desirable to run one &quot;worker&quot; process on all
available CPUs, and run one extra process that will be the &quot;manager&quot;:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun c0 C manager-worker-program<DD>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Application Schema or Executable Program?</H3>

To distinguish the two different forms,
<I>mpirun</I>

looks on the command line for &lt;where&gt; or the <I>-c</I> option.  If
neither is specified, then the file named on the command line is
assumed to be an application schema.  If either one or both are
specified, then the file is assumed to be an executable program.  If
&lt;where&gt; and <I>-c</I> both are specified, then copies of the program
are started on the specified nodes/CPUs according to an internal LAM
scheduling policy.  Specifying just one node effectively forces LAM to
run all copies of the program in one place.  If <I>-c</I> is given, but
not &lt;where&gt;, then all available CPUs on all LAM nodes are used.  If
&lt;where&gt; is given, but not <I>-c</I>, then one copy of the program is
run on each node.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Program Transfer</H3>

By default, LAM searches for executable programs on the target node
where a particular instantiation will run.  If the file system is not
shared, the target nodes are homogeneous, and the program is
frequently recompiled, it can be convenient to have LAM transfer the
program from a source node (usually the local node) to each target
node.  The <I>-s</I> option specifies this behavior and identifies the
single source node.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Locating Files</H3>

LAM looks for an executable program by searching the directories in
the user's PATH environment variable as defined on the source node(s).
This behavior is consistent with logging into the source node and
executing the program from the shell.  On remote nodes, the &quot;.&quot; path
is the home directory.
<P>

LAM looks for an application schema in three directories: the local
directory, the value of the LAMAPPLDIR environment variable, and
laminstalldir/boot, where &quot;laminstalldir&quot; is the directory where
LAM/MPI was installed.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Standard I/O</H3>

LAM directs UNIX standard input to /dev/null on all remote nodes.  On
the local node that invoked
<I>mpirun</I>,

standard input is inherited from
<I>mpirun</I>.

The default is what used to be the -w option to prevent conflicting
access to the terminal.
<P>

LAM directs UNIX standard output and error to the LAM daemon on all
remote nodes.  LAM ships all captured output/error to the node that
invoked
<I>mpirun</I>

and prints it on the standard output/error of
<I>mpirun</I>.

Local processes inherit the standard output/error of
<I>mpirun</I>

and transfer to it directly.
<P>

Thus it is possible to redirect standard I/O for LAM applications by
using the typical shell redirection procedure on
<I>mpirun</I>.

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
% mpirun C my_app &lt; my_input &gt; my_output
</DL>

<P>

Note that in this example
<I>only</I>

the local node (i.e., the node where mpirun was invoked from) will
receive the stream from my_input on stdin.  The stdin on all the other
nodes will be tied to /dev/null.  However, the stdout from all nodes
will be collected into the my_output file.
<P>

The
<I>-f</I>

option avoids all the setup required to support standard I/O described
above.  Remote processes are completely directed to /dev/null and
local processes inherit file descriptors from <A HREF="../man1/lamboot.1.php">lamboot</A>(1).
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Pseudo-tty support</H3>

The 
<I>-pty</I>

option enabled pseudo-tty support for process output (it is also
enabled by default).  This allows, among other things, for line
buffered output from remote nodes (which is probably what you want).
This option can be disabled with the
<I>-npty</I>

switch.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Process Termination / Signal Handling</H3>

During the run of an MPI application, if any rank dies abnormally
(either exiting before invoking
<I>MPI_FINALIZE</I>,

or dying as the result of a signal), 
<I>mpirun</I>

will print out an error message and kill the rest of the MPI
application.
<P>

By default, LAM/MPI only installs a signal handler for one signal in
user programs (SIGUSR2 by default, but this can be overridden when LAM
is configured and built).  Therefore, it is safe for users to install
their own signal handlers in LAM/MPI programs (LAM notices
death-by-signal cases by examining the process' return status provided
by the operating system).  
<P>

User signal handlers should probably avoid trying to cleanup MPI state
-- LAM is neither thread-safe nor async-signal-safe.  For example, if
a seg fault occurs in
<I>MPI_SEND</I>

(perhaps because a bad buffer was passed in) and a user signal handler
is invoked, if this user handler attempts to invoke
<I>MPI_FINALIZE</I>,

Bad Things could happen since LAM/MPI was already &quot;in&quot; MPI when the
error occurred.  Since
<I>mpirun</I>

will notice that the process died due to a signal, it is probably not
necessary (and safest) for the user to only clean up non-MPI state.
<P>

If the 
<I>-sigs</I>

option is used with 
<I>mpirun</I>,

LAM/MPI will install several signal handlers to locally on each rank
to catch signals, print out error messages, and kill the rest of the
MPI application.  This is somewhat redundant behavior since this is
now all handled by
<I>mpirun</I>,

but it has been left for backwards compatability.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Process Exit Statuses</H3>

The
<I>-sa</I>,

&nbsp;
<I>-sf</I>,

and
<I>-p</I>

parameters can be used to display the exist statuses of the individual
MPI processes as they terminate.  
<I>-sa </I>

forces the exit statuses to be displayed for all processes;
<I>-sf</I>

only displays the exist statuses if at least one process terminates
either by a signal or a non-zero exit status (note that exiting before
invoking
<I>MPI_FINALIZE</I>

will cause a non-zero exit status).
<P>

The status of each process is printed out, one per line, in the
following format:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
prefix_string node pid killed status
</DL>

<P>

If
<I>killed</I>

is 1, then
<I>status</I>

is the signal number.  If
<I>killed</I>

is 0, then
<I>status</I>

is the exit status of the process.
<P>

The default 
<I>prefix_string</I>

is &quot;mpirun:&quot;, but the
<I>-p</I>

option can be used override this string.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Current Working Directory</H3>

The default behavior of mpirun has changed with respect to the
directory that processes will be started in.
<P>

The 
<I>-wd </I>

option to mpirun allows the user to change to an arbitrary directory
before their program is invoked.  It can also be used in application
schema files to specify working directories on specific nodes and/or
for specific applications.
<P>

If the 
<I>-wd</I>

option appears both in a schema file and on the command line, the
schema file directory will override the command line value.
<P>

The
<I>-D</I>

option will change the current working directory to the directory
where the executable resides.  It cannot be used in application schema
files.
<I>-wd</I>

is mutually exclusive with 
<I>-D</I>.

<P>

If neither 
<I>-wd </I>

nor 
<I>-D</I>

are specified, the local node will send the directory name where
mpirun was invoked from to each of the remote nodes.  The remote nodes
will then try to change to that directory.  If they fail (e.g., if the
directory does not exists on that node), they will start with from the
user's home directory.
<P>

All directory changing occurs before the user's program is invoked; it
does not wait until 
<I>MPI_INIT </I>

is called.  
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Process Environment</H3>

Processes in the MPI application inherit their environment from the
LAM daemon upon the node on which they are running.  The environment
of a LAM daemon is fixed upon booting of the LAM with <A HREF="../man1/lamboot.1.php">lamboot</A>(1) and
is typically inherited from the user's shell.  On the origin node,
this will be the shell from which <A HREF="../man1/lamboot.1.php">lamboot</A>(1) was invoked; on remote
nodes, the exact environment is determined by the boot SSI module used
by <A HREF="../man1/lamboot.1.php">lamboot</A>(1).  The rsh boot module, for example, uses either rsh/ssh
to launch the LAM daemon on remote nodes, and typically executes one
or more of the user's shell-setup files before launching the LAM
daemon.  When running dynamically linked applications which require
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to be set, care must be taken
to ensure that it is correctly set when booting the LAM.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Exported Environment Variables</H3>

All environment variables that are named in the form LAM_MPI_*,
LAM_IMPI_*, or IMPI_* will automatically be exported to new processes
on the local and remote nodes.  This exporting may be inhibited with
the
<I>-nx</I>

option.
<P>

Additionally, the 
<I>-x</I>

option to 
<I>mpirun</I>

can be used to export specific environment variables to the new
processes.  While the syntax of the 
<I>-x </I>

option allows the definition of new variables, note that the parser
for this option is currently not very sophisticated - it does not even
understand quoted values.  Users are advised to set variables in the
environment and use 
<I>-x </I>

to export them; not to define them.

<H3>Trace Generation</H3>

Two switches control trace generation from processes running under LAM
and both must be in the on position for traces to actually be
generated.  The first switch is controlled by
<I>mpirun</I>

and the second switch is initially set by
<I>mpirun</I>

but can be toggled at runtime with <A HREF="../man2/MPIL_Trace_on.2.php">MPIL_Trace_on</A>(2) and
<A HREF="../man2/MPIL_Trace_off.2.php">MPIL_Trace_off</A>(2).  The <I>-t</I> (<I>-ton</I> is equivalent) and
<I>-toff</I> options all turn on the first switch.  Otherwise the first
switch is off and calls to <A HREF="../man2/MPIL_Trace_on.2.php">MPIL_Trace_on</A>(2) in the application program
are ineffective.  The <I>-t</I> option also turns on the second switch.
The <I>-toff</I> option turns off the second switch.  See
<A HREF="../man2/MPIL_Trace_on.2.php">MPIL_Trace_on</A>(2) and <A HREF="../man1/lamtrace.1.php">lamtrace</A>(1) for more details.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>MPI Data Conversion</H3>

LAM's MPI library converts MPI messages from local representation to
LAM representation upon sending them and then back to local
representation upon receiving them.  If the case of a LAM consisting
of a homogeneous network of machines where the local representation
differs from the LAM representation this can result in unnecessary
conversions.

The <I>-O</I> switch used to be necessary to indicate to LAM whether
the mulitcomputer was homogeneous or not.  LAM now automatically
determines whether a given MPI job is homogeneous or not.  The
<I>-O</I>

flag will silently be accepted for backwards compatability, but it is
ignored.
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>SSI (System Services Interface)</H3>

The
<I>-ssi</I>

switch allows the passing of parameters to various SSI modules.  LAM's
SSI modules are described in detail in <A HREF="../man7/lamssi.7.php">lamssi</A>(7).  SSI modules have
direct impact on MPI programs because they allow tunable parameters to
be set at run time (such as which RPI communication device driver to
use, what parameters to pass to that RPI, etc.).
<P>

The 
<I>-ssi</I>

switch takes two arguments:
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

and 
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>.

The
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

argument generally specifies which SSI module will receive the value.
For example, the
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

&quot;rpi&quot; is used to select which RPI to be used for transporting MPI
messages.  The
<I>&lt;value&gt; </I>

argument is the value that is passed.  For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun -ssi rpi lamd N foo<DD>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;lamd&quot; RPI and to run a single copy of &quot;foo&quot; on
every node.
<DT>mpirun -ssi rpi tcp N foo<DD>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;tcp&quot; RPI.
<DT>mpirun -ssi rpi sysv N foo<DD>
Tells LAM to use the &quot;sysv&quot; RPI.
</DL>
<P>

And so on.  LAM's RPI SSI modules are described in <A HREF="../man7/lamssi_rpi.7.php">lamssi_rpi</A>(7).
<P>

The 
<I>-ssi</I>

switch can be used multiple times to specify different
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

and/or
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>

arguments.  If the same
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

is specified more than once, the
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>s

are concatenated with a comma (&quot;,&quot;) separating them.
<P>

Note that the 
<I>-ssi</I>

switch is simply a shortcut for setting environment variables.  The
same effect may be accomplished by setting corresponding environment
variables before running
<I>mpirun</I>.

The form of the environment variables that LAM sets are:
<I>LAM_MPI_SSI_&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</I>.

<P>

Note that the
<I>-ssi</I>

switch overrides any previously set environment variables.  Also note
that unknown
<I>&lt;key&gt;</I>

arguments are still set as environment variable -- they are not
checked (by
<I>mpirun</I>)

for correctness.  Illegal or incorrect 
<I>&lt;value&gt;</I>

arguments may or may not be reported -- it depends on the specific SSI
module.
<P>

The
<I>-ssi</I>

switch obsoletes the old
<I>-c2c</I>

and 
<I>-lamd</I>

switches.  These switches used to be relevant because LAM could only
have two RPI's available at a time: the lamd RPI and one of the C2C
RPIs.  This is no longer true -- all RPI's are now available and
choosable at run-time.  Selecting the lamd RPI is shown in the
examples above.  
The
<I>-c2c</I>

switch has no direct translation since &quot;C2C&quot; used to refer to all
other RPI's that were not the lamd RPI.  As such, 
<I>-ssi rpi &lt;value&gt;</I>

must be used to select the specific desired RPI (whether it is &quot;lamd&quot;
or one of the other RPI's).
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Guaranteed Envelope Resources</H3>

By default, LAM will guarantee a minimum amount of message envelope
buffering to each MPI process pair and will impede or report an error
to a process that attempts to overflow this system resource.  This
robustness and debugging feature is implemented in a machine specific
manner when direct communication is used.  For normal LAM
communication via the LAM daemon, a protocol is used.  The <I>-nger</I>
option disables GER and the measures taken to support it.  The minimum
GER is configured by the system administrator when LAM is installed.
See <A HREF="../man7/MPI.7.php">MPI</A>(7) for more details.
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun N prog1<DD>
Load and execute prog1 on all nodes.  Search the user's $PATH for the
executable file on each node.
<DT>mpirun -c 8 prog1<DD>
Run 8 copies of prog1 wherever LAM wants to run them.
<DT>mpirun n8-10 -v -nw -s n3 prog1 -q<DD>
Load and execute prog1 on nodes 8, 9, and 10.  Search for prog1 on
node 3 and transfer it to the three target nodes.  Report as each
process is created.  Give &quot;-q&quot; as a command line to each new process.
Do not wait for the processes to complete before exiting
<I>mpirun</I>.

<DT>mpirun -v myapp<DD>
Parse the application schema, myapp, and start all processes specified
in it.  Report as each process is created.
<DT>mpirun -npty -wd /work/output -x DISPLAY C my_application<DD>
<P>
Start one copy of &quot;my_application&quot; on each available CPU.  The number
of available CPUs on each node was previously specified when LAM was
booted with <A HREF="../man1/lamboot.1.php">lamboot</A>(1).  As noted above,
<I>mpirun</I>

will schedule adjoining rank in 
<I>MPI_COMM_WORLD </I>

on the same node where possible.  For example, if n0 has a CPU count
of 8, and n1 has a CPU count of 4,
<I>mpirun</I>

will place 
<I>MPI_COMM_WORLD </I>

ranks 0 through 7 on n0, and 8 through 11 on n1.  This tends to
maximize on-node communication for many parallel applications; when
used in conjunction with the multi-protocol network/shared memory RPIs
in LAM (see the RELEASE_NOTES and INSTALL files with the LAM
distribution), overall communication performance can be quite good.
Also disable pseudo-tty support, change directory to /work/output, and
export the DISPLAY variable to the new processes (perhaps
my_application will invoke an X application such as xv to display
output).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>mpirun: Exec format error<DD>
A non-ASCII character was detected in the application schema.
This is usually a command line usage error where
<I>mpirun</I>

is expecting an application schema and an executable file was given.
<DT>mpirun: syntax error in application schema, line XXX<DD>
The application schema cannot be parsed because of a usage or syntax error
on the given line in the file.
<DT>&lt;filename&gt;: No such file or directory<DD>
This error can occur in two cases.  Either the named file cannot be
located or it has been found but the user does not have sufficient
permissions to execute the program or read the application schema.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

<I>mpirun</I>

returns 0 if all ranks started by
<I>mpirun</I>

exit after calling MPI_FINALIZE.  A non-zero value is returned if an 
internal error occurred in mpirun, or one or more ranks exited before 
calling MPI_FINALIZE.  If an internal error occurred in mpirun, the 
corresponding error code is returned.  In the event that one or more ranks 
exit before calling MPI_FINALIZE, the return value of the rank of the 
process that
<I>mpirun</I>

first notices died before calling MPI_FINALIZE will be returned.  Note
that, in general, this will be the first rank that died but is not
guaranteed to be so.
<P>

However, note that if the 
<I>-nw </I>

switch is used, the return value from mpirun does not indicate the exit status
of the ranks.
