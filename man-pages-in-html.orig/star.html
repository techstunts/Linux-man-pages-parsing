<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Star</B>

is a very fast
<B><A HREF="../man1/tar.1.php">tar</A></B>(1)

like tape archiver with improved functionality.
<P>

<B>Star</B>

archives and extracts multiple files to and from a single file
called a 
<I>tarfile. </I>

A 
<I>tarfile</I>

is usually a magnetic tape, but it can be any file.
In all cases, appearance of a directory name refers to the files and 
(recursively) subdirectories of that directory.
<P>

<B>Star's</B>

actions are controlled by the mandatory command flags from the 
list below.
The way 
<B>star </B>

acts may be modified by additional options. 
<P>

Note that unpacking tar archives may be a security risk because 
<B>star</B>

may overwrite existing files.
See SECURITY NOTES for more information.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FEATURES</H2>

<B>Star</B>

includes the first free implementation of
<B>POSIX.1-2001</B>

extended
<B>tar</B>

headers. The extended 
<B>tar</B>

headers define a new standard way
for going beyond the limitations of the historic 
<B>tar</B>

format.
They allow (among others) to archive all UNIX time stamps in sub-second
resolution, files of arbitrary size and filenames without length limitation
using
<B>UNICODE UTF-8</B>

coding for best exchange compatibility.
<P>

<B>Star</B>

by default uses a fifo to optimize data flow from/to tape. This results in 
a normally streaming tape during the whole backup.
See 
<B>-fifo </B>

and
<B>fs=</B>

option to get information on how to find the best fifo size.
<P>

<B>Star </B>

includes a pattern matcher to control the list of files to be 
processed. This gives a convenient interface for archiving and 
restoring complex lists of files. In conjunction with the 
<B>-w </B>

flag it is easy to merge a
<B>tar</B>

archive into an existing file tree. See also 
<B>-U </B>

option.
In create mode use the 
<B>pat=</B>

option to specify either select or exclude patterns (depending on
the 
<B>-V</B>

flag). In extract or list mode 
all file type arguments are interpreted as select patterns while
the patterns specified with the
<B>pat=</B>

option may be used as select or exclude patterns (depending on
the 
<B>-V</B>

flag).
Have a look at the description of the
<B>-C</B>

option to learn how fetch files from a list of directories
(in create mode) or to distribute files to a list of directories
(in extract mode).
<P>

<B>Star </B>

includes a sophisticated diff command. Several diff options 
allow user tailorable functionality. 
<B>Star </B>

won't show you differences you are not interested in.
Check the 
<B>diffopts=</B>

option for more details.
<P>

<B>Star </B>

has no limitation on filename length. Pathnames and linknames up to
<I>PATH_MAX</I>

(1023&nbsp;bytes with old OS versions and 4095&nbsp;bytes with POSIX.1-2001)
may be archived. Later versions may be able to deal with 
longer pathnames.
<P>

<B>Star </B>

deals with all 3 times, available for files on UNIX systems if the
archive format is either chosen from the star specific formats or
is a format that uses POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
This is either done in second resolution by using a star specific
POSIX.1-1988 compatible extension or in sub second resolution by 
using POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
<B>Star </B>

is able to store and restore all 3 times (mtime, atime and even 
ctime). On Solaris 2.x systems, 
<B>star </B>

is able to do backups without changing any of the 3 the times.
<P>

If used with the 
<B>H=</B><I>ustar</I>

option, or if called as
<B>ustar</B>

or
<B>tar</B>

while the
<B>H=</B>headertype

option is not used,
<B>star</B>

is 100% POSIX compliant.
<P>

<B>Star's </B>

default format (if called as
<B>star</B>)

is 
<I>xstar</I>

and is as posix compliant as possible. Enhancements to the standard that 
prevent correct extraction of single files when using a different
<B>tar </B>

implementation that is only POSIX.1-1988 compliant may occur,
but they only affect single files with a pathname that is longer than 100+130 chars 
or when archiving sparse files with the 
<B>-sparse</B>

option in effect.
All other files will extract correctly.
See the description for the
<B>H=</B><I>headertype</I>

option below for more information on archive formats and possible archive
interchange problems.
<P>

<B>Star </B>

makes it easy to repair corrupted filesystems. After a fsck -y 
has been run on the filesystem, 
<B>star </B>

is able to restore only 
the missing files automatically. 
Use then 
<I>star -diff</I>

to check for differences (see EXAMPLES for more information).
<P>

<B>Star </B>

automatically recognizes the type of the archive.
<B>Star </B>

therefore is able to handle features and properties of different 
archive types in their native mode,
if it knows about the peculiarities of the archive type.
See the 
<B>H=</B>headertype

option for more details.
To be able to do this, 
<B>star</B>

adds hidden fingerprints to the archive header that allows to recognise
all star specific archive formats. The GNU tar format is recognised by
the way it deviates from the standard.
<P>

<B>Star </B>

automatically recognizes and handles byte swapped archives. There is no 
option to manually control byte swapping.
<P>

<B>Star</B>

automatically recognizes and handles compressed archives inside plain
files.
<P>

<B>Star</B>

is able to archive and restore 
<B>Access Control Lists</B>

for files using POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND</H2>

<P>

In native mode, 
<B>star</B>

is compatible to the command line syntax of a typical POSIX command
and for this reason expects 
<I>commands</I>

and
<I>options</I>

to start with a single dash (-). In this case, commands
and options may be specified separately, all boolean or increment type
options may be specified either separately or combined.
For compatibility with GNU programs, long options may alternatively
start with a double dash.
In compatibility mode to POSIX
<B>tar</B>,

<B>star</B>

expects commands and options to appear as one single string that does not start
with a dash.
In POSIX tar compatibilitx mode,
additional non POSIX options may be specified but must appear after the
POSIX options and their args and need to start with a dash.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Create a new
<I>tarfile</I>

and write named files into it.
Writing starts at the beginning of
<I>tarfile.</I>

See -v option for information on how to increase verbosity while the 
archive is written.
<DT><B>-copy</B>

<DD>
Copy named files to the target directory which is the last file type argument.
The target directory must exist.
The shorthand
<B>-cx</B>

instead of
<B>-copy</B>

is not allowed because this could be a result of a typo.
<P>
If the option
<B>-diff</B>

has been specified in addition,
<B>star</B>

performs a one pass directory tree compare instead of copying files.
The shorthand
<B>-c -diff</B>

instead of
<B>-copy -diff</B>

is also allowed.
<P>
On operating systems with slow file I/O (such as Linux), it may help
to use
<B>-no-fsync</B>

in addition, but then
<B>star</B>

is unable to detect all error conditions; so use with care.
<P>
If the option
<B>-t</B>

has been specified in addition, the last file type argument is not a 
target directory and 
<B>star</B>

is performing a one pass listing instead of copying files.
This makes sense as the listing from
<B>star</B>

may be better readable than the output from
<B>ls -lR</B>.

The shorthand
<B>-c -t</B>

or
<B>-ct</B>

instead of
<B>-copy -t</B>

is also allowed.
<P>
The job is by default done in the best archive mode.
This implies that it defaults to 
<B>H=exustar -dump</B>.

When in
<B>-copy</B>

mode, 
<B>star</B>

forks into two processes and data exchange is done via the shared memory from the FIFO.
This gives the best possible performance.
Without FIFO, the 
<B>-copy</B>

mode will not work.
<P>
The
<B>list=</B>

option, patterns and substitutions apply only to the create side of the copy command.
<DT><B>-diff</B>

<DD>
Compare the content and the attributes of the files from the archive in
<I>tarfile</I>

to the filesystem.
This may also be used to compare two file trees in the filesystem.
If you use a set of
<I>diffopts</I>

that fits your needs, it will give
- in many cases - a more readable output than diff -r.
If you use
<B>star's</B>

dump extensions for the tar archive, the 
<B>-diff</B>

option allows to find even if the directory in the file tree
contains more files than the archive. This way, it is possible to
compare all properties of two file trees in one run.
See 
<I>diffopts </I>

for more details.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
No extraction. Show what 
<B>star </B>

would do, in case the
<B>-x</B>

command had been specified.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Replace files in a
<I>tarfile.</I>

The named files are written to the end of
<I>tarfile.</I>

This implies that later,
the appropriate files will be found more than once on the 
<I>tarfile.</I>

<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Table of contents.
List the contents of the
<I>tarfile.</I>

If the -v flag is used, the listing is similar to the format of ls -l output.
With this option, the flags
<B>-a</B>,

<B>-atime</B>

and
<B>-ctime</B>

have a different meaning if the archive is in 
<B>star</B>,

<B>xstar</B>,

<B>xustar</B>,

<B>exustar</B>,

or
<B>pax </B>

format.
The option
<B>-a</B>

or
<B>-atime</B>

lists the access time instead of the modification time, the option
<B>-ctime</B>

lists the file creation time instead of the modification time.
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>
Update a
<I>tarfile.</I>

The named files are written to the end of
<I>tarfile</I>

if they are not already there or if the files are newer than the files
of the same name found in the archive.
The -r and -u command only work if the
<B>tar</B>

archives is a regular file or
if the
<B>tar</B>

archive is an unblocked tape that may backspace.
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Extract the named files from the
<I>tarfile.</I>

If no filename argument or pattern is specified, the entire content of the
<I>tarfile</I>

is restored.
If the -U flag is not used, 
<B>star </B>

extracts no file which is older than the corresponding file on disk.
<P>
On operating systems with slow file I/O (such as Linux), it may help
to use
<B>-no-fsync</B>

in addition, but then
<B>star</B>

is unable to detect all error conditions; so use with care.
</DL>
<P>

Except for the shorthands documented above,
exactly one of the commands above must be specified.
<P>

If one or more patterns or substitution commands have been specified,
they apply to any of the command listed above.
In copy mode, all patterns and substitute commands apply to the create side.
<P>

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-help</B>

<DD>
Print a summary of the most important options for
<B><A HREF="../man1/star.1.php">star</A></B>(1).

<DT><B>-xhelp</B>

<DD>
Print a summary of the less important options for
<B><A HREF="../man1/star.1.php">star</A></B>(1).

<DT><B>-/</B>

<DD>
Don't strip leading slashes from file names when extracting an archive.
Tar archives containing absolute pathnames are usually a bad idea. 
With other 
<B>tar </B>

implementations, 
they may possibly never be extracted without clobbering existing files. 
<B>Star </B>

for that reason, by default strips leading slashes from filenames 
when in extract mode.
As it may be impossible to create an archive where leading slashes have
been stripped while retaining correct path names, 
<B>star</B>

does not strip leading slashes in create mode.
<P>
See SECURITY NOTES for more information.
<DT><B>-..</B>

<DD>
Don't skip files that contain /../ in the name. Tar archives containing
names with /../ could be used to compromise the system. If they are
unpacked together with a lot of other files, this would in most cases not
even be noticed. For this reason, 
<B>star</B>

by default does not extract files that contain /../ in the name if
<B>star</B>

is not in interactive mode (see
<B>-w</B>

option).
<P>
See SECURITY NOTES for more information.
<DT><B>-acl</B>

<DD>
Handle 
<B>Access Control List</B>

(ACL) information in create and extract mode.
If
<B>-acl</B>

has been specified,
<B>star </B>

is in create mode and the header type is 
<B>exustar</B>, <B>star</B>

will add ACL information to the archive using POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
If
<B>-acl</B>

has been specified and
<B>star </B>

is in extract mode,
<B>star</B>

will try to restore ACL information. If there is no ACL information for
one or all files in the archive,
<B>star</B>

will clear the ACL information for the specific file.
Note that if
<B>-acl</B>

has not been specified,
<B>star</B>

will not handle ACL information at all and files may inherit ACL
information from the parent directories.
If the 
<B>-acl</B>

option has been specified,
<B>star</B>

assumes that the
<B>-p</B>

option has been specified too.
<DT><B>-ask_remove</B>

<DD>
obsoleted by -ask-remove
<DT><B>-ask-remove</B>

<DD>
Ask to remove non writable files on extraction.
By default, 
<B>star</B>

will not overwrite files that are read only.
If this option is in effect, 
<B>star</B>

will ask whether it should remove these files to allow the extraction of a file
in the following way:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>remove '</B><I>filename</I><B>' ? Y(es)/N(o) :</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>-atime</B>, <B>-a</B>

<DD>
Reset access time of files after storing them to 
<I>tarfile.</I>

On Solaris 2.x, (if invoked by root) 
<B>star </B>

uses the 
<I>_FIOSATIME </I>

ioctl to do this. This enables 
<B>star </B>

not to trash the 
<I>ctime</I>

while resetting the
<I>atime</I>

of the files.
If the
<B>-atime</B>

option is used in conjunction with the list command, 
<B>star </B>

lists access time instead of modification time. (This works only in 
conjunction with the
<B>star</B>,

<B>xstar</B>,

<B>xustar</B>,

<B>exustar</B>,

and with the 
<B>pax </B>

format.)
Another option to retain the access time for the the files that
are going to be archives is to readonly mount a 
<B>UFS snapshot</B>

and to archive files from the mount point of the UFS snapshot.
<DT><B>-B</B>

<DD>
Force 
<B>star</B>

to perform multiple reads (if necessary) to fill a block.
This option exists so that 
<B>star </B>

can work across the Ethernet, since pipes and sockets return partial blocks 
even when more data is coming.
If 
<B>star</B>

uses 
<I>stdin</I>

as archive file, 
<B>star</B>

behaves as if it has been called with the 
<B>-B</B>

option.
For this reason, the option -B in practice is rarely needed.
<DT><B>-block-number</B>

<DD>
Print the archive block number (archive offset / 512) at the beginning of
each line when in verbose mode. This allows to write backup scripts
that archive the offsets for files and that use
<P>
<B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>mt fsr</B><I> blockno</I>

<P>
to skip to the tape block number of interest in a fast way<BR>
if a single file needs to be restored.
<DT><B>blocks=</B>#, <B>b=</B>#

<DD>
Set the blocking factor of the 
<I>tarfile</I>

to #&nbsp;times 512&nbsp;bytes (unless a different multiplication factor has 
been specified - see 
<B>bs=</B>

option for posible multiplication factors).
Changing the blocking factor only makes sense
when the archive is located on a real tape device or when
the archive is accessed via the remote tape protocol (see
<B>f=</B>

option below).
The default is to use a blocking factor of 20 i.e. 
10&nbsp;kBytes.
Increasing the blocksize will speed up the backup.
For portability with very old
<B>tar</B>

implementations (pre BSD&nbsp;4.2 or pre AT&amp;T&nbsp;SVR4),
blocksize should not be more than 10&nbsp;kBytes.
For POSIX.1-1988 compatibility, blocksize should be no more than 10&nbsp;kBytes.
For POSIX.1-2001 compatibility, blocksize should be no more than 32&nbsp;kBytes.
Most systems also have a hardware limitation for the blocksize, 32&nbsp;kBytes
and 63&nbsp;kBytes are common limits on many systems.
The upper limit in any case is the size of the buffer RAM in the tape drive.
Make a test if you want to make sure that the target system will handle
the intended blocksize.
If you use 
<B>star</B>

for data exchange via tape, it is a good idea to use a blocksize of 10&nbsp;kBytes
unless you are sure that the reading system will handle a larger blocksize.
If you use 
<B>star</B>

for backup purposes with recent hardware (e.g. DLT tape drives),
a blocksize of 256&nbsp;kBytes
results in sufficient speed and seems to be a good choice.
<B>Star</B>

allows block sizes up to 2 GByte if the system does not impose a smaller limit.
If you want to determine the blocking factor when reading an unknown
<B>tar</B>

archive 
on tape, specify a blocking factor that is higher than the supposed 
blocking factor of the tape. 
<B>Star </B>

then will determine the blocking factor 
by reading the first record of the tape and print a message:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>star: Blocksize = # records.</B>

</DL>
<P>

Where # is the blocking factor in multiples of 512 bytes.
The
<I>blocks=</I>

option 
and the
<I>bs=</I>

option are equivalent methods to specify the tape block size.
The 
<B>blocks= </B>

option is preferred by people who like to use an option that behaves
similar to the interface of the historic
<B><A HREF="../man1/tar.1.php">tar</A></B>(1)

implementations.
</DL>

<DT><B>bs=</B>#

<DD>
Set output block size to #.
You may use the same method as in 
<B><A HREF="../man1/dd.1.php">dd</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="../man1/sdd.1.php">sdd</A></B>(1).

The number representing the size is taken in bytes unless otherwise specified.
If a number is followed directly by the letter `.', `w', `b', `k', `m', `g',
`t', or `p',
the size is multiplied by 1, 2, 512, 1024, 1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024,
1024*1024*1024*1024 or 1024*1024*1024*1024*1024.
If the size consists of numbers separated by `x' or `*', multiplication of the 
two numbers is performed.
Thus 
<I>bs=7x8k</I>

will specify a blocksize of 56&nbsp;kBytes.
Blocksize must be a multiple of 512 bytes.
See also the description of the
<I>blocks=</I>

option for more details on blocksizes.
The option
<B>bs=</B>

is preferred by people who like to use an option that behaves
similar to the interface used by
<B><A HREF="../man1/dd.1.php">dd</A></B>(1)

and
<B><A HREF="../man1/sdd.1.php">sdd</A></B>(1).

<DT><B>-bz</B>

As both the

option are non standard, it makes sense to omit the
<B>-bz</B>

and the
<B>-z</B>

inside shell scripts if you are going to extract a compressed

<B>C=</B><I>dir</I>

option are interpreted as if they were preceded by a 
<B>-C</B><I> .</I>

option.
See EXAMPLES for more information. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>-copylinks</B>

<DD>
This option allows to copy hard/symlinks targets
rather than creating a link.
It helps to extract
<B>tar</B>

files on systems that do not implement
links (e.g. OS/2).
To extract and copy all symlinks correctly, you may need to call
<B>star</B>

twice as 
<B>star</B>

cannot copy files that appear in the archive later than a symlink
pointing to them.
<DT><B>-ctime</B>

<DD>
If used with the list command, this lists 
<I>ctime </I>

rather than 
<I>mtime</I>

if the archive format is
<B>star</B>,

<B>xstar</B>,

<B>xustar</B>,

<B>exustar</B>,

or
<B>pax</B>.

If used with the extract command and the same archive formats,
this tries to restore even the 
<I>ctime </I>

of a file by generating time storms.
You should not do this when in multi user mode because this may 
confuse programs like cron and the news system.
If used with the create command this changes the behavior of the
<I>newer=</I>

option. 
<B>Star</B>,

in this case compares the
<I>ctime</I>

of all files to the 
<I>mtime</I>

of the stamp file rather then comparing the
<I>mtimes</I>

of both files.
<DT><B>-D</B>

<DD>
Do not descend directories.
Normally, 
<B>star </B>

descends the whole tree if it encounters a directory in 
in its file parameters.
The option 
<B>-D</B>

is in effect by default if the 
<B>list=</B><I>file</I>

option is used.
If you like 
<B>star</B>

to descend directories found in the list file, use the
<B>-dodesc</B>

option (see below).
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Do not store/create directories.
Old versions of 
<B>tar </B>

such as published with the seventh edition of UNIX
are not able to deal with directories in
<B>tar</B>

archives. 
If a
<B>tar</B>

archive is generated without directories this avoids
problems with
<B>tar</B>

implementations found on SYSVr3 and earlier.
<DT><B>-debug</B>

<DD>
Print debug messages. Among other things, this gives debug messages for
header type recognition,
<B>tar</B>

type properties, EOF recognition, opening 
of remote archives and fifo internals.
<DT><B>diffopts=</B><I>optlst</I>

<DD>
Comma separated list of diffopts.
Valid members in
<I>optlst</I>

are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>help</B>

<DD>
Print a summary of possible members of the diffopts list.
<DT><B>!</B>

<DD>
Invert the meaning of the following string. No comma is needed after the 
exclamation mark.
<DT><B>not</B>

<DD>
Invert the meaning of all members in the diffopts list i.e. exclude 
all present options from an initially complete set compare list.
When using 
<B><A HREF="../man1/csh.1.php">csh</A></B>(1)

you might have problems to use 
<B>!</B>

due to its strange parser.
This is why the 
<B>not</B>

alias exists.
<DT><B>perm</B>

<DD>
Compare file permissions. With this option in effect, 
<B>star </B>

compares the low order 12 bits of the st_mode field.
<DT><B>mode</B>

<DD>
Same as 
<I>perm.</I>

<DT><B>type</B>

<DD>
Compare file type. 
Note that 
<B>star</B>

cannot compare the file type in case of a hard link.
<DT><B>nlink</B>

<DD>
Compare link count on hardlinks.
This only works if the archive is in
<B>exustar</B>

format and contains
<B>star's</B>

dump extensions.
<DT><B>uid</B>

<DD>
Compare numerical user id of file.
<DT><B>gid</B>

<DD>
Compare numerical group id of file.
<DT><B>uname</B>

<DD>
Compare ASCII version of user id of file.
The user name is mapped via the file /etc/passwd.
<DT><B>gname</B>

<DD>
Compare ASCII version of group id of file.
The group name is mapped via the file /etc/group.
<DT><B>id</B>

<DD>
Shorthand for:
<I>uid,gid,uname,gname</I>.

Compare all user/group related info of file.
Note that this will always find differences if the source and
target system use different user or group mappings.
<DT><B>size</B>

<DD>
Compare file size.
Note that 
<B>star</B>

cannot compare the file size in case of a hard link.
<DT><B>data</B>

<DD>
Compare content of file.
If
<B>star</B>

already found that the size of the files differ, it will not
compare the content anymore.
<DT><B>cont</B>

<DD>
Same as 
<I>data.</I>

<DT><B>rdev</B>

<DD>
Compare major/minor numbers for device nodes.
<DT><B>hardlink</B>

<DD>
Compare target of hardlinks.
<DT><B>symlink</B>

<DD>
Compare target of symlinks. This evaluates the value returned by the 
<A HREF="../man2/readlink.2.php">readlink</A>(2) call.
<DT><B>sparse</B>

<DD>
Compare if either both files are sparse or not. If only one of both files
is sparse, then a difference is flagged.
This only works with if the archive format is
<B>star</B>,

<B>xstar</B>,

<B>xustar</B>,

<B>exustar</B>,

or
<B>gnutar</B>.

<DT><B>atime</B>

<DD>
Compare access time of file. 
This only works with if the archive format is
<B>star</B>,

<B>xstar</B>,

<B>xustar</B>,

<B>exustar</B>,

or
<B>pax</B>.

<DT><B>mtime</B>

<DD>
Compare modification time of file.
<DT><B>ctime</B>

<DD>
This only works with if the archive format is
<B>star</B>,

<B>xstar</B>,

<B>xustar</B>,

<B>exustar</B>,

or
<B>pax</B>.

<DT><B>times</B>

<DD>
Shorthand for:
<I>atime,mtime,ctime</I>.

<DT><B>dir</B>

<DD>
Compare the content of directories.
This only works if the archive is in
<B>exustar</B>

format and contains
<B>star's</B>

dump extensions.
Together with increased verbose level
(<B>-vv</B>)

this will print a list of files that are only in the archive and a list of files
that are only on the current filesystem.
</DL>
<P>

If 
<I>optlst</I>

starts with a ! the meaning of all members in 
<I>optlst</I>

is inverted as with the 
<I>not</I>

optlist member.
<P>

If 
<I>diffopts</I>

are not specified, 
<B>star </B>

compares everything but the access time of the files.
</DL>

<DT><B>-dirmode</B>

<DD>
If in create mode (i.e. when storing files to archive),
<B>star </B>

stores directories past the corresponding files. This guarantees that even old 
<B>tar</B>

implementations without a directory cache will be able to restore the
correct times of directories.
<DT><B>-dodesc</B>

<DD>
Force 
<B>star</B>

to descend directories found in a
<B>list=</B><I>file.</I>

See also the 
<B>-D</B>

option above.
<DT><B>-dump</B>

<DD>
This currently is an experimental option to make it easier to implement a
<B>star</B>

version that supports
<I>true incremental dumps</I>.

<B>Star</B>

currently sets the archive type to
<B>exustar</B>

and archives more inode meta data inside POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
<DT><B>errctl=</B><I> name</I>

<DD>
Use the file
<I>name</I>

as error control file.
The reason for using an error control file is to make
<B>star</B>

quiet about error conditions that are known to be irrelevant on the quality 
of the archive or restore run. A typical reason to use error control is to
suppress warnings about growing log files while doing a backup on a
life file system.
<P>
The error control file contains a set of lines, each starting with a list
of error conditions to be ignored followed by white space followed by a
file name pattern (see 
<B><A HREF="../man1/match.1.php">match</A></B>(1)

or
<B><A HREF="../man3/patmatch.3.php">patmatch</A></B>(3)

for more information).
If the file name pattern needs to start with white space, use a backslash
to escape the start of the file name. It is not possible to have new line
characters in the file name pattern.
Whenever an error situation is encountered, 
<B>star</B>

checks the lines in the error control file starting from the top.
If the current error condition is listed on a line in the error control file,
then
<B>star</B>

checks whether the pattern on the rest of the line matches the current file name.
If this is the case, 
<B>star</B>

ignores the current error condition.
<P>
The list of error conditions to be ignored may use one or more (in this case
separated by a '|' character) identifiers from the list below:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

This currently applies to all files that have a '/../' sequence inside
when
<B>-..</B>

has not been specified.
<DT><B>LSECURITY</B>

<DD>
Suppress warnings about links that
have been skipped on extraction because they have been considered to be a 
security risk.
This currently applies to all link names that start with '/' or
have a '/../' sequence inside when 
<B>-secure-links</B>

has been specified.
In this case, 
<B>star </B>

tries to match the link name against the pattern in the error control file.
<DT><B>SAMEFILE</B>

<DD>
Suppress warnings about links that
have been skipped on extraction because source and target of the link
are pointing to the same file.
If 
<B>star</B>

would not skip these files, it would end up with removing the file completely.
In this case, 
<B>star </B>

tries to match the link name against the pattern in the error control file.
<DT><B>BADACL</B>

<P>
If a specific error condition is ignored, then the error condition is not
only handled in a silent way but also excluded from the error statistics
that are printed at the end of the
<B>star</B>

run.
<P>
Be very careful when using error control as you may ignore any error condition.
If you ignore the wrong error conditions, you may not be able to see real
problems anymore.
<DT><B>-F</B>,<B>-FF</B> ...

<DD>
Fast and simple exclude option for create mode.
With one
<B>-F</B>

argument,
<B>star</B>

ignores all directories called
<I>SCCS</I> and <I>RCS.</I>

With two
<B>-F</B>

arguments,
<B>star</B>

in addition ignores all files called
<I>core errs a.out</I>

all files ending with

<I>OBJ/</I>.

With three

<DT><B>-fifo</B>

<DD>
Use a 
<I>fifo</I>

to optimize data flow from/to 
<I>tarfile.</I>

This option is in effect by default (it may be changed at compile time).
The default fifo size is 8 MBytes on all platforms except Linux versions
that do not support mmap() (4 MB because kernels
before 2.4 did not handle big shared memory areas) and Sun/mc68000 (1 MB).
This will 
<B>star</B>

make even work on a tiny machine like
a Sun 3/50. The fifo size may be modified with the 
<I>fs=</I>

option. A rule of dumb for the fifo size is to use more than the buffer size
of the tape drive and less then half of the real memory of the machine.
A good choice would be to use a fifo size between 8 and 256 MB.
This may increase backup speed up to 5% compared to the speed achieved
with the default fifo size. Note that with a DLT drive that gives 12MB/s
transfer rate, a fifo of 256 MB size will keep the tape at least streaming
in units of 20 seconds.
All options that start with the 
<B>-f</B>

sequence are sensitive to typo problems, see BUGS section for more information.
<DT><B>-fifostats</B>

<DD>
Print fifo statistics at the end of a

All options that start with the 
<B>-f</B>

<DT><B>file=</B>tarfilename, <B>f=</B>tarfilename

<DD>
Use 
<I>tarfilename </I>

as the name for the
<B>tar</B>

archive. Currently up to 100 
<B>file=</B>

options are possible. Specifying more then one 
<B>file= </B>

option make sense in multi volume mode. In this case 
<B>star</B>

will use the next name in the list every time a media change is needed.
To make 
<B>star </B>

behave consistent with the single file case, 
<B>star</B>

loops over the list of known archive files.
Note that if
<B>star</B>

is installed suid root and the first tarfile is a remote archive,
only the connection to this archive will be created with root privileges.
After this connection has been established as root,
<B>star</B>

switches back to the id of the caller.
If any of the other archives in the list is located on a different host,
<B>star</B>

will not be able to open this archive later on, unless run by root.
<P>
<B>Star</B>

normally uses
<I>stdin</I>/<I>stdout</I>

for the
<B>tar</B>

archive because the most common way to use 
<B>star</B>

is in conjunction with pipes.
If 
<B>star</B>

is installed suid root or if it has been called by root,
<I>tarfilename</I>

may be in remote syntax: <A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A>:filename as in 
<B><A HREF="../man1/rcp.1.php">rcp</A></B>(1)

even if 
invoked by non root users.
See SUID NOTES for more information.
<P>
To make a file local although it includes a colon (:), the filename
must start with:
<I>'/'</I>,

<I>'./'</I> or

<I>'../'</I>

<P>
Note that if
<B>star </B>

talks to an old 
<B>rmt</B>

remote tape server that does not support symbolic open modes,
it does not open a remote tape with the 
<B>O_CREAT</B>

open flag because this would be extremely dangerous.
If the 
<B>rmt </B>

server on the other side is the 
<B>rmt</B>

server that comes with 
<B>star</B>

or the GNU
<B>rmt</B>

server,
<B>star</B>

may use the symbolic mode for the open flags.
Only the symbolic open modes allow to send all possible open
modes in a portable way to remote tape servers.
<P>
It is recommended to use the 
<B>rmt</B>

server that comes with
<B>star</B>.

It is the only
<B>rmt</B>

server that gives platform independent compatibility with BSD, Sun and GNU
<B>rmt </B>

clients and it includes security features that may be set up in /etc/default/rmt.
All options that start with the

<DT><B>H=</B><I>headertype</I>

If this option is used in extract/list mode this forces 
<B>star</B>

to interpret the headers to be of type 
<I>headertype.</I>

As 
<B>star</B>

even in case of a user selected extract archive format does format checking,
it may be that you will not be able to unpack a specific archive with all
possible forced archive formats. Selecting the old
<B>tar</B>

Valid parameter for 
<I>headertype</I>

are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT><B>tar</B>

<DD>
Old UNIX
<B>tar</B>

This archive format may only store plain files, directories and 
symbolic links.
Pathnames or linknames longer than 99 chars may not be archived.
See also the 
<B>-d</B>

option as a note to some even older tar implementations.
<P>
If the
<B>tar</B>

File size is limited to 2 GB - 2 bytes, uid/gid is limited to 262143.
Sparse files will be filled up with zeroes.
<DT><B>star</B>

<DD>
Old 
<B>star </B>

standard format. This is an upward/downward compatible 
enhancement of the 
<I>old </I>

(pre Posix) UNIX
<B>tar</B>

format.
It has been introduced in 1985 and therefore is not Posix compliant.
The
<B>star</B>

format allows to archive special files (even sockets) and records access time and 
creation time besides the modification time. Newer versions of the old 
<B>star </B>

format allow very long filenames (100+155&nbsp;chars and above), linknames &gt; 100 chars
and sparse files.
This format is able to copy the device nodes on HP-UX
that have 24 bits in the minor device number, which is more then the 21 bits
that are possible with the POSIX-1003.1-1988 archive format.
<P>
The nonstandard extensions are located in the space between the link name and
the POSIX file name prefix.
As the
<B>star</B>

format does not use a POSIX magic string, the extensions do not interfere
with the POSIX tar formats.
The last 4 bytes of the
<B>tar</B>

header contain a 'tar\0' signature.
<DT><B>gnutar</B>

<DD>
This is a commonly used, but unfortunately not Posix compliant
(although designed after 1987)
enhancement to the old
<B>tar </B>

format.
The 
<B>gnutar</B>

format has been defined between 1989 and 1994.
Do not use the
<B>gnutar</B>

archive format unless you want to create an archive for a target system
that is known to have only the gnutar program available.
The
<B>gnutar</B>

archive format violates basic rules for any (even the historic) tar archive format.
Using the
<B>gnutar</B>

archive format causes a high risk that the resulting archive may only be read
by gnutar or by
<B>star</B>.

The implementation of the gnutar archive format within 
<B>star</B>

is not complete, but 
sufficient for most gnutar archives.
See NOTES for more information.
<DT><B>ustar</B>

IEEE/Posix1003/IEC-9945-1-1988 Standard Data Interchange format.
With this option in effect,

the default archive format is
<B>ustar</B>.

<P>
If the
<B>ustar</B>

format has been selected, 
<B>star</B>

will not use enhancements to the POSIX.1-1988 tar format, the archive

archive format.
<P>
If the

File size is unlimited, uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited,
major/minor is limited to 2097151.
Sparse files will be filled up with zeroes.
<DT><B>xstar</B>

<DD>
The extended standard
<B>tar</B>

format has been introduced in 1994.  
<B>Star</B>

uses the
<B>xstar</B>

format as default archive format. 
This is an upward/downward compatible enhancement 
of the IEEE/Posix1003/IEC-9945-1 Standard Data Interchange format.
It allows among others very long filenames (100+130&nbsp;chars and above) 
and records access time and creation time.
<P>
The access time and creation time are stored at the end of the POSIX
file name prefix (this limits the prefix to 130 chars).
These extensions do not interfere with the POSIX standard as the
fields for mtime and ctime field are always separated from the 
POSIX file name prefix by a null byte.
The last 4 bytes of the
<B>tar</B>

header contain a 'tar\0' signature.
<P>
The 
<B>xstar</B>

format is the default format when
<B>star</B>

is neither called as
<B>tar </B>

nor called as
<B>ustar</B>.

<DT><B>xustar</B>

<DD>
A new format introduced 1998, that omits the
'tar\0' signature at the end of the
<B>tar</B>

header. It is otherwise identical
to the
<B>xstar</B>

format.
As some
<B>tar</B>

implementations do not follow the POSIX rules and compute
the checksum for less than 512 bytes of the
<B>tar</B>

header, this format may help
to avoid problems with these broken
<B>tar</B>

implementations.
The main other difference to the
<B>xstar</B>

format is that the
<B>xustar</B>

format uses POSIX.1-2001 extended headers to overcome limitations of the
historic
<B>tar</B>

format while the
<B>xstar</B>

format uses proprietary extensions.
The 
<B>xustar</B>

format is the default format when
<B>star</B>

is called as
<B>tar</B>.

<P>
File size is unlimited, uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited,
major/minor is unlimited.
Sparse files will be archived correctly.
<DT><B>exustar</B>

<DD>
A format similar to the
<B>xustar</B>

format but with forced POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
If this format is used together with the
<B>-acl</B>

option,
<B>star</B>

records Access Control Lists (ACLs) in POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
<P>
File size is unlimited, uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited,
major/minor is unlimited.
Sparse files will be archived correctly.
<DT><B>suntar</B>

<DD>
The extended header format found on Solaris 7/8/9. This format is similar to the
<B>pax</B>

format but does not handle 
<I>atime</I>

and
<I>ctime</I>

and in addition uses 'X' as the typeflag for the extended headers instead of
the standard 'x'.
<P>
File size is unlimited, uid/gid/uname/gidname is unlimited,
major/minor is unlimited.
Sparse files will be filled up with zeroes.
<DT><B>cpio</B>

<DD>
The POSIX.1-1988 
<B>cpio</B>

format. This format uses octal ascii headers. A similar format is
created by calling
<I>cpio -o -c</I>

on pre SYSVr4 systems and by calling
<I>cpio -o -Hodc</I>

on SYSVr4 systems.
The POSIX.1-1988 
<B>cpio</B>

format allows a file name length up to 262142 characters and allows to
archive nearly any file type.
File size is limited to 8 GB, uid/gid/st_dev is limited to 262143.
The way major and minor device numbers are stored inside the st_dev
field is implementation dependent.
<P>
Even though this archive format is covered by the POSIX.1-1988 standard,
it has a lower portability than the
<B>ustar</B>

format. Try to avoid the 
<B>cpio</B>

archive format.
<DT><B>odc</B>

<DD>
This archive format is similar to the The POSIX.1-1988
<B>cpio</B>

format but the file name length is limited to 255 characters and
the socket file type is not allowed.
This archive format has been introduced to allow non POSIX cpio implementations
such as the cpio program on SYSV to accept the archive. Use this
format whenever you are not sure if the target system offers a fully POSIX
compliant cpio program.
<P>
Even though this archive format is covered by the POSIX.1-1988 standard,
it has a lower portability than the
<B>ustar</B>

format. Try to avoid the 
<B>odc</B>

archive format.
<DT><B>asc</B>

<DD>
Tell
<B>star</B>

to create a
<B>cpio</B>

archive in the ascii format that is created with
<I>cpio -o -c</I>

on SYSVr4 systems.
It uses extended (32 bit) numbers for uid's, gid's and device numbers
but limits the file size to 2 GB - 2 bytes although the format has been
specified after the POSIX.1-1988 cpio format.
Try to avoid the
<B>asc</B>

archive format because of it's limited portability.
<DT><B>crc</B>

<DD>
This format is similar to the
<B>asc</B>

cpio format but in addition uses a simple byte based checksum called
<B>CRC</B>.

Try to avoid the
<B>crc</B>

archive format because of it's limited portability.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

All

In create mode, this option tells

<DT><B>-hpdev</B>

<DD>
Allow 24 bits for the minor device number using 8 octal digits.
Note that although it allows to create
<B>tar</B>

archives
that can be read with HP-UX tar, this creates
<B>tar</B>

archives
which violate POSIX.1-1988.
This option is only needed if you like to use a POSIX.1-1988 based archive
format that does not include extensions.
If you use the
<B>xstar</B>

format, 
<B>star</B>

will use a base 256 extension that allows bigger major/minor numbers by default,
if you use the
<B>xustar </B>

or the
<B>exustar</B>

format there is no limitation at all as these formats use POSIX.1-2001
extended headers to archive the major/minor numbers by default.
<DT><B>-i</B>

<DD>
Ignore checksum errors on
<B>tar</B>

will not exit if a header with a bad checksum is found but search for the
next valid header.
<DT><B>-keep_old_files</B>

<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
Do not print a warning message if not all links to hard linked files
could be dumped. This option is evaluated in the opposite way to historic
<B><A HREF="../man1/tar.1.php">tar</A></B>(1)

implementations and to POSIX.1.
POSIX.1 requests that by default no warning messages will be printed
and
<B>-l</B>

will enable warning messages when not all links could be archived.
<DT><B>level=</B>dumplevel

<DD>
Set level for incremental dumps. This is currently an experimental option.
See also the
<B>tardumps=</B><I>name</I>

and
<B>-wtardumps</B>

options.
<DT><B>-link-dirs</B>

<DD>
When in create mode, try to find hard linked directories.
Using
<B>-link-dirs</B>

will force 
<B>star</B>

to keep track of all directories that will go into the archive and thus
causes a lot more memory to be allocated than in the default case.
<P>
If you like to extract a
<B>cpio</B>

archive that contains hard linked directories, you also need to specify
<B>-link-dirs</B>

in extract or diff mode.
This is needed because many
<B>cpio</B>

implementations create buggy archives with respect to hard links.
If 
<B>star</B>

would look for hard linked directories in all cases, it would
detect many pseudo hard links to directories.
Use
<B>-link-dirs</B>

with care if you extract 
<B>cpio</B>

archives.
<P>
Note that not all filesystem allow to create hard links to directories.
Also note that even though a non-root user is able detect and archive
hard linked directories, all known operating systems require the extraction
to be done as root in order to be able to create or remove hard links to directories.
For this reason its only recommended to use this option when doing accurate
backups and when hard links to directories are expected.
<P>
When the option
<B>-link-dirs</B>

is not used and hard links to directories are present, the appendant sub-tree
will appear more than once on the archive and
<B>star</B>

will print 
<I>Linkcount below zero</I>

warnings for non directory hard links inside the sub-tree.
<DT><B>list=</B>filename

<DD>
Read filenames for store/create/list command from
<I>filename.</I>

The file
<I>filename</I>

must contain a list of filenames, each on a separate line.
This option implies the 
<B>-D </B>

option.
To force
<B>star</B>

to descend directories, use the
<B>-dodesc</B>

option in this case.
<DT><B>-lowmem</B>

<DD>
Try to run with reduced memory requirements.
This causes
<B>star</B>

to default to 1 MB of FIFO memory.
Instead of allocating memory to hold the directory content and reading the
directory at once,
<B>star</B>

reads the directory name by name. This may cause
<B>star</B>

to close the directory if it rans out of file descriptors because of deeply
nested directories. If a directory then does not support
<B><A HREF="../man3/telldir.3.php">telldir</A>(3)/<A HREF="../man3/seekdir.3.php">seekdir</A>(3)</B>,

<B>star</B>

will fail.
<DT><B>-M</B>

<DD>
Do not descend mount points.
This is useful when doing backups of complete filesystems. 
See NOTES for more information.
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
Do not restore access and modification time. 
(Access time is only available if 
<B>star</B>

is reading 
<B>star</B>,

<B>xstar</B>,

<B>xustar</B>,

<B>exustar</B>,

or
<B>pax</B>

archives). If 
<B>star</B>

extracts other archive types, the 
<B>-m</B>

flag only refers to the modification time.
<P>
<DT><B>maxsize=</B>#

<DD>
Do not store files in
<I>tarfile</I>

if they are bigger than #.
See 
<I>bs=</I>

for the possible syntax.
By default, the number is multiplied by
1024, so the value counts in units of kBytes.
If the size specifier ends with a valid multiplication character
(e.g '.' for bytes or 'M' for MB) the specified size is used as specified
and not multiplied by 1024.
See
<B>bs=</B>

option for all possible multipliers.
<DT><B>-meta</B>

<DD>
This currently is an experimental option. In create mode, it causes 
<B>star</B>

to archive all 
<B>meta</B>

data of the file (e.g. uid, permissions, ...) but not the
file content. In extract mode, it causes 
<B>star</B>

to restore all 
<B>meta</B>

data but not the file content. In addition, in extract mode
no plain file, special file or directory will be created.
<B>Meta</B>

files are needed in future 
<B>star</B>

versions that support incremental backups.
<P>
Warning: Do not try to extract
<B>star</B>

archives containing
<B>meta</B>

files using other tar implementations if they are not aware of the
<B>meta</B>

file extensions of 
<B>star</B>.

<B>Star</B>

tries to force all tar implementations that are not standard compliant to abort.
<B>Star </B>

also tries to make all non POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar implementations unable
to find a valid filename. However when other POSIX.1-2001 aware tar implementations
come up and don't know about
<B>meta</B>

files, they will destroy files on disk.
<P>
The problems result from the only current fallback in the POSIX standard that 
tells tar implementations to treat all unknown file types as if they were 
plain files. As 
<B>meta</B>

files are needed for incremental backups, I am looking for people and companies 
who like to support me to be able to add the 
<B>meta</B>

file concept to the POSIX.1-2005 standard.
<DT><B>-modebits</B>

<DD>
This options allows you to create
<B>tar</B>

archives that include
more than 12 bits from st_mode. Note this create
<B>tar</B>

archives
that violate POSIX but some
<B>tar</B>

implementations insist in reading
such nonstandard archives.
<DT><B>newer=</B>filename

<DD>
Do not store files to

if their modification time is not newer than the modification time of
<I>filename.</I>

See 
<B>-ctime</B>

option for changing this behavior.

<DD>
Call 
<I>script</I>

at end of each tape if in multi volume mode.
If this option is not in effect, 
<B>star</B>

will ask the user to confirm the volume change.
The script is called with two parameters.
The first parameter is the next volume number and the second
parameter is the next archive file name.
<DT><B>-nodump</B>

<DD>
If this option is set, 
<B>star</B>

will not dump files that have the
<B>nodump</B>

flag set. Note that this currently only works on BSD-4.4 derivates
and on Linux.
On Linux, using this option will cause a performance degradation
(the system time increases by 10%) because of the unlucky kernel interface.
<DT><B>-no_fifo</B>

<DD>
obsoleted by -no-fifo
<DT><B>-no-fifo</B>

<DD>
Don't use a
<I>fifo</I>

to optimize data flow from/to 
<I>tarfile.</I>

Currently the 
<I>-fifo </I>

option is used as default. (This may be changed at compile time.)
<DT><B>-no-fsync</B>

<DD>
Do not call
<B><A HREF="../man2/fsync.2.php">fsync</A>(2)</B>

for each file that has been extracted from the archive. 
Using
<B>-no-fsync</B>

may speed up extraction on operating systems
with slow file I/O (such as Linux), but includes the risk that
<B>star</B>

may not be able to detect extraction problems that occur after the call
to
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.php">close</A></B>(2).

A typical cause for such problems is a NFS file system that
fills up before the buffer cache is synced or
a write error that occurs while the buffer cache is synced.
There may be other reasons.
Use with extreme care.
<DT><B>-nochown</B>, <B>-o</B>

<DD>
Do not restore owner and group of files. 
This may be used if super user privileges are needed to overwrite 
existing files but the local ownership of the existing files should 
not change.
<DT><B>-no_statistics</B>

<DD>
obsoleted by -no-statistics
<DT><B>-no-statistics</B>

<DD>
Do not print statistic messages at the end of a
<B>star</B>

run.
<DT><B>-no-xheader</B>

<DD>
Do not create or extract POSIX.1-2001 extended headers.
This option may be used if you like to read an archive with broken
extended headers.
<DT><B>-not</B>, <B>-V</B>

<DD>
Invert the meaning of the pattern list. i.e. use those files which do not match
any of the pattern.
Note that this option only applies to patterns that have been specified
via the
<B>pattern=</B>pattern or <B>pat=</B>pattern

option. Patterns specified as file type arguments will not be affected.
<DT><B>-notarg</B>, <B>-pax-c</B>

<DD>
Match all file or archive members except those specified by the pattern or file operands.
<DT><B>-nowarn</B>

<DD>
Do not print warning messages.
This sometimes is useful to make the output more readable
(e.g. when hundreds of files that are going to be extracted are not newer
in the archive then on the filesystem).
<DT><B>-numeric</B>

<DD>
Use the numeric user/group fields in the listing rather than the 
default.
The default allows to list the ASCII version of user/group of the file
and to extract the owners of the files based on numeric values rather
than the names.
In create mode, no user/groups names are put on the archive.
The
<B>-numeric</B>

option also applies when ACLs are going to be archived or extracted.
<DT><B>-O</B>

<DD>
Be compatible to old versions of
<B>tar</B>.

If 
<B>star </B>

is invoked with this option, 
<B>star </B>

generates archives which are 
fully compatible with old UNIX
<B>tar</B>

archives. If in extract mode, 
<B>star </B>

ignores any additional info in the headers.
This implies neither that archives generated with this option are 
binary equal with archives generated by old
<B>tar</B>

versions nor that 
<B>star </B>

is trying to comprehend all bugs that are found in old
<B>tar</B>

versions.
The bug in old
<B>tar</B>

versions that cause a reversal of a space and a NULL byte 
in the checksum field is not repeated. 
If you want to have signed checksums you have to specify the
<I>-singed-checksum</I>

option too. 
If you want directories not to be archived in order to be compatible
to very old historic tar archives, you need to specify the
<I>-d</I>

option too. 
<P>
This option is superseeded by the 
<B>H=</B>headertype

option.
<DT><B>-o</B>, <B>-nochown</B>

<DD>
Do not restore owner and group of files. 
This may be used if super user privileges are needed to overwrite 
existing files but the local ownership of the existing files should 
not change.
<DT><B>-onull</B>, <B>-nullout</B>

<DD>
Do not actually write to the archive but compute and add the sizes.
This is useful when trying to figure out if a tape may hold
the current backup.
Please only use the
<B>-onull</B>

option as it is a similar option as used by the
<B><A HREF="../man1/sdd.1.php">sdd</A></B>(1)

command.
<DT><B>-P</B>

<DD>
Allow 
<B>star</B>

to write a partial record as the last record. 
Normally, 
<B>star </B>

writes each record with the same size.
This option is useful on unblocked tapes i.e. cartridge tapes like QIC tapes
as well as with archives that are located in files.
If you use this option on local files, the size of the archive will be smaller.
If you use this option on cartridge tapes, is makes sure that later - in extract mode -
<B>star</B>

will read up to the end of file marker on the tape and the next call to
<B>star</B>

will read from the next archive on the same tape.
<DT><B>-p</B>

<DD>
Restore filemodes of directories. Without this option directories are 
created using the present 
<B><A HREF="../man2/umask.2.php">umask</A></B>(2).

If the archive contains Access Control Lists (ACLs) in
POSIX.1-2001 extended headers,
<B>star</B>

will restore the access control lists from the archive for files
if the -acl option is specified.
If the option -acl has not been specified, ACLs are not restored at all.
<DT><B>pattern=</B>pattern, <B>pat=</B>pattern

<DD>
Set matching pattern to
<I>pattern.</I>

A maximum of 100 pattern=pat options may be specified. 
As each pattern is unlimited in length, this is no real limitation.
If more than one pattern is specified, a file matches if any of the 
specified pattern matches.
Patterns may be used in create mode to select or exclude files
from the list of file type arguments or the files located in a sub tree
of a file type argument directory.
In extract or list mode, all file type arguments are interpreted to be
select pattern and all option type patterns may be either select or exclude patterns
depending on the presence or absence of the
<B>-not</B>

option.
If you use file type select patterns, they work exactly like the method
used by other (non pattern aware) 
<B><A HREF="../man1/tar.1.php">tar</A></B>(1)

implementations.
File type select patterns do not offer pattern matching but allow to restore subtrees.
To extract a complete sub tree 
from the directory
<I>dir</I>

with 
<B>star</B>

using the 
<B>pattern=</B>

option, use
<B>pattern=</B>

<I>dir/\\*</I>

if you like to select a subtree by using the historic method, use
<I>dir/</I>

as file type argument.
See manual page for 
<B><A HREF="../man1/match.1.php">match</A></B>(1)

for more details of the pattern matcher.
All patterns are selection patterns by default. To make them exclude patterns,
use the 
<B>-not</B>

or the
<B>-V </B>

option.
<DT><B>-pax-c</B>, <B>-notarg</B>

<DD>
Match all file or archive members except those specified by the pattern or file operands.
<DT><B>-pax-H</B>

<DD>
Follow symbolic links that have been encountered on the command line.
If the referenced file does not exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.
If the link is referencing a file type that cannot be archived with the current archive format,
the file information and type will be for the link itself.
<DT><B>-pax-i</B>

<DD>
Do interactive renaming in a way that has been defined for POSIX
<B>pax</B>.

<B>Star</B>

will print the original filename and prompt for a reply.
If you type just 
<B>RETURN</B>,

than the file is skipped.
If you type '.', then the original file name is retained.
If you type anything else, then this is taken as the new file name.
<DT><B>-pax-L</B>

<DD>
Follow symbolic links.
If the referenced file does not exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.

<DD>
Remove files before extraction.
If this option is in effect, 
<B>star</B>

will remove files before extracting a file from the archive.
This is needed if you want to change the file type or if you need
to break a hard link.
If you do not use either
<B>-ask-remove</B>

or
<B>-force-remove</B>

together with 
<B>-remove-first</B>,

this option is useless and no files will be removed.
<DT><B>-remove_recursive</B>

<DD>
obsoleted by -remove-recursive
<DT><B>-remove-recursive</B>

<DD>
Remove files recursive.
If removing of a file is permitted, 
<B>star</B>

will only remove files, specials and empty directories.
If this option is in effect,
<B>star</B>

will be allowed to recursively removes non empty directories too.
<DT><B>-S</B>

<DD>
Do not store/create special files.
A special files is any file except plain files, symbolic links and directories.
You need to be super user to extract special files.
<DT><B>-s</B><I> replstr</I>

<DD>
Modify file or archive member names named by a pattern according to the
substitution expression
<I>replstr</I>.

The format of 
<I>replstr</I>

is:
<P>
<B><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>-s&nbsp;</B><I>/old/new/[gp]</I>

<P>
The<BR>
<B>old</B>

pattern may use regular expressions and the 
<B>new</B>

string may contain the special character '&amp;'. The character '&amp;' is substituted by the
string that matches the
<B>old</B>

pattern.
The optional trailing 'g' means global substitution. If 'g' is not used, a substitution
pattern is only used once on a name.
If the optional trailing 'p' is used, the substitution is printed to standard error.
<P>
Up to 100 substitute options may be used. If more than one substitute option has been
specified,
<B>star</B>

will loop over all substitute patterns until one matches.
<P>
If the name substitutes to the empty string, the file is skipped.
<DT><B>-secure-links</B>

<DD>
Do not extract hard links or symbolic links if the link name (the target of the link)
starts with a slash (/) or if /../ is contained in the link name.
Tar archives containing such links could be used to compromise the system. If they are
unpacked together with a lot of other files, this may not even be noticed.
<P>
As the usability of a tar archiver would be limited if
<B>-secure-links</B>

checking would be done by default, 
<B>star</B>

makes link checking optional.
<P>
If you unpacked a tar archive using the
<B>-secure-links</B>

and did not get a security warning at the end of the 
<B>star</B>

run, all files and links have been extracted.
If you get a warning, you should unpack the archive a second time and specify the
options
<B>-k</B>, <B>-w</B> and <B>-nowarn</B>

in addition to the options used for the first run.
See SECURITY NOTES for more information.
<DT><B>-shm</B>

<DD>
Use System V shared memory for fifo. 
Normally 
<B>star</B>

is compiled to use mapped /dev/zero pages for the fifo, if the operating system 
supports this.
If 
<B>star</B>

is compiled to have both code for mapped pages and for System V shared memory,
<B>star</B>

will use shared memory instead of the default.
If the 
<I>-help</I>

menu doesn't show the 
<I>-shm </I>

flag you have no choice.
When using System V shared memory, you may have to raise the system's internal
limit for shared memory resources to get enough shared memory for 
<B>star</B>.

<DT><B>-signed_checksum</B>

<DD>
obsoleted by -signed-checksum
<DT><B>-signed-checksum</B>

<DD>
Use signed chars to calculate checksums. This violates the
<B>tar</B>

specs but old 
versions of 
<B>tar </B>

derived from the seventh edition of UNIX are implemented in this way.
Note: Only filenames and linknames containing chars with the most 
significant bit set may trigger this problem because all 
other fields only contain 7 bit ASCII characters, octal digits or binary 
zeroes.
<DT><B>-silent</B>

<DD>
Suppress informational messages like
<I>foobar is sparse</I>.

<DT><B>-sparse</B>

<DD>
Handle files with holes effectively on store/create.
Note that sparse files may not be archived this way if the archive format is
<B>tar</B>,

<B>ustar</B>,

<B>pax</B>,

or
<B>suntar</B>.

On Solaris-2.3 ... Solaris-2.5.1 there is a special ioctl() called 
<I>_FIOAI</I>

that allows root to get the allocation info more efficiently.
Other operating systems lack support to get the real allocation list
and force 
<B>star</B>

to scan the files to look for blocks that only contain null characters.
This may 
<B>star</B>

to assume more holes to be present than the number that the file really contains.
<DT><B>-symlinks</B>

<DD>
This option tells
<B>star</B>

in extract mode to try to create a symlink whenever a hardlink is encountered
in the archive.
<DT><B>-T</B>

<DD>
If the option 
<B>file= </B>

or 
<B>f= </B>

is omitted and the -T option is present, 
<B>star</B>

will use the device indicated by the 
<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>TAPE </B></FONT>
environment variable, 
if set.
<DT><B>tardumps=</B><I>name</I>

<DD>
Set the file name for tar dump dates database to
<B>name</B>.

The default name is 
<B>/etc/tardumps</B>.

See also 
<B>-wtardumps</B>

option.
<DT><B>-time</B>

<DD>
Print timing info.
See DIAGNOSTICS for more information.
<DT><B>-to_stdout</B>

<DD>
obsoleted by -to-stdout
<DT><B>-to-stdout</B>

<DD>
Extract files to stdout. This option may be used to extract
<I>tarfiles</I>

containing
<I>tarfiles</I>

(see examples below).
<DT><B>-tpath</B>

<DD>
Use this option together with the 
<I>-t</I>

option to get only a list of the 
pathnames of the files in the archive.
This may be used in shell scripts to generate a name list.
If used together with the 
<I>-diff </I>

option, 
<B>star</B>

will only print the names of the files that differ.
A second run of
<B>star </B>

may then be used to restore all files that had differences to the archive.
Use the
<I>list=</I>

option to specify the namelist in this case.
<DT><B>tsize=</B>#

<DD>
Set tape volume size to # to enable multi volume tape support.
See 
<I>bs=</I>

for the possible syntax.
By default, the number is multiplied by
512, so the value counts in units of 512 byte blocks.
If the size specifier ends with a valid multiplication character
(e.g '.' for bytes or 'M' for MB) the specified size is used as specified
and not multiplied by 512.
With this option in effect, 
<B>star </B>

is able to archive filesystems that are bigger then the tape size.
Files that do not fit on a single tape may not be stored with the 
current version of 
<B>star</B>.

<DT><B>-U</B>

<DD>
Restore files unconditionally.
By default, an older file from the archive will not replace a corresponding newer file on 
disk.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Increment verbose level by one.
This normally results in more output during operation.
See also in the description for the
<I>-t</I>

flag.
Normally, 
<B>star</B>

does its work silently.
If the verbose level is 2 or more and
<B>star</B>

is in create or update mode, 
<B>star</B>

will produce a listing to the format of the ls -l output.
<DT><B>-V</B>, <B>-not</B>

<DD>
Invert the meaning of the pattern list. i.e. use those files which do not match
any of the pattern.
Note that this option only applies to patterns that have been specified
via the
<B>pattern=</B>pattern or <B>pat=</B>pattern

option. Patterns specified as file type arguments will not be affected.
<DT><B>-version</B>

<DD>
Print version information and exit.
<DT><B>VOLHDR=</B>name

<DD>
Use
<I>name</I>

to generate a volume header.
<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
Do interactive creation, extraction or renaming. 
For every file that matches the list of patterns and that has a more 
recent modification time in the
<B>tar</B>

archive (if in extract mode and
the -U option is not specified) 
<B>star </B>

prints its name and asks:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>get/put ? Y(es)/N(o)/C(hange name) :</B>

</DL>
<P>

You may answer either `N' for No or &lt;Return&gt; to skip this file.
If you answer `Y' the file is extracted or archived on tape with its 
original name.
If you answer `C', you are prompted for a new name. This name is used 
for the filename on disk if 
<B>star </B>

is in extract mode or for the archive name if 
<B>star </B>

is in create mode.
</DL>

<P>
See SECURITY NOTES for more information.
<DT><B>-wready</B>

<DD>
This option tells
<B>Star </B>

to wait up to two minutes for the drive to become ready.
It has been added as a hack for a bug in the SunOS/Solaris
<I>st</I>

device driver. This driver has problems to sense the loading time 
with Exabyte drives with factory settings.
It also makes sense to use 
<B>-wready</B>

if multiple remote backups are made. In this case, the remote connection
is closed while the remote tape server is still writing a file mark.
If another remote backup is initiated before the old remote server did
finish to write the file mark, it would be impossible to open the
tape driver unless
<B>-wready</B>

is specified to tell
<B>star</B>

to wait for the drive to become ready again.
<DT><B>-wtardumps</B>

<DD>
Tell 
<B>star</B>

to update the file that contains the tar dump dates data base if in dump mode.
See also
<B>tardumps=</B><I>name</I>

option.
<DT><B>-xattr</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>-xattr-linux</B>

<DD>
Store and extract extended file attributes as found on Linux systems.
This option only makes sense when creating or extracting 
<B>exustar</B>

archives as it is based on POSIX.1-2001 extended tar headers.
<P>
The method used in the current implementation could be used to store and extract
extended file attributes from BSD too.
Note that the current implementation is not generic enough to cover more general
extended file attribute implementations as found on Solaris.
If
<B>star</B>

starts to implement a method that covers extended file attributes on Solaris,
the new method will be used then
<B>-xattr</B>

has been specified and
<B>-xattr-linux</B>

will refer to the old method.
The method used with
<B>-xattr-linux</B>

may go away in the future.
<DT><B>xdebug=</B><I>#, </I><B>xd=</B><I>#</I>

<DD>
Set extended debug level to #.
<DT><B>-xdir</B>

<DD>
Extract directories even if the corresponding directories on the
archive are not newer.
This is useful when for some reason, the directories are recorded
after their content (see
<B>-dirmode</B>

option), or when the permissions of some directories
must be set in any case.
<DT><B>-xfflags</B>

<DD>
Store and extract extended file flags as found on BSD and Linux systems.
This option only makes sense when creating or extracting 
<B>exustar</B>

archives as it is based on POSIX.1-2001 extended tar headers.
<DT><B>-z</B>

<DD>
run the input or output through a 
<B>gzip</B>

pipe.
This is currently a quick and dirty hack, that mainly will cover
the most common usage to compress the
<B>tar</B>

output if it is a file.
No reblocking will be done, so this option will currently only make sense
on plain files.
The environment variable
As both the
<B>-bz</B>

and the
<B>-z</B>

option are non standard, it makes sense to omit the
<B>-bz</B>

and the
<B>-z</B>

inside shell scripts if you are going to extract a compressed
archive that is located inside a plain file as
<B>star</B>

will auto detect compression and choose the right decompression
option to extract.
<B>STAR_COMPRESS_FLAG</B>

may be used to specify one option for gzip.
If you want to write write compressed archives to tape, you should use
<BR>

<I>star -c . | gzip | sdd ibs=4k obs=32k -fill of=/dev/rmt/1bn</I>

<BR>

or
<BR>

<I>star -c . | gzip | sdd ibs=4k obs=32k -fill ovsize=60m of=/dev/rmt/1bn</I>

requires all options to be combined into a single string that does not start with
a dash.
<B>Star</B>

by default assumes a command line syntax like a typical POSIX command and includes
a compatibility mode that allows to specify a command line syntax as documented
for the 
<B>UNIX-98 tar</B>

command.
If you believe that you found a bug in the way 
<B>star</B>

parses the command line, please first check your command line for correctness before
you make a bug report for
<B>star</B>.

<P>

If you like to write portable shell scripts that call tar, use the 
<B>UNIX-98 tar</B>

command line syntax (i.e. a single option string and no dash), choose the
commands and options from the following set of characters (
<I>rxtuc vxfblmo</I>

) and check the shell script with both, your local tar and
<B>star</B>

for correct behavior. It you expect the script to call gnutar, do not include
the
<B>-o</B>

option as gnutar implements this option in a way that violates UNIX-98.
<P>

<B>Star </B>

strips leading ./ sequences from pathnames. This lets 
<B>star </B>

in many cases store longer pathnames than other implementations.
<P>

The POSIX.1-1988 method (ustar format) of storing files with pathnames that are 
longer than 100 chars has some limitations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
The name field (100 chars) an inserted slash (`/') 
and the prefix field (155 chars) produce 
the pathname of the file. When recreating the original filename, 
name and prefix are concatenated, using 
a slash character in the middle. If a pathname does not fit in the 
space provided or may not be split at a slash character so that the 
parts will fit into 100 + 155 chars, the file may not be archived. 
Linknames longer than 100 chars may not be archived too.
</DL>
<P>

The 
<I>star</I>,

<I>xstar</I>,

<I>xustar</I>,

<I>exustar</I>,

<I>pax</I>,

and
<I>gnutar</I>

archive formats don't have these limitations. While gnutar uses a 
method that makes it impossible for other
<B>tar</B>

implementations (except 
<B>star</B>)

to restore filenames that are longer than 100 chars, the
<I>xstar</I>,

<I>xustar</I>,

<I>exustar</I>

and
<I>pax</I>

archive format uses a method that allows an POSIX.1-1988 compliant way of 
storing filenames, if the POSIX method would allow this.
When the archive format is
<I>xustar</I>,

<I>exustar</I>

or
<I>pax</I>

very long filenames are stored using extended headers from the POSIX.1-2001 standard.
<P>

Some buggy
<B>tar</B>

implementations will generate incorrect filenames 
during a restore operation if the archive contains pathnames or linknames of 
exactly 100 chars length.
<P>

<B>Star</B>

adds a 
<I>tar</I>

signature in the last four bytes of each
<B>tar</B>

header if the archive format is
<I>star</I>

or
<I>xstar</I>.

This is no problem
with the 
<B>star </B>

archive format as it is an extension of the old pre POSIX.1-1988 tar format.
On the other side, the 
<B>xstar</B>

archive format claims to be as POSIX.1-1988 compliant as possible. 
Inserting this 
<I>tar </I>

signature is a minor deviation from the standard that has the last 12 bytes
of each header reserved for future use. On the other side,
<B>tar</B>

implementations
such as some
<B>pax</B>

implementations that only compute checksums on the first 500 bytes of the header
are violating the standard that requests the checksum to be computed on all
512 bytes of the tar header. All
<B>tar</B>

implementations that are 100% Posix
compliant will be able to extract 
<B>xstar </B>

archives as long as no new standard is defined that claims the last 12 bytes
of the header for a different use.
But then the 
<B>ustar version</B>

number should be changed from `00'
to `01'.
Now, that the POSIX-2001 standard has been accepted, it is even predictable
that all extensions to the standard
<B>tar</B>

format will go into the POSIX.1-2001 extended headers
which are extensible to include any feature without future limitation.
The only known
<B>tar</B>

implementation that also uses the last 12 bytes of the
<B>tar</B>

header is Sun's
<B>tar</B>

which uses these 12 bytes for files that are split over
several archives. Such archives created by Sun's tar are not 
readable by the buggy 
<B>pax</B>

implementation too. The Sun extension is not incompatible to the 
<B>star </B>

signature because Sun expects an octal number at the beginning of the
12 byte field which is a null character in the
<B>star</B>

case.
<P>

<B>Star</B>

uses these four bytes since 1985 without problems.
If you need a 100% POSIX.1-1988 and 100% POSIX.1-2001 compliant tar archive,
you may use the
<I>xustar</I>,

<I>exustar</I>

or the
<I>pax</I>

archive format.
The probability of falsely detecting other
<B>tar</B>

formats as 
<B>xustar </B>

or
<B>exustar</B>

format however is higher.
<P>

There is no way to ask for the 
<I>n</I>-th

occurrence of a file.
<P>

The way EOF is handled by 
<B>star</B>

differs, whether the fifo is in effect or not.
If the fifo is not used, 
<B>star </B>

stops reading the archive if it 
encounters a logical EOF record in the archive. 
If the fifo is used, 
<B>star </B>

may read until the fifo is full or until the real EOF mark on tape is reached.
How much data 
<B>star actually reads depends on the time when the </B>

<B>star</B>

foreground process sends a fifo shutdown signal to the background fifo read
process.
<P>

Gnu tar often creates
<B>tar</B>

archives with incorrect logical EOF marks.
The standard requires two blocks that are completely zeroed, whereas gnutar
often only adds one of them.
<P>

Old versions of
<B>tar</B>

found on SYSVr3 and earlier cannot read
<B>tar</B>

archives 
with a blocksize greater than 10&nbsp;kBytes.
<P>

The method of storing 
<I>sparse</I>

files currently used with the 
<I>star</I>

and
<I>xstar</I>

format is not guaranteed to be used in later versions of 
<B>star</B>.

If the author decides to change this method, later versions of 
<B>star </B>

may not be able to restore sparse files from
<B>tar </B>

archives made by the current version of 
<B>star</B>.

<P>

Some
<B>tar</B>

implementations violate the standard in using only the first 500 
Bytes of the header for checksum computation. These
<B>tar</B>

implementations 
will not accept 
<I>star </I>

and 
<I>xstar</I>

type
<B>tar</B>

archives.
<P>

Sun's Solaris 2.x
<B>tar</B>

implementation violates the Posix standard. Tar 
archives generated by 
<B>star</B>

cause Sun's
<B>tar</B>

to print tar: impossible file type messages. You may 
ignore these messages.
<P>

Gnutar's dumpdirs are non standard and are currently not implemented.
<P>

If gnutar archives sparse files with more than four holes, it produces 
archives that violate the standard in a way that prevents other
<B>tar</B>

implementations to read these archives. 
<B>Star </B>

knows about that and is able to handle these gnutar archives.
<P>

The filetype 
<I>N</I>

(LF_NAMES) from gnutar (an obsolete method of storing long names) will never be 
implemented.

<H2>SECURITY NOTES</H2>

If you unpack a tar archive in a non empty directory, any file in that directory 
may be overwritten unless you specify the 
<B>-k</B>

option.
If the archive contains symbolic links or hard links, 
<B>star</B>

may even overwrite files outside the current directory.
As many other commands, 
<B>star</B>

usually has all possible permissions when run as root.
Unpacking archives as root thus may have fatal results to any file on your system.
Be very careful when you try to extract an archive that has not been
created by you. It is possible to create hand crafted tar archives that may overwrite
critical files (like /etc/passwd) on your system.
In addition all tar archives that have been created with the 
<B>list=</B>

option and tar archives where the
<B>C=</B>

option was not specified before all file type arguments may be critical.
<P>

A good advise is to extract all doubtful archives as non root in an empty
directory and to specify the 
<B>-secure-links</B>

option.
If you get a warning, you should unpack the archive a second time and specify the
options
<B>-k</B>, <B>-w</B> and <B>-nowarn</B>

in addition to the options used for the first run.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SUID NOTES</H2>

If 
<B>star</B>

is installed suid root, 
<B>star</B>

is able to make connections to remote archives for non root users. 
This is done by using the
<A HREF="../man3/rcmd.3.php">rcmd</A>(3) interface to get a connection to a <A HREF="../man1/rmt.1.php">rmt</A>(1) server.
<P>

<B>Star</B>

resets its effective uid back to the real user id immediately after setting up
the remote connection to the rmt server and before opening any other file.
<P>

If
<B>star </B>

has not been installed suid root and not called by root, it will try to create
the remote connection via
<B><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.php">rsh</A>(1)</B>

or
<B><A HREF="../man1/ssh.1.php">ssh</A>(1)</B>

(in case the environment
<B>RSH</B>

has been set to
<B>ssh</B>).

Note that in this case, the throughput to the remote tape server will be much
lower than with a connection that has been initiated via
<B><A HREF="../man3/rcmd.3.php">rcmd</A>(3)</B>.

<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LIMITATIONS</H2>

If
<B>star</B>

is running on a large file aware platform,
<B>star</B>

is able to handle files up to 8 GB in a mode that is compliant to the POSIX.1-1988
<B>ustar</B>

format. With a nonstandard 
<B>star</B>

specific extension, up to 95 bits may be used to code the filesize.
This will handle files up to 200,000,000 TB.
With the new POSIX.1-2001 extended headers
used by the
<I>xustar</I>,

<I>exustar</I>

and
<I>pax</I>

format, any filesize may be archived.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

The fact that the 
<B>-f</B>

option has to be implemented in a way that is compatible with old tar 
implementations gives several problems.
The options
<B>-fifostats</B>,

<B>-force-hole</B>,

<B>-force-remove</B>

and
<B>-fifo</B>

interfere with the
<B>-f</B>

option and the fact that they exist prevents users from using filenames like
e.g.
<B>ifo</B>

using the traditional way where the filename directly follows the string
<B>-f</B>

without any space between the option name and the file name.
However, there is no problem to use a file named
<B>ifo</B>

by by calling 
<B>-f ifo</B>,

<B>f=ifo</B>,

<B>-f=ifo</B>

or
<B>-f= ifo</B>.

Be careful not to make typos with the above options. The result could be
that a file is created as a result of the mistyped option.
<P>

There is currently no way to set the fifo lowwater and highwater marks.
<P>

There is currently no way to automatically delete files in the target file tree
if they are obsolete.
<B>Star </B>

should implement something similar to gnutar's dumpdirs.
<P>

If not invoked by the super user 
<B>star </B>

may not be able to extract files 
if they reside in read only directories.
<P>

<B>Star </B>

is not able to make a complete backup of a filesystem if files 
are hidden by a mount that is in effect on a directory of this 
filesystem.
This may be avoided in case of the ufs filesystem 
if the backup is made off a ufs snapshot (see the man page for
<B><A HREF="../man1m/fssnap.1m.php">fssnap</A></B>(1m)

It could be avoided for any filesystem if the loopback filesystem had an 
option that tells 
<I>lofs </I>

not to traverse mountpoints.
<P>

For now (late 2002), we know that the following programs
are broken and do not implement signal handling correctly:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>rsh<DD>
on SunOS-5.0...SunOS-5.9
<DT>ssh<DD>
from ssh.com
<DT>ssh<DD>
from openssh.org
</DL>
<P>

Sun already did accept a bug report for 
<B><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.php">rsh</A></B>(1)<B>/</B><A HREF="../man1/ssh.1.php">ssh</A>(1)<B>.</B>

Openssh.org accepted and fixed
a bug for their implementation of 
<B><A HREF="../man1/ssh.1.php">ssh</A></B>(1).

<P>

If you use 
<B>star</B>

to create a remote connection via an unfixed
<B><A HREF="../man1/rsh.1.php">rsh</A></B>(1)

or 
<B><A HREF="../man1/ssh.1.php">ssh</A></B>(1),

be prepared that terminal generated signals may interrupt the
remote connection.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>

<B>Star</B>

was first created in 1982 to extract tapes on a UNIX clone that had no
<B>tar</B>

command.
In 1985 the first fully functional version has been released as 
<B>mtar.</B>

<P>

When the old 
<B>star </B>

format extensions have been introduced in 1985, it was renamed to 
<B>star</B>

(Schily tar).
In 1994, Posix 1003.1-1988 extensions were added and 
<B>star </B>

was renamed to 
<B>star</B>

(Standard tar).
