<H2>NAME</H2>

wine - run Windows programs on Unix
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>wine </B><I>[wine_options] </I><B>[--] </B><I>program </I><B>[arguments ... ]</B>

<P>

For instructions on passing arguments to Windows programs, please see the
<B>PROGRAM/ARGUMENTS</B>

section of the man page.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>wine</B>

<I>program</I>

loads and runs the given program, where the program is a DOS, Windows 3.x,
or Win32 executable (x86 binaries only).
<P>

For debugging wine, use
<B>winedbg</B>

<I>program</I>

instead.
<P>

For running CUI executables (Windows console programs), use
<B>wineconsole</B>

instead of
<B>wine</B>


run). Not using
<B>wineconsole</B>

for CUI programs will only provide very limited console support, and your
program might not function properly.
<P>

<B>wine </B>

currently runs a growing list of applications written for all kinds of
Windows versions &gt;= Win2.0, e.g. Win3.1, Win95/98, NT.
Older, simpler applications work better than newer, more complex ones.
Using Windows ME or Win2000 components with Wine is more problematic than
using none at all or the ones from older Windows versions.
A large percentage of the API has been implemented,
although there are still several major pieces of work left to do.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION</H2>

Read the README file in the Wine source distribution and the wine.conf
man page to know what Wine requires and how it is installed from source.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>--debugmsg [xxx]#name[,[xxx1]#name1]</I>

<DD>
Turn debugging messages on or off.  
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

xxx is optional and can be one of the following: 
<I>err, </I>

<I>warn, </I>

<I>fixme, </I>

or 
<I>trace. </I>

If xxx is not specified, all debugging messages for the specified
channel are turned on.  Each channel will print messages about a particular
component of 
<B>wine.  </B>

# is required and can be either + or -.  Note that 
there is not a space after the comma between names. yyy are either the
name of a whole DLL or a single API entry by name you either
want to include or exclude from the relay listing.  Case doesn't matter
for these.  You can do the same for snoop.
<P>

For instance:
<P>

<I>--debugmsg warn+all</I>

will turn on all warning messages (recommended for debugging)
<BR>

<I>--debugmsg warn+dll,+heap</I>

will turn on DLL warning messages and all heap messages.  
<BR>

<I>--debugmsg fixme-all,warn+cursor,+relay</I>

will turn off all FIXME messages, turn on cursor warning messages, and turn
on all relay messages (API calls).
<BR>

<I>--debugmsg +relay</I>

will turn on all relay messages. For more control on including or excluding
functions and dlls look into the [Debug] section of the wine configuration file.

in the source distribution (FIXME: outdated).
</DL>

<DT><I>--dll name[,name[,...]]={native|builtin}[,{n|b}[,...]]</I>

<DD>
Selects the override type and load order of dll used in the loading
process for any dll. The default is set in the configuration
file. There are currently three types of libraries that can be loaded
into a process' address space: Native windows dlls (
<I>native</I>

), 
<B>wine </B>

internal dlls (
<I>builtin</I>

). The type may be abbreviated with the first letter of the type (
<I>n, b</I>

). Each sequence of orders must be separated by commas.
<BR>

Each dll may have its own specific load order. The load order
determines which version of the dll is attempted to be loaded into the
address space. If the first fails, then the next is tried and so
on. Multiple libraries with the same load order can be separated with
commas. It is also possible to use the --dll option several times, to
specify different loadorders for different libraries
<BR>

Examples:
<BR>

<I>--dll comdlg32,commdlg=n,b</I>

<BR>

Try to load comdlg32 and commdlg as native windows dll first and try
the builtin version if the native load fails.
<BR>

<I>--dll shell,shell32=n --dll c:rsrsfoorsrsbarrsrsbaz=b</I>

<BR>

Try to load the libraries shell and shell32 as native windows dlls. Furthermore, if 
an application request to load c:rsfoorsbarrsbaz.dll load the builtin library baz. 
<BR>

<I>--dll comdlg32,commdlg=b,n --dll shell,shell32=b --dll comctl32,commctrl=n</I>

<BR>

Try to load comdlg32 and commdlg as builtin first and try the native version
if the builtin load fails; load shell32/shell always as builtin and
comctl32/commctrl always as native.
<BR>

Note: It is wise to keep dll pairs (comdlg32/commdlg, shell/shell32, etc.)
having exactly the same load order. This will prevent mismatches at runtime.
See also configuration file format below.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROGRAM/ARGUMENTS</H2>

The program name may be specified in DOS format (
<I>C:rsrsWINDOWSrsrsSOL.EXE)</I>

or in Unix format (
<I>/msdos/windows/sol.exe</I>

).  You may pass arguments to the program being executed by adding them 
to the end of the command line invoking
<B>wine</B>

(such as: wine notepad C:rsrsTEMPrsrsREADME.TXT).
Note that you need to 'rs' escape special characters (and spaces) when invoking Wine via
a shell, e.g.
<P>

wine C:rsrsProgramrs FilesrsrsMyPrgrsrstest.exe
<P>

Command line processing goes as
follows: first 
<B>wine</B>

checks whether one or more of the above mentioned 
<B>wine </B>

options have been specified. These
are removed from the command line, which is passed to the windows program. You can use
the parameter 
<I>-- </I>

to indicate that 
<B>wine </B>

should stop command line processing. This is needed in case a windows program understands 
an option that is usually interpreted (and thus removed from the command line) 
by 
<B>wine. </B>

For example, if you want to execute 
<B>wine </B>

with the options 
<I>--dll riched32=n</I>

and if 
<B>wine </B>

should run the program 
<I>myapp.exe</I>

with the arguments
<I>--display 3d somefile</I>

, then you could use the following command line to invoke 
<B>wine:</B>

<P>

<I>wine --dll riched32=n -- myapp.exe --display 3d somefile</I>

<P>

Note that in contrast to previous versions of 
<B>wine, </B>

you must not pass 
program name and program option in one argument to 
<B>wine. </B>

To run more
than one windows program, just execute 
<B>wine </B>

once with the name of each program as argument. 
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2>

<B>wine</B>

makes the environment variables of the shell from which
<B>wine</B>

is started accessible to the windows/dos processes started. So use the
appropriate syntax for your shell to enter environment variables you need.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>WINEPREFIX</I>

<DD>
If set, the content of this variable is taken as the name of the directory where
<B>wine</B>

stores its data (the default is 
<I>$HOME/.wine</I>

). This directory contains also the socket, which is used to communicate with the
<I>wineserver.</I>

All 
<B>wine</B>

processes using the same 
<B>wineserver</B>

(i.e.: same user) share certain things like registry, shared memory,
and config file.
By setting 
<I>WINEPREFIX</I>

to different values for different 
<B>wine</B>

processes, it is possible to run a number of truly independent 
<B>wine</B>

processes. 
<DT><I>WINESERVER</I>

<DD>
Specifies the path and name of the
<B>wineserver</B>

binary. If not set, Wine will try to load
<B>/usr/lib/wine/bin/wineserver,</B>

and if this doesn't exist it will then look for a file named
&quot;wineserver&quot; in the path and in a few other likely locations.
<DT><I>WINELOADER</I>

<DD>
Specifies the path and name of the
<B>wine</B>

binary to use to launch new Windows processes. If not set, Wine will
try to load
<B>/usr/lib/wine/bin/wine,</B>

and if this doesn't exist it will then look for a file named &quot;wine&quot; in
the path and in a few other likely locations.
<DT><I>WINEDLLPATH</I>

<DD>
Specifies the path(s) in which to search for builtin dlls and Winelib
applications. This is a list of directories separated by &quot;:&quot;. In
addition to any directory specified in
<I>WINEDLLPATH,</I>

Wine will also look in
<B>/usr/lib/wine/lib/wine.</B>

<DT><I>DISPLAY</I>

<DD>
Specifies the X11 display to use.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION FILE</H2>

<B>wine</B>

expects a configuration file (
<I>$WINEPREFIX/config</I>

(~/.wine/config)
), which must conform to the format specified in the
<B><A HREF="../man5/wine.conf.5.php">wine.conf</A></B>(5)

man page. A sample configuration file is documentation/samples/config in the 
<B>wine </B>

source archive.
