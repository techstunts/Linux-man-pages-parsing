<H2>OVERVIEW</H2>

Because zsh contains many features, the zsh manual has been split into
a number of sections.  This manual page includes all the separate manual pages in the
following order:

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive
login shell and as a shell script command processor.  Of the standard shells,
zsh most closely resembles <B>ksh</B> but includes many enhancements.  Zsh
has command line editing, builtin spelling correction, programmable
command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a history
mechanism, and a host of other features.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AUTHOR</H2>

Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad <B>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:pf@zsh.org">pf@zsh.org</A>&gt;</B>.
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers mailing
list <B>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:zsh-workers@sunsite.dk">zsh-workers@sunsite.dk</A>&gt;</B>.  The development is currently
coordinated by Peter Stephenson <B>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:pws@zsh.org">pws@zsh.org</A>&gt;</B>.  The coordinator
can be contacted at <B>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:coordinator@zsh.org">coordinator@zsh.org</A>&gt;</B>, but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AVAILABILITY</H2>

Zsh is available from the following anonymous FTP sites.  These mirror
sites are kept frequently up to date.  The sites marked with <I>(H)</I> may be
mirroring <B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.elte.hu">ftp.cs.elte.hu</A></B> instead of the primary site.

<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INVOCATION OPTIONS</H2>

The following flags are interpreted by the shell when invoked to determine
where the shell will read commands from:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-c</B>
Take the first argument as a command to execute, rather than reading commands
from a script or standard input.  If any further arguments are given, the
first one is assigned to <B>$0</B>, rather than being used as a positional
parameter.
<DT><B>-i</B><DD>
Force shell to be interactive.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
Force shell to read commands from the standard input.
If the <B>-s</B> flag is not present and an argument is given,
the first argument is taken to be the pathname of a script to
execute.
</DL>
<P>

After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as described above,
the remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.
<P>

For further options, which are common to invocation and the <B>set</B>
builtin, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshoptions.1.php">zshoptions</A></I>(1).
<P>

Options may be specified by name using the <B>-o</B> option.  <B>-o</B> acts like
a single-letter option, but takes a following string as the option name.
For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

runs the script <B>scr</B>, setting the <B>XTRACE</B> option by the corresponding
letter `<B>-x</B>' and the <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> option by name.
Options may be turned <I>off</I> by name by using <B>+o</B> instead of <B>-o</B>.
<B>-o</B> can be stacked up with preceding single-letter options, so for example
`<B>-xo shwordsplit</B>' or `<B>-xoshwordsplit</B>' is equivalent to
`<B>-x -o shwordsplit</B>'.
<P>

Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style,
`<B>--</B><I>option-name</I>'.  When this is done, `<B>-</B>' characters in the
option name are permitted: they are translated into `<B>_</B>', and thus ignored.
So, for example, `<B>zsh --sh-word-split</B>' invokes zsh with the
<B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> option turned on.  Like other option syntaxes, options can
be turned off by replacing the initial `<B>-</B>' with a `<B>+</B>'; thus
`<B>+-sh-word-split</B>' is equivalent to `<B>--no-sh-word-split</B>'.
Unlike other option syntaxes, GNU-style long options cannot be stacked with
any other options, so for example `<B>-x-shwordsplit</B>' is an error,
rather than being treated like `<B>-x --shwordsplit</B>'.
<P>

The special GNU-style option `<B>--version</B>' is handled; it sends to standard
output the shell's version information, then exits successfully.
`<B>--help</B>' is also handled; it sends to standard output a list of options
that can be used when invoking the shell, then exits successfully.
<P>

Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments that start with
`<B>-</B>' or `<B>+</B>' to be treated as normal arguments, in two ways.
Firstly, a lone `<B>-</B>' (or `<B>+</B>') as an argument by itself ends option
processing.  Secondly, a special option `<B>--</B>' (or `<B>+-</B>'), which may
be specified on its own (which is the standard POSIX usage) or may be stacked
with preceding options (so `<B>-x-</B>' is equivalent to `<B>-x --</B>').  Options
are not permitted to be stacked after `<B>--</B>' (so `<B>-x-f</B>' is an error),
but note the GNU-style option form discussed above, where `<B>--shwordsplit</B>'
is permitted and does not end option processing.
<P>

Except when the <B>sh</B>/<B>ksh</B> emulation single-letter options are in effect,
the option `<B>-b</B>' (or `<B>+b</B>') ends option processing.
`<B>-b</B>' is like `<B>--</B>', except that further single-letter options can be
stacked after the `<B>-b</B>' and will take effect as normal.
<P>

<P>


<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMPATIBILITY</H2>

Zsh tries to emulate <B>sh</B> or <B>ksh</B> when it is invoked as
<B>sh</B> or <B>ksh</B> respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first
letter of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `<B>r</B>'
(assumed to stand for `restricted'), and if that is `<B>s</B>' or `<B>k</B>' it
will emulate <B>sh</B> or <B>ksh</B>.  Furthermore, if invoked as <B>su</B> (which
happens on certain systems when the shell is executed by the <B>su</B>
command), the shell will try to find an alternative name from the <B>SHELL</B>
environment variable and perform emulation based on that.
<P>

In <B>sh</B> and <B>ksh</B> compatibility modes the following
parameters are not special and not initialized by the shell:
<B>ARGC</B>,
<B>argv</B>,
<B>cdpath</B>,
<B>fignore</B>,
<B>fpath</B>,
<B>HISTCHARS</B>,
<B>mailpath</B>,
<B>MANPATH</B>,
<B>manpath</B>,
<B>path</B>,
<B>prompt</B>,
<B>PROMPT</B>,
<B>PROMPT2</B>,
<B>PROMPT3</B>,
<B>PROMPT4</B>,
<B>psvar</B>,
<B>status</B>,
<B>watch</B>.
<P>

The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed.  Login shells
source <B>/etc/profile</B> followed by <B>$HOME/.profile</B>.  If the
<B>ENV</B> environment variable is set on invocation, <B>$ENV</B> is sourced
after the profile scripts.  The value of <B>ENV</B> is subjected to
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion
before being interpreted as a pathname.  Note that the <B>PRIVILEGED</B>
option also affects the execution of startup files.
<P>

The following options are set if the shell is invoked as <B>sh</B> or
<B>ksh</B>:
<B>NO_BAD_PATTERN</B>,
<B>NO_BANG_HIST</B>,
<B>NO_BG_NICE</B>,
<B>NO_EQUALS</B>,
<B>NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO</B>,
<B>GLOB_SUBST</B>,
<B>NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT</B>,
<B>NO_HUP</B>,
<B>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</B>,
<B>KSH_ARRAYS</B>,
<B>NO_MULTIOS</B>,
<B>NO_NOMATCH</B>,
<B>NO_NOTIFY</B>,
<B>POSIX_BUILTINS</B>,
<B>NO_PROMPT_PERCENT</B>,
<B>RM_STAR_SILENT</B>,
<B>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</B>,
<B>SH_GLOB</B>,
<B>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</B>,
<B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B>.
Additionally the <B>BSD_ECHO</B> and <B>IGNORE_BRACES</B>
options are set if zsh is invoked as <B>sh</B>.
Also, the
<B>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</B>,
<B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B>,
<B>PROMPT_BANG</B>,
<B>PROMPT_SUBST</B>
and
<B>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</B>
options are set if zsh is invoked as <B>ksh</B>.

<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RESTRICTED SHELL</H2>

When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts with the letter
`<B>r</B>' or the `<B>-r</B>' command line option is supplied at invocation, the
shell becomes restricted.  Emulation mode is determined after stripping the
letter `<B>r</B>' from the invocation name.  The following are disabled in
restricted mode:

</DL>
<P>

These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup files.  The
startup files should set up <B>PATH</B> to point to a directory of commands
which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment.  They may also
add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins.
<P>

Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the
<B>RESTRICTED</B> option.  This immediately enables all the restrictions
described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup
files.

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STARTUP/SHUTDOWN FILES</H2>

Commands are first read from <B>/etc/zshenv</B>; this cannot be overridden.
Subsequent behaviour is modified by the <B>RCS</B> and
<B>GLOBAL_RCS</B> options; the former affects all startup files, while the
second only affects those in the <B>/etc</B> directory.  If one of the options
is unset at any point, any subsequent startup file(s) of the corresponding
type will not be read.  It is also possible for a file in <B>$ZDOTDIR</B> to
re-enable <B>GLOBAL_RCS</B>. Both <B>RCS</B> and <B>GLOBAL_RCS</B> are set by
default.
<P>

Commands are then read from <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv</B>.
If the shell is a login shell, commands
are read from <B>/etc/zprofile</B> and then <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</B>.
Then, if the shell is interactive,
commands are read from <B>/etc/zshrc</B> and then <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</B>.
Finally, if the shell is a login shell, <B>/etc/zlogin</B> and
<B>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin</B> are read.
<P>

When a login shell exits, the files <B>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout</B> and then
<B>/etc/zlogout</B> are read.  This happens with either an explicit exit
via the <B>exit</B> or <B>logout</B> commands, or an implicit exit by reading
end-of-file from the terminal.  However, if the shell terminates due
to <B>exec</B>'ing another process, the logout files are not read.
These are also affected by the <B>RCS</B> and <B>GLOBAL_RCS</B> options.
Note also that the <B>RCS</B> option affects the saving of history files,
i.e. if <B>RCS</B> is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be
saved.
<P>

If <B>ZDOTDIR</B> is unset, <B>HOME</B> is used instead.
Those files listed above as being in <B>/etc</B> may be in another
directory, depending on the installation.
<P>

As <B>/etc/zshenv</B> is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that
it be kept as small as possible.  In particular, it is a good idea to
put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind
a test of the form `<B>if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...</B>' so that it will not

<P>

Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the <B>zcompile</B> builtin
command (see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshbuiltins.1.php">zshbuiltins</A></I>(1)).  If a compiled file exists (named for the original file plus the
<B>.zwc</B> extension) and it is newer than the original file, the compiled
file will be used instead.

<H2>SIMPLE COMMANDS &amp; PIPELINES</H2>

A <I>simple command</I> is a sequence of optional parameter
assignments followed by blank-separated words,
with optional redirections interspersed.
The first word is the command to be executed, and the remaining
words, if any, are arguments to the command.
If a command name is given, the parameter assignments modify
the environment of the command when it is executed.
The value of a simple command is its exit status,
or 128 plus the signal number if terminated by a signal.
For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>echo foo</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is a simple command with arguments.
<P>

A <I>pipeline</I> is either a simple command, or a sequence of two or more
simple commands where each command is separated from the next by `<B>|</B>'
or `<B>|&amp;</B>'.  Where commands are separated by `<B>|</B>', the standard
output of the first command is connected to the
standard input of the next.  `<B>|&amp;</B>' is shorthand for `<B>2&gt;&amp;1 |</B>', which
connects both the standard output and the standard error of the
command to the standard input of the next.  The value of a pipeline
is the value of the last command, unless the pipeline is preceded by
`<B>!</B>' in which case the value is the logical inverse of the value of the
last command.
For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>echo foo | sed 's/foo/bar/'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is a pipeline, where the output (`<B>foo</B>' plus a newline) of the first
command will be passed to the input of the second.
<P>

If a pipeline is preceded by `<B>coproc</B>', it is executed as a coprocess;
a two-way pipe is established between it and the parent shell.  The
shell can read from or write to the coprocess by means of the `<B>&gt;&amp;p</B>'
and `<B>&lt;&amp;p</B>' redirection operators or with `<B>print -p</B>' and `<B>read -p</B>'.
A pipeline cannot be preceded by both `<B>coproc</B>' and `<B>!</B>'.
If job control is active, the coprocess can be treated in other than input
and output as an ordinary background job.
<P>

A <I>sublist</I> is either a single pipeline, or a sequence of two or more
pipelines separated by `<B>&amp;&amp;</B>' or `<B>||</B>'.  If two pipelines are separated
by `<B>&amp;&amp;</B>', the second pipeline is executed only if the first succeeds
(returns a zero value).  If two pipelines are separated by `<B>||</B>', the
second is executed only if the first fails (returns a nonzero value).
Both operators have equal precedence and are left associative.
The value of the sublist is the value of the last pipeline executed.
For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>dmesg | grep panic &amp;&amp; print yes</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is a sublist consisting of two pipelines, the second just a simple command
which will be executed if and only if the <B>grep</B> command returns a zero
value.  If it does not, the value of the sublist is that return value, else
it is the value returned by the <B>print</B> (almost certainly zero).
<P>

A <I>list</I> is a sequence of zero or more sublists, in which each sublist
is terminated by `<B>;</B>', `<B>&amp;</B>', `<B>&amp;|</B>', `<B>&amp;!</B>', or a newline.
This terminator
may optionally be omitted from the last sublist in the list when the
list appears as a complex command inside `<B>(</B>...<B>)</B>'
or `<B>{</B>...<B>}</B>'.  When a
sublist is terminated by `<B>;</B>' or newline, the shell waits for it to
finish before executing the next sublist.  If a sublist is terminated
by a `<B>&amp;</B>', `<B>&amp;|</B>', or `<B>&amp;!</B>',
the shell executes the last pipeline in it in the background, and
does not wait for it to finish (note the difference from other shells
which execute the whole sublist in the background).
A backgrounded pipeline returns a status of zero.
<P>

More generally, a list can be seen as a set of any shell commands
whatsoever, including the complex commands below; this is implied wherever
the word `list' appears in later descriptions.  For example, the commands
in a shell function form a special sort of list.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PRECOMMAND MODIFIERS</H2>

A simple command may be preceded by a <I>precommand modifier</I>,
which will alter how the command is interpreted.  These modifiers are
shell builtin commands with the exception of <B>nocorrect</B> which is
a reserved word.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-</B>
The command is executed with a `<B>-</B>' prepended to its
<B>argv[0]</B> string.
<DT><B>noglob</B><DD>
Filename generation (globbing) is not performed on any of
the words.
<DT><B>nocorrect</B><DD>
Spelling correction is not done on any of the words.  This must appear
before any other precommand modifier, as it is interpreted immediately,
before any parsing is done.  It has no effect in non-interactive shells.
<DT><B>exec</B><DD>
The command is executed in the parent shell without forking.
<DT><B>command</B><DD>
The command word is taken to be the name of an external command,
rather than a shell function or builtin.
<DT><B>builtin</B><DD>
The command word is taken to be the name of a builtin command,
rather than a shell function or external command.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMPLEX COMMANDS</H2>

A <I>complex command</I> in zsh is one of the following:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>if</B> <I>list</I> <B>then</B> <I>list</I> [ <B>elif</B> <I>list</I> <B>then</B> <I>list</I> ] ... [ <B>else</B> <I>list</I> ] <B>fi</B>
The <B>if</B> <I>list</I> is executed, and if it returns a zero exit status,
the <B>then</B> <I>list</I> is executed.
Otherwise, the <B>elif</B> <I>list</I> is executed and if its value is zero,
the <B>then</B> <I>list</I> is executed.
If each <B>elif</B> <I>list</I> returns nonzero, the <B>else</B> <I>list</I> is executed.
<DT><B>for</B> <I>name</I> ... [ <B>in</B> <I>word</I> ... ] <I>term</I> <B>do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><DD>
where <I>term</I> is at least one newline or <B>;</B>.
Expand the list of <I>word</I>s, and set the parameter
<I>name</I> to each of them in turn, executing
<I>list</I> each time.  If the <B>in</B> <I>word</I> is omitted,
use the positional parameters instead of the <I>word</I>s.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

More than one parameter <I>name</I> can appear before the list of
<I>word</I>s.  If <I>N</I> <I>name</I>s are given, then on each execution of the
loop the next <B>N</B> <I>word</I>s are assigned to the corresponding
parameters.  If there are more <I>name</I>s than remaining <I>word</I>s, the
remaining parameters are each set to the empty string.  Execution of the
loop ends when there is no remaining <I>word</I> to assign to the first
<I>name</I>.  It is only possible for <B>in</B> to appear as the first <I>name</I>
in the list, else it will be treated as marking the end of the list.
</DL>

<DT><B>for ((</B> [<I>expr1</I>] <B>;</B> [<I>expr2</I>] <B>;</B> [<I>expr3</I>] <B>)) do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><DD>
The arithmetic expression <I>expr1</I> is evaluated first (see
the section `Arithmetic Evaluation').  The arithmetic expression
<I>expr2</I> is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to zero and
when non-zero, <I>list</I> is executed and the arithmetic expression
<I>expr3</I> evaluated.  If any expression is omitted, then it behaves
as if it evaluated to 1.
<DT><B>while</B> <I>list</I> <B>do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><DD>
Execute the <B>do</B> <I>list</I> as long as the <B>while</B> <I>list</I>
returns a zero exit status.
<DT><B>until</B> <I>list</I> <B>do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><DD>
Execute the <B>do</B> <I>list</I> as long as <B>until</B> <I>list</I>
returns a nonzero exit status.
<DT><B>repeat</B> <I>word</I> <B>do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><DD>
<I>word</I> is expanded and treated as an arithmetic expression,
which must evaluate to a number <I>n</I>.
<I>list</I> is then executed <I>n</I> times.
<DT><B>case</B> <I>word</I> <B>in</B> [ [<B>(</B>] <I>pattern</I> [ <B>|</B> <I>pattern</I> ] ... <B>)</B> <I>list</I> (<B>;;</B>|<B>;&amp;</B>) ] ... <B>esac</B><DD>
Execute the <I>list</I> associated with the first <I>pattern</I>
that matches <I>word</I>, if any.  The form of the patterns
is the same as that used for filename generation.  See
the section `Filename Generation'.
If the <I>list</I> that is executed is terminated with <B>;&amp;</B> rather than
<B>;;</B>, the following list is also executed.  This continues until either
a list is terminated with <B>;;</B> or the <B>esac</B> is reached.
<DT><B>select</B> <I>name</I> [ <B>in</B> <I>word</I> ... <I>term</I> ] <B>do</B> <I>list</I> <B>done</B><DD>
where <I>term</I> is one or more newline or <B>;</B> to terminate the <I>word</I>s.
Print the set of <I>word</I>s, each preceded by a number.
If the <B>in</B> <I>word</I> is omitted, use the positional parameters.
The <B>PROMPT3</B> prompt is printed and a line is read from the line editor
if the shell is interactive and that is active, or else standard input.
If this line consists of the
number of one of the listed <I>word</I>s, then the parameter <I>name</I>
is set to the <I>word</I> corresponding to this number.
If this line is empty, the selection list is printed again.
Otherwise, the value of the parameter <I>name</I> is set to null.
The contents of the line read from standard input is saved
in the parameter <B>REPLY</B>.  <I>list</I> is executed
for each selection until a break or end-of-file is encountered.
<DT><B>(</B> <I>list</I> <B>)</B><DD>
Execute <I>list</I> in a subshell.  Traps set by the <B>trap</B> builtin
are reset to their default values while executing <I>list</I>.
<DT><B>{</B> <I>list</I> <B>}</B><DD>
Execute <I>list</I>.
<DT>

<DT>
<DD>
<I>word</I> ... <B>()</B> [ <I>term</I> ] <I>command</I>
where <I>term</I> is one or more newline or <B>;</B>.
Define a function which is referenced by any one of <I>word</I>.
Normally, only one <I>word</I> is provided; multiple <I>word</I>s
are usually only useful for setting traps.
The body of the function is the <I>list</I> between
the <B>{</B> and <B>}</B>.  See the section `Functions'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the option <B>SH_GLOB</B> is set for compatibility with other shells, then
whitespace may appear between between the left and right parentheses when
there is a single <I>word</I>;  otherwise, the parentheses will be treated as
forming a globbing pattern in that case.
</DL>

<DT><B>time</B> [ <I>pipeline</I> ]<DD>
The <I>pipeline</I> is executed, and timing statistics are
reported on the standard error in the form specified
by the <B>TIMEFMT</B> parameter.
If <I>pipeline</I> is omitted, print statistics about the
shell process and its children.
<DT><B>[[</B> <I>exp</I> <B>]]</B><DD>
Evaluates the conditional expression <I>exp</I>
and return a zero exit status if it is true.
See the section `Conditional Expressions'
for a description of <I>exp</I>.

<H2>ALTERNATE FORMS FOR COMPLEX COMMANDS</H2>

Many of zsh's complex commands have alternate forms.  These particular
versions of complex commands should be considered deprecated and may be
removed in the future.  The versions in the previous section should be
preferred instead.
<P>

The short versions below only work if <I>sublist</I> is of the form `<B>{</B>
<I>list</I> <B>}</B>' or if the <B>SHORT_LOOPS</B> option is set.  For the <B>if</B>,
<B>while</B> and <B>until</B> commands, in both these cases the test part of the
loop must also be suitably delimited, such as by `<B>[[ ... ]]</B>' or `<B>((
... ))</B>', else the end of the test will not be recognized.  For the
<B>for</B>, <B>repeat</B>, <B>case</B> and <B>select</B> commands no such special form
for the arguments is necessary, but the other condition (the special form
of <I>sublist</I> or use of the <B>SHORT_LOOPS</B> option) still applies.
<P>

An alternate form of <B>if</B>.  The rules mean that
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<DT><B>if</B> <I>list</I> <I>sublist</I><DD>
A short form of the alternate `if'.  The same limitations on the form of
<I>list</I> apply as for the previous form.
<DT><B>for</B> <I>name</I> ... <B>(</B> <I>word</I> ... <B>)</B> <I>sublist</I><DD>
A short form of <B>for</B>.

A short form of the arithmetic <B>for</B> command.
<DT><B>foreach</B> <I>name</I> ... <B>(</B> <I>word</I> ... <B>)</B> <I>list</I> <B>end</B><DD>
Another form of <B>for</B>.
<DT><B>while</B> <I>list</I> <B>{</B> <I>list</I> <B>}</B><DD>
An alternative form of <B>while</B>.  Note the limitations on the form of
<I>list</I> mentioned above.
<DT><B>until</B> <I>list</I> <B>{</B> <I>list</I> <B>}</B><DD>
An alternative form of <B>until</B>.  Note the limitations on the form of
<I>list</I> mentioned above.
<DT><B>repeat</B> <I>word</I> <I>sublist</I><DD>
This is a short form of <B>repeat</B>.
<DT><B>case</B> <I>word</I> <B>{</B> [ [<B>(</B>] <I>pattern</I> [ <B>|</B> <I>pattern</I> ] ... <B>)</B> <I>list</I> (<B>;;</B>|<B>;&amp;</B>) ] ... <B>}</B><DD>
An alternative form of <B>case</B>.
<DT><B>select</B> <I>name</I> [ <B>in</B> <I>word</I> <I>term</I> ] <I>sublist</I><DD>
where <I>term</I> is at least one newline or <B>;</B>.
A short form of <B>select</B>.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RESERVED WORDS</H2>

The following words are recognized as reserved words when used as the first
word of a command unless quoted or disabled using <B>disable -r</B>:
<P>

<B>do done esac then elif else fi for case
if while function repeat time until
select coproc nocorrect foreach end ! [[ { }</B>
<P>

Additionally, `<B>}</B>' is recognized in any position if the <B>IGNORE_BRACES</B> option
is not set.
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMENTS</H2>

In noninteractive shells, or in interactive shells with the
<B>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</B> option set, a word beginning
with the third character of the <B>histchars</B> parameter
(`<B>#</B>' by default) causes that word and all the following
characters up to a newline to be ignored.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ALIASING</H2>

Every token in the shell input is checked to see if there
is an alias defined for it.
If so, it is replaced by the text of the alias if it is in command
position (if it could be the first word of a simple command),
or if the alias is global.
If the text ends with a space, the next word in the shell input
is treated as though it were in command position for purposes of alias
expansion.
An alias is defined using the <B>alias</B> builtin; global aliases
may be defined using the <B>-g</B> option to that builtin.
<P>

Alias expansion is done on the shell input before any
other expansion except history expansion.  Therefore,
if an alias is defined for the word <B>foo</B>, alias expansion
may be avoided by quoting part of the word, e.g. <B>\foo</B>.
But there is nothing to prevent an alias being defined
for <B>\foo</B> as well.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>QUOTING</H2>

A character may be <I>quoted</I> (that is, made
to stand for itself) by preceding it with a `<B>\</B>'.
`<B>\</B>' followed by a newline is ignored.
<P>

A string enclosed between `<B>$'</B>' and `<B>'</B>' is
processed the same way as the string arguments of the
<B>print</B> builtin, and the resulting string is considered to be
entirely quoted.  A literal `<B>'</B>' character can be included in the
string by using the `<B>\'</B>' escape.
<P>

All characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes (<B>''</B>) that
is not preceded by a `<B>$</B>' are quoted.  A single quote cannot appear
within single quotes unless the option <B>RC_QUOTES</B> is set, in which case
a pair of single quotes are turned into a single quote.  For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>print ''''</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

outputs nothing apart from a newline if <B>RC_QUOTES</B> is not set, but one
single quote if it is set.
<P>

Inside double quotes (<B>&quot;&quot;</B>), parameter and
command substitution occur, and `<B>\</B>' quotes the characters
`<B>\</B>', `<B>`</B>', `<B>&quot;</B>', and `<B>$</B>'.

<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REDIRECTION</H2>

If a command is followed by <B>&amp;</B>
and job control is not active,
then the default standard input
for the command is the empty file <B>/dev/null</B>.
Otherwise, the environment for the execution of a command contains the
file descriptors of the invoking shell as modified by
input/output specifications.
<P>

The following may appear anywhere in a simple command
or may precede or follow a complex command.
Expansion occurs before <I>word</I> or <I>digit</I>
is used except as noted below.
If the result of substitution on <I>word</I>
produces more than one filename,
redirection occurs for each
separate filename in turn.

<B>&amp;&gt;&gt;|</B> <I>word</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>&amp;&gt;&gt;!</B> <I>word</I>
Redirects both standard output and standard error (file descriptor 2)
in the manner of `<B>&gt;&gt;|</B> <I>word</I>'.
</DL>
<P>

If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the file
descriptor referred to is that specified by the digit
instead of the default 0 or 1.
The order in which redirections are specified is significant.
The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the
(<I>file descriptor</I>, <I>file</I>)
association at the time of evaluation.
For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
... <B>1&gt;</B><I>fname</I> <B>2&gt;&amp;1</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

first associates file descriptor 1 with file <I>fname</I>.
It then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file
descriptor 1 (that is, <I>fname</I>).
If the order of redirections were reversed,
file descriptor 2 would be associated
with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been)
and then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file <I>fname</I>.
<P>

The `<B>|&amp;</B>' command separator described in
<I>Simple Commands &amp; Pipelines</I> in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1)
is a shorthand for `<B>2&gt;&amp;1 |</B>'.
<P>

For output redirections only, if <I>word</I> is of the form
`<B>&gt;(</B><I>list</I><B>)</B>' then the output is piped to the command
represented by <I>list</I>.  See
<I>Process Substitution</I> in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1).
<A NAME="lbAZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MULTIOS</H2>

If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
its input to all the specified outputs, similar to <B>tee</B>,
provided the <B>MULTIOS</B> option is set, as it is by default.  Thus:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>date &gt;foo &gt;bar</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

writes the date to two files, named `<B>foo</B>' and `<B>bar</B>'.
Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>date &gt;foo | cat</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

writes the date to the file `<B>foo</B>', and also pipes it to cat.
<P>

If the <B>MULTIOS</B>
option is set, the word after a redirection operator is also subjected
to filename generation (globbing).  Thus
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>: &gt; *</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will truncate all files in the current directory,
assuming there's at least one.  (Without the <B>MULTIOS</B>
option, it would create an empty file called `<B>*</B>'.)
Similarly, you can do
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>echo exit 0 &gt;&gt; *.sh</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If the user tries to open a file descriptor for reading more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
all the specified inputs to its output in the order
specified, similar to <B>cat</B>,
provided the <B>MULTIOS</B> option is set.  Thus
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>sort &lt;foo &lt;fubar</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

or even
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>sort &lt;f{oo,ubar}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is equivalent to `<B>cat foo fubar | sort</B>'.
<P>

Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>cat bar | sort &lt;foo</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is equivalent to `<B>cat bar foo | sort</B>' (note the order of the inputs).
<P>

If the <B>MULTIOS</B> option is <I>un</I>set,
each redirection replaces the previous redirection for that file descriptor.
However, all files redirected to are actually opened, so
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>echo foo &gt; bar &gt; baz</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

when <B>MULTIOS</B> is unset will truncate bar, and write `<B>foo</B>' into baz.
<P>

There is a problem when an output multio is attached to an external
program.  A simple example shows this:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>cat file &gt;file1 &gt;file2
cat file1 file2</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Here, it is possible that the second `<B>cat</B>' will not display the full
contents of <B>file1</B> and <B>file2</B> (i.e. the original contents of
<B>file</B> repeated twice).
<P>

The reason for this is that the multios are spawned after the <B>cat</B>
process is forked from the parent shell, so the parent shell does not
wait for the multios to finish writing data.  This means the command as
shown can exit before <B>file1</B> and <B>file2</B> are completely written.
As a workaround, it is possible to run the <B>cat</B> process as part of a
job in the current shell:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>{ cat file } &gt;file &gt;file2</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Here, the <B>{</B><I>...</I><B>}</B> job will pause to wait for both files to be
written.
<P>

<A NAME="lbBA">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REDIRECTIONS WITH NO COMMAND</H2>

When a simple command consists of one or more redirection operators
and zero or more parameter assignments, but no command name, zsh can
behave in several ways.
<P>

If the parameter <B>NULLCMD</B> is not set or the option <B>CSH_NULLCMD</B> is
set, an error is caused.  This is the <B>csh</B> behavior and <B>CSH_NULLCMD</B>
is set by default when emulating <B>csh</B>.
<P>

If the option <B>SH_NULLCMD</B> is set, the builtin `<B>:</B>' is inserted as a
command with the given redirections.  This is the default when emulating
<B>sh</B> or <B>ksh</B>.
<P>

Otherwise, if the parameter <B>NULLCMD</B> is set, its value will be used as a
command with the given redirections.  If both <B>NULLCMD</B> and
<B>READNULLCMD</B> are set, then the value of the latter will be used instead
of that of the former when the redirection is an input.  The default for
<B>NULLCMD</B> is `<B>cat</B>' and for <B>READNULLCMD</B> is `<B>more</B>'. Thus
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>&lt; file</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

shows the contents of <B>file</B> on standard output, with paging if that is a
terminal.  <B>NULLCMD</B> and <B>READNULLCMD</B> may refer to shell functions.
<P>


<A NAME="lbBB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND EXECUTION</H2>

If a command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate
it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, the function
is invoked as described in the section `Functions'.  If there exists
a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
<P>

Otherwise, the shell searches each element of <B>$path</B> for a
directory containing an executable file by that name.  If the
search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an error message and returns
a nonzero exit status.
<P>

If execution fails because the file is not in executable format,
and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell
script.  <B>/bin/sh</B> is spawned to execute it.  If the program
is a file beginning with `<B>#!</B>', the remainder of the first line
specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell will
execute the specified interpreter on operating systems that do
not handle this executable format in the kernel.

<A NAME="lbBC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUNCTIONS</H2>

Shell functions are defined with the <B>function</B> reserved word or the
special syntax `<I>funcname</I> <B>()</B>'.
Shell functions are read in and stored internally.
Alias names are resolved when the function is read.
Functions are executed like commands with the arguments
passed as positional parameters.
(See the section `Command Execution'.)
<P>

Functions execute in the same process as the caller and
share all files
and present working directory with the
caller.  A trap on <B>EXIT</B> set inside a function
is executed after the function completes in the environment
of the caller.
<P>

The <B>return</B> builtin is used to return from function calls.
<P>

Function identifiers can be listed with the <B>functions</B> builtin.
Functions can be undefined with the <B>unfunction</B> builtin.
<A NAME="lbBD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>AUTOLOADING FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

A function can be marked as <I>undefined</I> using the <B>autoload</B> builtin
(or `<B>functions -u</B>' or `<B>typeset -fu</B>').  Such a function has no
body.  When the function is first executed, the shell searches for its
definition using the elements of the <B>fpath</B> variable.  Thus to define
functions for autoloading, a typical sequence is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>fpath=(~/myfuncs $fpath)
autoload myfunc1 myfunc2 ...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The usual alias expansion during reading will be suppressed if the
<B>autoload</B> builtin or its equivalent is given the option <B>-U</B>. This is
recommended for the use of functions supplied with the zsh distribution.
Note that for functions precompiled with the <B>zcompile</B> builtin command
the flag <B>-U</B> must be provided when the <B>.zwc</B> file is created, as the
corresponding information is compiled into the latter.
<P>

For each <I>element</I> in <B>fpath</B>, the shell looks for three possible
files, the newest of which is used to load the definition for the function:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>element</I><B>.zwc</B>
A file created with the <B>zcompile</B> builtin command, which is expected to
contain the definitions for all functions in the directory named
<I>element</I>.  The file is treated in the same manner as a directory
containing files for functions and is searched for the definition of the
function.   If the definition is not found, the search for a definition
proceeds with the other two possibilities described below.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <I>element</I> already includes a <B>.zwc</B> extension (i.e. the extension
was explicitly given by the user), <I>element</I> is searched for the
definition of the function without comparing its age to that of other
files; in fact, there does not need to be any directory named <I>element</I>
without the suffix.  Thus including an element such as
`<B>/usr/local/funcs.zwc</B>' in <B>fpath</B> will speed up the search for
functions, with the disadvantage that functions included must be explicitly
recompiled by hand before the shell notices any changes.
</DL>

<DT><I>element</I><B>/</B><I>function</I><B>.zwc</B><DD>
A file created with <B>zcompile</B>, which is expected to contain the
definition for <I>function</I>.  It may include other function definitions
as well, but those are neither loaded nor executed; a file found in this
way is searched <I>only</I> for the definition of <I>function</I>.
<DT><I>element</I><B>/</B><I>function</I><DD>
A file of zsh command text, taken to be the definition for <I>function</I>.
</DL>
<P>

In summary, the order of searching is, first, in the <I>parents of</I>
directories in <B>fpath</B> for the newer of either a compiled directory or
a directory in <B>fpath</B>; second, if more than one of these contains a
definition for the function that is sought, the leftmost in the <B>fpath</B>
is chosen; and third, within a directory, the newer of either a compiled
function or an ordinary function definition is used.
<P>

If the <B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> option is set, or the file contains only a
simple definition of the function, the file's contents will be executed.
This will normally define the function in question, but may also perform
initialization, which is executed in the context of the function execution,
and may therefore define local parameters.  It is an error if the function
is not defined by loading the file.
<P>

Otherwise, the function body (with no surrounding `<I>funcname</I><B>()
{</B><I>...</I><B>}</B>') is taken to be the complete contents of the file.  This
form allows the file to be used directly as an executable shell script.  If
processing of the file results in the function being re-defined, the
function itself is not re-executed.  To force the shell to perform
initialization and then call the function defined, the file should contain
initialization code (which will be executed then discarded) in addition to
a complete function definition (which will be retained for subsequent calls
to the function), and a call to the shell function, including any
arguments, at the end.
<P>

For example, suppose the autoload file <B>func</B> contains
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>func() { print This is func; }
print func is initialized
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

then `<B>func; func</B>' with <B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> set will produce both messages
on the first call, but only the message `<B>This is func</B>' on the second
and subsequent calls.  Without <B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> set, it will produce
the initialization message on the first call, and the other message on the
second and subsequent calls.
<P>

It is also possible to create a function that is not marked as autoloaded,
but which loads its own definition by searching <B>fpath</B>, by using
`<B>autoload -X</B>' within a shell function.  For example, the following are
equivalent:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>myfunc() {
  autoload -X
}
myfunc args...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

and
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>unfunction myfunc   # if myfunc was defined
autoload myfunc
myfunc args...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

In fact, the <B>functions</B> command outputs `<B>builtin autoload -X</B>' as
the body of an autoloaded function.  This is done so that
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>eval &quot;$(functions)&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

produces a reasonable result.  A true autoloaded function can be
identified by the presence of the comment `<B># undefined</B>' in the body,
because all comments are discarded from defined functions.
<P>

To load the definition of an autoloaded function <B>myfunc</B> without
executing <B>myfunc</B>, use:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>autoload +X myfunc</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<A NAME="lbBE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SPECIAL FUNCTIONS</H2>

The following functions, if defined, have special meaning to
the shell:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>chpwd</B>
Executed whenever the current working directory is changed.
<DT><B>periodic</B><DD>
If the parameter <B>PERIOD</B>
is set, this function is executed every <B>$PERIOD</B>
seconds, just before a prompt.
<DT><B>precmd</B><DD>
Executed before each prompt.
<DT><B>preexec</B><DD>
Executed just after a command has been read and is about to be
executed.  If the history mechanism is active (and the line was not
discarded from the history buffer), the string that the user typed is
passed as the first argument, otherwise it is an empty string.  The
actual command that will be executed (including expanded aliases) is
passed in two different forms: the second argument is a single-line,
size-limited version of the command (with things like function bodies
elided); the third argument contains the full text that is being
executed.
<DT><B>TRAP</B><I>NAL</I><DD>
If defined and non-null,
this function will be executed whenever the shell
catches a signal <B>SIG</B><I>NAL</I>, where <I>NAL</I> is a signal
name as specified for the <B>kill</B> builtin.
The signal number will be passed as the first parameter to the function.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If a function of this form is defined and null,
the shell and processes spawned by it will ignore <B>SIG</B><I>NAL</I>.
</DL>

<DT><B>TRAPDEBUG</B><DD>
Executed after each command.
<DT><B>TRAPEXIT</B><DD>
Executed when the shell exits,
or when the current function exits if defined inside a function.
<DT><B>TRAPZERR</B><DD>
Executed whenever a command has a non-zero exit status.  However, the
function is not executed if the command occurred in a sublist followed by
`<B>&amp;&amp;</B>' or `<B>||</B>'; only the final command in a sublist of this type
causes the trap to be executed.
</DL>
<P>

The functions beginning `<B>TRAP</B>' may alternatively be defined with the
<B>trap</B> builtin:  this may be preferable for some uses, as they are then
run in the environment of the calling process, rather than in their own
function environment.  Apart from the difference in calling procedure and
the fact that the function form appears in lists of functions, the forms
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>TRAPNAL() { 
 # code
}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

and
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>trap '
 # code
</B></PRE>

</DL>

<P>

are equivalent.

<A NAME="lbBF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>JOBS</H2>

If the <B>MONITOR</B> option is set,
an interactive shell associates a <I>job</I> with each pipeline.
It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the <B>jobs</B>
command, and assigns them small integer numbers.
When a job is started asynchronously with `<B>&amp;</B>',
the shell prints a line which looks like:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>[1] 1234</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number
1 and had one (top-level) process, whose process ID was 1234.
<P>

If a job is started with `<B>&amp;|</B>' or `<B>&amp;!</B>',
then that job is immediately disowned.  After startup, it
does not have a place in the job table, and is not subject
to the job control features described here.
<P>

If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the key
^Z (control-Z) which sends a <B>TSTP</B> signal to the current job:  this key
may be redefined by the <B>susp</B> option of the external <B>stty</B> command.
The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `suspended',
and print another prompt.  You can then manipulate the state of this job,
putting it in the background with the <B>bg</B> command, or run some other
commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with
the foreground command <B>fg</B>.  A ^Z takes effect immediately and
is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded
when it is typed.
<P>

A job being run in the background will suspend if it tries to read
from the terminal.
Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output,
but this can be disabled by giving the command `<B>stty tostop</B>'.
If you set this
tty option, then background jobs will suspend when they try to produce
output like they do when they try to read input.
<P>

When a command is suspended and continued later with the <B>fg</B> or
<B>wait</B> builtins, zsh restores tty modes that were in effect when it was
suspended.  This (intentionally) does not apply if the command is
continued via `<B>kill -CONT</B>', nor when it is continued with <B>bg</B>.
<P>

There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell.
A job can be referred to by the process ID of any process of the job
or by one of the following:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>%</B><I>number</I><DD>
The job with the given number.
<DT><B>%</B><I>string</I><DD>
Any job whose command line begins with <I>string</I>.
<DT><B>%?</B><I>string</I><DD>
Any job whose command line contains <I>string</I>.
<DT><B>%%</B><DD>
Current job.
<DT><B>%+</B><DD>
Equivalent to `<B>%%</B>'.
<DT><B>%-</B><DD>
Previous job.

</DL>
<P>

The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.
It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that
no further progress is possible.  If the <B>NOTIFY</B> option is not set,
it waits until just before it prints a prompt before it informs you.
<P>

When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes
triggers any trap set for <B>CHLD</B>.
<P>

When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or suspended, you will
be warned that `You have suspended (running) jobs'.
You may use the <B>jobs</B> command to see what they are.
If you do this or immediately try to
exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time; the suspended
jobs will be terminated, and the running jobs will be sent
a <B>SIGHUP</B> signal, if the <B>HUP</B> option is set.
<P>

To avoid having the shell terminate the running jobs, either
use the <B>nohup</B> command (see <I><A HREF="../man1/nohup.1.php">nohup</A></I>(1))
or the <B>disown</B> builtin.
<A NAME="lbBG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

The <B>INT</B> and <B>QUIT</B> signals for an invoked
command are ignored if the command is followed by
`<B>&amp;</B>' and the <B>MONITOR</B> option is not active.
Otherwise, signals have the values
inherited by the shell from its parent
(but see the <B>TRAP</B><I>NAL</I> special functions in the section `Functions').

<A NAME="lbBH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</H2>

The shell can perform integer and floating point arithmetic, either using
the builtin <B>let</B>, or via a substitution of the form <B>$((...))</B>.  For
integers, the shell is usually compiled to use 8-byte precision where this
is available, otherwise precision is 4 bytes.  This can be tested, for
example, by giving the command `<B>print - $(( 12345678901 ))</B>'; if the
number appears unchanged, the precision is at least 8 bytes.  Floating
point arithmetic is always double precision.
<P>

The <B>let</B> builtin command takes arithmetic expressions as arguments; each
is evaluated separately.  Since many of the arithmetic operators, as well
as spaces, require quoting, an alternative form is provided: for any
command which begins with a `<B>((</B>', all the characters until a
matching `<B>))</B>' are treated as a quoted expression and
arithmetic expansion performed as for an argument of <B>let</B>.  More
precisely, `<B>((</B><I>...</I><B>))</B>' is equivalent to
`<B>let &quot;</B><I>...</I><B>&quot;</B>'.  For example, the following statement
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>(( val = 2 + 1 ))</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is equivalent to
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>let &quot;val = 2 + 1&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

both assigning the value 3 to the shell variable <B>val</B> and returning a
zero status.
<P>

Integers can be in bases other than 10.
A leading `<B>0x</B>' or `<B>0X</B>' denotes hexadecimal.
Integers may also be of the form `<I>base</I><B>#</B><I>n</I>',
where <I>base</I> is a decimal number between two and thirty-six
representing the arithmetic base and <I>n</I>
is a number in that base (for example, `<B>16#ff</B>' is 255 in hexadecimal).
The <I>base</I><B>#</B> may also be omitted, in which case
base 10 is used.  For backwards compatibility the form
`<B>[</B><I>base</I><B>]</B><I>n</I>' is also accepted.
<P>

It is also possible to specify a base to be used for output in the form
`<B>[#</B><I>base</I><B>]</B>', for example `<B>[#16]</B>'.  This is used when
outputting arithmetical substitutions or when assigning to scalar
parameters, but an explicitly defined integer or floating point parameter
will not be affected.  If an integer variable is implicitly defined by an
arithmetic expression, any base specified in this way will be set as the
variable's output arithmetic base as if the option `<B>-i</B> <I>base</I>' to
the <B>typeset</B> builtin had been used.  The expression has no precedence
and if it occurs more than once in a mathematical expression, the last
encountered is used.  For clarity it is recommended that it appear at the
beginning of an expression.  As an example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>typeset -i 16 y
print $(( [#8] x = 32, y = 32 ))
print $x $y</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

outputs first `<B>8#40</B>', the rightmost value in the given output base, and
then `<B>8#40 16#20</B>', because <B>y</B> has been explicitly declared to
have output base 16, while <B>x</B> (assuming it does not already exist) is
implicitly typed by the arithmetic evaluation, where it acquires the output
base 8.
<P>

If the <B>C_BASES</B> option is set, hexadecimal numbers in the standard C
format, for example <B>0xFF</B> instead of the usual `<B>16#FF</B>'.  If the
option <B>OCTAL_ZEROES</B> is also set (it is not by default), octal numbers
will be treated similarly and hence appear as `<B>077</B>' instead of
`<B>8#77</B>'.  This option has no effect on the output of bases other than
hexadecimal and octal, and these formats are always understood on input.
<P>

When an output base is specified using the `<B>[#</B><I>base</I><B>]</B>' syntax,
an appropriate base prefix will be output if necessary, so that the value
output is valid syntax for input.  If the <B>#</B> is doubled, for example
`<B>[##16]</B>', then no base prefix is output.
<P>

Floating point constants are recognized by the presence of a decimal point
or an exponent.  The decimal point may be the first character of the
constant, but the exponent character <B>e</B> or <B>E</B> may not, as it will be
taken for a parameter name.
<P>

An arithmetic expression uses nearly the same syntax, precedence, and
associativity of expressions in C.
The following operators are supported (listed in decreasing order
of precedence):
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>+ - ! ~ ++ --</B><DD>
unary plus/minus, logical NOT, complement, {pre,post}{in,de}crement
<DT><B>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</B><DD>
bitwise shift left, right
<DT><B>&amp;</B><DD>
bitwise AND
<DT><B>^</B><DD>
bitwise XOR
<DT><B>|</B><DD>
bitwise OR
<DT><B>**</B><DD>
exponentiation
<DT><B>* / %</B><DD>
multiplication, division, modulus (remainder)
<DT><B>+ -</B><DD>
addition, subtraction
<DT><B>&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;=</B><DD>
comparison
<DT><B>== !=</B><DD>
equality and inequality
<DT><B>&amp;&amp;</B><DD>
logical AND
<DT><B>|| ^^</B><DD>
logical OR, XOR
<DT><B>? :</B><DD>
ternary operator
<DT><B>= += -= *= /= %= &amp;= ^= |= &lt;&lt;= &gt;&gt;= &amp;&amp;= ||= ^^= **=</B><DD>
assignment
<DT><B>,</B><DD>
comma operator

</DL>
<P>

The operators `<B>&amp;&amp;</B>', `<B>||</B>', `<B>&amp;&amp;=</B>', and `<B>||=</B>' are
short-circuiting, and only one of the latter two expressions in a ternary
operator is evaluated.  Note the precedence of the bitwise AND, OR,
and XOR operators.
<P>

Mathematical functions can be called with the syntax
`<I>func</I><B>(</B><I>args</I><B>)</B>', where the function decides
if the <I>args</I> is used as a string or a comma-separated list of
arithmetic expressions. The shell currently defines no mathematical
functions by default, but the module <B>zsh/mathfunc</B> may be loaded with
the <B>zmodload</B> builtin to provide standard floating point mathematical
functions.
<P>

An expression of the form `<B>##</B><I>x</I>' where <I>x</I> is any character
sequence such as `<B>a</B>', `<B>^A</B>', or `<B>\M-\C-x</B>' gives the ASCII
value of this character and an expression of the form `<B>#</B><I>foo</I>'
gives the ASCII value of the first character of the value of the
parameter <I>foo</I>.  Note that this is different from the expression
`<B>$#</B><I>foo</I>', a standard parameter substitution which gives the
length of the parameter <I>foo</I>.  `<B>#\</B>' is accepted instead of
`<B>##</B>', but its use is deprecated.
<P>

Named parameters and subscripted arrays can be referenced by name within an
arithmetic expression without using the parameter expansion syntax.  For
example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>((val2 = val1 * 2))</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

assigns twice the value of <B>$val1</B> to the parameter named <B>val2</B>.
<P>

An internal integer representation of a named parameter
can be specified with the <B>integer</B> builtin.
Arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each
assignment to a named parameter declared integer
in this manner.  Assigning a floating point number to an integer results in
rounding down to the next integer.
<P>

Likewise, floating point numbers can be declared with the <B>float</B>
builtin; there are two types, differing only in their output format, as
described for the <B>typeset</B> builtin.  The output format can be bypassed
by using arithmetic substitution instead of the parameter substitution,
i.e. `<B>${</B><I>float</I><B>}</B>' uses the defined format, but
`<B>$((</B><I>float</I><B>))</B>' uses a generic floating point
format.
<P>

Promotion of integer to floating point values is performed where
necessary.  In addition, if any operator which requires an integer
(`<B>~</B>', `<B>&amp;</B>', `<B>|</B>', `<B>^</B>', `<B>%</B>', `<B>&lt;&lt;</B>', `<B>&gt;&gt;</B>' and their
equivalents with assignment) is given a floating point argument, it will be
silently rounded down to the next integer.
<P>

Scalar variables can hold integer or floating point values at different
times; there is no memory of the numeric type in this case.
<P>

If a variable is first assigned in a numeric context without previously
being declared, it will be implicitly typed as <B>integer</B> or <B>float</B> and
retain that type either until the type is explicitly changed or until the
end of the scope.  This can have unforeseen consequences.  For example, in
the loop
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>for (( f = 0; f &lt; 1; f += 0.1 )); do
# use $f
done</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

if <B>f</B> has not already been declared, the first assignment will cause it
to be created as an integer, and consequently the operation `<B>f += 0.1</B>'
will always cause the result to be truncated to zero, so that the loop will
fail.  A simple fix would be to turn the initialization into `<B>f = 0.0</B>'.
It is therefore best to declare numeric variables with explicit types.

<DT><I>exp1</I> <B>||</B> <I>exp2</I><DD>
true if either <I>exp1</I> or <I>exp2</I> is true.
</DL>
<P>

Normal shell expansion is performed on the <I>file</I>, <I>string</I> and
<I>pattern</I> arguments, but the result of each expansion is constrained to
be a single word, similar to the effect of double quotes.  However, pattern
metacharacters are active for the <I>pattern</I> arguments; the patterns
are the same as those used for filename generation, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1), but there is no special behaviour
of `<B>/</B>' nor initial dots, and no glob qualifiers are allowed.
<P>

In each of the above expressions, if
<I>file</I> is of the form `<B>/dev/fd/</B><I>n</I>',
where <I>n</I> is an integer,
then the test applied to the open file whose
descriptor number is <I>n</I>,
even if the underlying system does not support
the <B>/dev/fd</B> directory.
<P>

In the forms which do numeric comparison, the expressions <I>exp</I>
undergo arithmetic expansion as if they were enclosed in <B>$((...))</B>.
<P>

For example, the following:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>[[ ( -f foo || -f bar ) &amp;&amp; $report = y* ]] &amp;&amp; print File exists.</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

tests if either file <B>foo</B> or file <B>bar</B> exists, and if so, if the
value of the parameter <B>report</B> begins with `<B>y</B>'; if the complete
condition is true, the message `<B>File exists.</B>' is printed.

<A NAME="lbBJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROMPT EXPANSION</H2>

Prompt sequences undergo a special form of expansion.  This type of expansion
is also available using the <B>-P</B> option to the <B>print</B> builtin.
<P>

If the <B>PROMPT_SUBST</B> option is set, the prompt string is first subjected to
<I>parameter expansion</I>,
<I>command substitution</I> and
<I>arithmetic expansion</I>.
See
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1).
<P>
Certain escape sequences may be recognised in the prompt string.
<P>

If the <B>PROMPT_BANG</B> option is set, a `<B>!</B>' in the prompt is replaced
by the current history event number.  A literal `<B>!</B>' may then be
represented as `<B>!!</B>'.
<P>

If the <B>PROMPT_PERCENT</B> option is set, certain escape sequences that
start with `<B>%</B>' are expanded.
Some escapes take an optional integer argument, which
should appear between the `<B>%</B>' and the next character of the
sequence.  The following escape sequences are recognized:

<DT><B>%M</B><DD>
The full machine hostname.
<DT><B>%m</B><DD>
The hostname up to the first `<B>.</B>'.
An integer may follow the `<B>%</B>' to specify
how many components of the hostname are desired.  With a negative integer,
trailing components of the hostname are shown.
<DT><B>%n</B><DD>
<B>$USERNAME</B>.

<B>%#</B>
A `<B>#</B>' if the shell is running with privileges, a `<B>%</B>' if not.
Equivalent to `<B>%(!.#.%%)</B>'.
The definition of `privileged', for these purposes, is that either the
effective user ID is zero, or, if POSIX.1e capabilities are supported, that
at least one capability is raised in either the Effective or Inheritable
capability vectors.
<DT><B>%?</B><DD>
The return code of the last command executed just before the prompt.
<DT><B>%_</B><DD>
The status of the parser, i.e. the shell constructs (like `<B>if</B>' and
`<B>for</B>') that have been started on the command line. If given an integer
number that many strings will be printed; zero or negative or no integer means
print as many as there are.  This is most useful in prompts <B>PS2</B> for
continuation lines and <B>PS4</B> for debugging with the <B>XTRACE</B> option; in
the latter case it will also work non-interactively.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%d</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%/</B>
Present working directory (<B>$PWD</B>).  If an integer follows the `<B>%</B>',
it specifies a number of trailing components of <B>$PWD</B> to show; zero
means the whole path.  A negative integer specifies leading components,
i.e. <B>%-1d</B> specifies the first component.
<DT><B>%~</B><DD>
As <B>%d</B> and <B>%/</B>, but if <B>$PWD</B> has a named directory as its prefix,
that part is replaced by a `<B>~</B>' followed by the name of the directory.
If it starts with <B>$HOME</B>, that part is replaced by a `<B>~</B>'.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%h</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%!</B>
Current history event number.
<DT><B>%i</B><DD>
The line number currently being executed in the script, sourced file, or
shell function given by <B>%N</B>.  This is most useful for debugging as part
of <B>$PS4</B>.
<DT><B>%j</B><DD>
The number of jobs.
<DT><B>%L</B><DD>
The current value of <B>$SHLVL</B>.
<DT><B>%N</B><DD>
The name of the script, sourced file, or shell function that zsh is
currently executing, whichever was started most recently.  If there is
none, this is equivalent to the parameter <B>$0</B>.  An integer may follow
the `<B>%</B>' to specify a number of trailing path components to show; zero
means the full path.  A negative integer specifies leading components.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%c</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%.</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%C</B>
Trailing component of <B>$PWD</B>.
An integer may follow the `<B>%</B>' to get more than one component.
Unless `<B>%C</B>' is used, tilde contraction is performed first.  These are
deprecated as <B>%c</B> and <B>%C</B> are equivalent to <B>%1~</B> and <B>%1/</B>,
respectively, while explicit positive integers have the same effect as for
the latter two sequences.

<DT>
<DD>
<B>%&gt;</B><I>string</I><B>&gt;</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%[</B><I>xstring</I><B>]</B>
Specifies truncation behaviour for the remainder of the prompt string.
The third, deprecated, form is equivalent to `<B>%</B><I>xstringx</I>',
i.e. <I>x</I> may be `<B>&lt;</B>' or `<B>&gt;</B>'.
The numeric argument, which in the third form may appear immediately
after the `<B>[</B>', specifies the maximum permitted length of
the various strings that can be displayed in the prompt.
The <I>string</I> will be displayed in
place of the truncated portion of any string; note this does not
undergo prompt expansion.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The forms with `<B>&lt;</B>' truncate at the left of the string,
and the forms with `<B>&gt;</B>' truncate at the right of the string.
For example, if the current directory is `<B>/home/pike</B>',
the prompt `<B>%8&lt;..&lt;%/</B>' will expand to `<B>..e/pike</B>'.
In this string, the terminating character (`<B>&lt;</B>', `<B>&gt;</B>' or `<B>]</B>'),
or in fact any character, may be quoted by a preceding `<B>\</B>'; note
when using <B>print -P</B>, however, that this must be doubled as the
string is also subject to standard <B>print</B> processing, in addition
to any backslashes removed by a double quoted string:  the worst case
is therefore `<B>print -P &quot;%&lt;\\\\&lt;&lt;...&quot;</B>'.
<P>

If the <I>string</I> is longer than the specified truncation length,
it will appear in full, completely replacing the truncated string.
<P>

The part of the prompt string to be truncated runs to the end of the
string, or to the end of the next enclosing group of the `<B>%(</B>'
construct, or to the next truncation encountered at the same grouping
level (i.e. truncations inside a `<B>%(</B>' are separate), which
ever comes first.  In particular, a truncation with argument zero
(e.g. `<B>%&lt;&lt;</B>') marks the end of the range of the string to be
truncated while turning off truncation from there on. For example, the
prompt '%10&lt;...&lt;%~%&lt;&lt;%# ' will print a truncated representation of the
current directory, followed by a `<B>%</B>' or `<B>#</B>', followed by a
space.  Without the `<B>%&lt;&lt;</B>', those two characters would be included
in the string to be truncated.

zshexpn - zsh expansion and substitution

<A NAME="lbBR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The following types of expansions are performed in the indicated order in
five steps:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>History Expansion</I>
This is performed only in interactive shells.
<DT><I>Alias Expansion</I><DD>
Aliases are expanded immediately before the command line is parsed as
explained
under Aliasing in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1).
<DT>
<DD>
<I>Process Substitution</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>Parameter Expansion</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>Command Substitution</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>Arithmetic Expansion</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>Brace Expansion</I>
These five are performed in one step in left-to-right fashion.  After
these expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters `<B>\</B>',
`<B>'</B>' and `<B>&quot;</B>' are removed.
<DT><I>Filename Expansion</I><DD>
If the <B>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</B> option is set, the order of expansion is
modified for compatibility with <B>sh</B> and <B>ksh</B>.  In that case
<I>filename expansion</I> is performed immediately after <I>alias expansion</I>,
preceding the set of five expansions mentioned above.
<DT><I>Filename Generation</I><DD>
This expansion, commonly referred to as <B>globbing</B>, is always done last.
</DL>
<P>

The following sections explain the types of expansion in detail.
<P>

<A NAME="lbBS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORY EXPANSION</H2>

History expansion allows you to use words from previous command
lines in the command line you are typing.  This simplifies spelling
corrections and the repetition of complicated commands or arguments.
Immediately before execution, each command is saved in the history list,
the size of which is controlled by the <B>HISTSIZE</B> parameter.  The one
most recent command is always retained in any case.  Each saved command in
the history list is called a history <I>event</I> and is assigned a number,
beginning with 1 (one) when the shell starts up.  The history number that
you may see in your prompt (see
Prompt Expansion in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1)) is the number that is to be assigned to the <I>next</I> command.
<P>

<A NAME="lbBT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Overview</H3>

A history expansion begins with the first character of the <B>histchars</B>
parameter, which is `<B>!</B>' by default, and may occur anywhere on the
command line; history expansions do not nest.  The `<B>!</B>' can be escaped
with `<B>\</B>' or can be enclosed between a pair of single quotes (<B>''</B>)
to suppress its special meaning.  Double quotes will <I>not</I> work for
this.  Following this history character is an optional event designator
(see the section `Event Designators') and then an optional word
designator (the section `Word Designators'); if neither of these designators is
present, no history expansion occurs.
<P>

Input lines containing history expansions are echoed after being expanded,
but before any other expansions take place and before the command is
executed.  It is this expanded form that is recorded as the history event
for later references.
<P>

By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to the
same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if it
is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the previous
command.
However, if the option <B>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</B> is set, then every history
reference with no event specification <I>always</I> refers to the previous
command.
<P>

For example, `<B>!</B>' is the event designator for the previous command, so
`<B>!!:1</B>' always refers to the first word of the previous command, and
`<B>!!$</B>' always refers to the last word of the previous command.  With
<B>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</B> set, then `<B>!:1</B>' and `<B>!$</B>' function in the
same manner as `<B>!!:1</B>' and `<B>!!$</B>', respectively.  Conversely, if
<B>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</B> is unset, then `<B>!:1</B>' and `<B>!$</B>' refer to the
first and last words, respectively, of the same event referenced by the
nearest other history reference preceding them on the current command
line, or to the previous command if there is no preceding reference.
<P>

The character sequence `<B>^</B><I>foo</I><B>^</B><I>bar</I>' (where `<B>^</B>' is
actually the second character of the <B>histchars</B> parameter)
repeats the last command, replacing the string <I>foo</I> with <I>bar</I>.
More precisely, the sequence `<B>^</B><I>foo</I><B>^</B><I>bar</I><B>^</B>' is
synonymous with `<B>!!:s</B><B>^</B><I>foo</I><B>^</B><I>bar</I><B>^</B>', hence other
modifiers (see the section `Modifiers') may follow the final `<B>^</B>'.
<P>

If the shell encounters the character sequence `<B>!&quot;</B>'
in the input, the history mechanism is temporarily disabled until
the current list (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1)) is fully parsed.  The `<B>!&quot;</B>' is removed from the input, and any
subsequent `<B>!</B>' characters have no special significance.
<P>

A less convenient but more comprehensible form of command history support
is provided by the <B>fc</B> builtin.
<A NAME="lbBU">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Event Designators</H3>

An event designator is a reference to a command-line entry in the history
list.  In the list below, remember that the initial <B>`!'</B> in each item
may be changed to another character by setting the <B>histchars</B>
parameter.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>!</B>
Start a history expansion, except when followed by a blank, newline,
`<B>=</B>' or `<B>(</B>'.  If followed immediately by a word designator
(see the section `Word Designators'), this forms a history reference
with no event designator (see the section `Overview').
<DT><B>!!</B><DD>
Refer to the previous command.
By itself, this expansion
repeats the previous command.
<DT><B>!</B><I>n</I><DD>
Refer to command-line <I>n</I>.
<DT><B>!-</B><I>n</I><DD>
Refer to the current command-line minus <I>n</I>.
<DT><B>!</B><I>str</I><DD>
Refer to the most recent command starting with <I>str</I>.
<DT><B>!?</B><I>str</I>[<B>?</B>]<DD>
Refer to the most recent command containing <I>str</I>.  The trailing
`<B>?</B>' is necessary if this reference is to be followed by a modifier or
followed by any text that is not to be considered part of <I>str</I>.
<DT><B>!#</B><DD>
Refer to the current command line typed in so far.  The line is
treated as if it were complete up to and including the word before the
one with the `<B>!#</B>' reference.
<DT><B>!{</B>...<B>}</B><DD>
Insulate a history reference from adjacent characters (if necessary).
</DL>
<A NAME="lbBV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Word Designators</H3>

A word designator indicates which word or words of a given command line are
to be included in a history reference.  A `<B>:</B>' usually
separates the event specification from the word designator.
It may be omitted only if the word designator begins with a
`<B>^</B>', `<B>$</B>', `<B>*</B>', `<B>-</B>' or `<B>%</B>'.
Word designators include:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>0</B><DD>
The first input word (command).
<DT><I>n</I><DD>
The <I>n</I>th argument.
<DT><B>^</B><DD>
The first argument.  That is, <B>1</B>.
<DT><B>$</B><DD>
The last argument.
<DT><B>%</B><DD>
The word matched by (the most recent) <B>?</B><I>str</I> search.
<DT><I>x</I><B>-</B><I>y</I><DD>
A range of words; <I>x</I> defaults to <B>0</B>.
<DT><B>*</B><DD>
All the arguments, or a null value if there are none.
<DT><I>x</I><B>*</B><DD>
Abbreviates `<I>x</I><B>-$</B>'.
<DT><I>x</I><B>-</B><DD>
Like `<I>x</I><B>*</B>' but omitting word <B>$</B>.

</DL>
<P>

Note that a `<B>%</B>' word designator works only when used in one of
`<B>!%</B>', `<B>!:%</B>' or `<B>!?</B><I>str</I><B>?:%</B>', and only when used after a
<B>!?</B> expansion (possibly in an earlier command).  Anything else results
in an error, although the error may not be the most obvious one.
<A NAME="lbBW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Modifiers</H3>

After the optional word designator, you can add
a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers,
each preceded by a `<B>:</B>'.  These modifiers also work on the result
of <I>filename generation</I> and <I>parameter expansion</I>, except where
noted.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>h</B>
Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.  This works
like `<B>dirname</B>'.
<DT><B>r</B><DD>
Remove a filename extension of the form `<B>.</B><I>xxx</I>', leaving
the root name.
<DT><B>e</B><DD>
Remove all but the extension.
<DT><B>t</B><DD>
Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.  This works
like `<B>basename</B>'.
<DT><B>p</B><DD>
Print the new command but do not execute it.  Only works with history
expansion.
<DT><B>q</B><DD>
Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.  Works
with history expansion and parameter expansion, though for parameters
it is only useful if the resulting text is to be re-evaluated such as
by <B>eval</B>.
<DT><B>Q</B><DD>
Remove one level of quotes from the substituted words.
<DT><B>x</B><DD>
Like <B>q</B>, but break into words at whitespace.  Does not work with
parameter expansion.
<DT><B>l</B><DD>
Convert the words to all lowercase.
<DT><B>u</B><DD>
Convert the words to all uppercase.
<DT><B>s/</B><I>l</I><B>/</B><I>r</I>[<B>/</B>]<DD>
Substitute <I>r</I> for <I>l</I> as described below.
Unless preceded immediately by a <B>g</B>, with no colon between,
the substitution is done only for the
first string that matches <I>l</I>.  For arrays and for filename
generation, this applies to each word of the expanded text.
<DT><B>&amp;</B><DD>
Repeat the previous <B>s</B> substitution.  Like <B>s</B>, may be preceded
immediately by a <B>g</B>.  In parameter expansion the <B>&amp;</B> must appear
inside braces, and in filename generation it must be quoted with a
backslash.
</DL>
<P>

The <B>s/l/r/</B> substitution works as follows.  The left-hand side of
substitutions are not regular expressions, but character strings.  Any
character can be used as the delimiter in place of `<B>/</B>'.  A
backslash quotes the delimiter character.  The character `<B>&amp;</B>', in
the right-hand-side <I>r</I>, is replaced by the text from the
left-hand-side <I>l</I>.  The `<B>&amp;</B>' can be quoted with a backslash.  A
null <I>l</I> uses the previous string either from the previous <I>l</I>
or from the contextual scan string <I>s</I> from `<B>!?</B><I>s</I>'.  You can
omit the rightmost delimiter if a newline immediately follows <I>r</I>;
the rightmost `<B>?</B>' in a context scan can similarly be omitted.
Note the same record of the last <I>l</I> and <I>r</I> is maintained
across all forms of expansion.
<P>

The following <B>f</B>, <B>F</B>, <B>w</B> and <B>W</B> modifiers work only with
parameter expansion and filename generation.  They are listed here to
provide a single point of reference for all modifiers.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>f</B>
Repeats the immediately (without a colon) following modifier until the
resulting word doesn't change any more.
<DT><B>F:</B><I>expr</I><B>:</B><DD>
Like <B>f</B>, but repeats only <I>n</I> times if the expression
<I>expr</I> evaluates to <I>n</I>.  Any character can be used instead of
the `<B>:</B>'; if `<B>(</B>', `<B>[</B>', or `<B>{</B>'
is used as the opening delimiter,
the closing delimiter should be '<B>)</B>', `<B>]</B>', or `<B>}</B>',
respectively.
<DT><B>w</B><DD>
Makes the immediately following modifier work on each word in the
string.
<DT><B>W:</B><I>sep</I><B>:</B><DD>
Like <B>w</B> but words are considered to be the parts of the string
that are separated by <I>sep</I>. Any character can be used instead of
the `<B>:</B>'; opening parentheses are handled specially, see above.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbBX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PROCESS SUBSTITUTION</H2>

Each command argument of the form
`<B>&lt;(</B><I>list</I><B>)</B>',
`<B>&gt;(</B><I>list</I><B>)</B>' or
`<B>=(</B><I>list</I><B>)</B>'
is subject to process substitution.
In the case of the <B>&lt;</B> or <B>&gt;</B> forms, the shell runs process
<I>list</I> asynchronously.  If the system supports the <B>/dev/fd</B>
mechanism, the command argument is the name of the device file
corresponding to a file descriptor; otherwise, if the system supports named
pipes (FIFOs), the command argument will be a named pipe.  If the form with
<B>&gt;</B> is selected then writing on this special file will provide input for
<I>list</I>.  If <B>&lt;</B> is used, then the file passed as an argument will
be connected to the output of the <I>list</I> process.  For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>paste &lt;(cut -f1</B> <I>file1</I><B>) &lt;(cut -f3</B> <I>file2</I><B>) |
tee &gt;(</B><I>process1</I><B>) &gt;(</B><I>process2</I><B>) &gt;/dev/null</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

cuts fields 1 and 3 from the files <I>file1</I> and <I>file2</I> respectively,
pastes the results together, and sends it to the processes
<I>process1</I> and <I>process2</I>.
<P>

If <B>=(</B><I>...</I><B>)</B> is used instead of
<B>&lt;(</B><I>...</I><B>)</B>,
then the file passed as an argument will be the name
of a temporary file containing the output of the <I>list</I>
process.  This may be used instead of the <B>&lt;</B>
form for a program that expects to lseek (see <I><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.php">lseek</A></I>(2))
on the input file.
<P>

The <B>=</B> form is useful as both the <B>/dev/fd</B> and the named pipe
implementation of <B>&lt;(</B><I>...</I><B>)</B> have drawbacks.  In 
the former case, some programmes may automatically close the file
descriptor in question before examining the file on the command line,
particularly if this is necessary for security reasons such as when the
programme is running setuid.  In the second case, if the
programme does not actually open the file, the subshell attempting to read
from or write to the pipe will (in a typical implementation, different
operating systems may have different behaviour) block for ever and have to
be killed explicitly.  In both cases, the shell actually supplies the
information using a pipe, so that programmes that expect to lseek
(see <I><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.php">lseek</A></I>(2)) on the file will not work.
<P>

Also note that the previous example can be more compactly and
efficiently written (provided the <B>MULTIOS</B> option is set) as:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>paste &lt;(cut -f1</B> <I>file1</I><B>) &lt;(cut -f3</B> <I>file2</I><B>)</B> \ 
<B>&gt; &gt;(</B><I>process1</I><B>) &gt; &gt;(</B><I>process2</I><B>)</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The shell uses pipes instead of FIFOs to implement the latter
two process substitutions in the above example.
<P>

There is an additional problem with <B>&gt;(</B><I>process</I><B>)</B>; when
this is attached to an external command, the parent shell does not wait
for <I>process</I> to finish and hence an immediately following command
cannot rely on the results being complete.  The problem and solution are
the same as described in the section <I>MULTIOS</I> in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1).  Hence in a simplified
version of the example above:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>paste &lt;(cut -f1</B> <I>file1</I><B>) &lt;(cut -f3</B> <I>file2</I><B>)</B> <B>&gt; &gt;(</B><I>process</I><B>)</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

(note that no <B>MULTIOS</B> are involved), <I>process</I> will be run
asynchronously.  The workaround is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>{ paste &lt;(cut -f1</B> <I>file1</I><B>) &lt;(cut -f3</B> <I>file2</I><B>) }</B> <B>&gt; &gt;(</B><I>process</I><B>)</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The extra processes here are
spawned from the parent shell which will wait for their completion.
<P>

<A NAME="lbBY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PARAMETER EXPANSION</H2>

The character `<B>$</B>' is used to introduce parameter expansions.
See
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1)
for a description of parameters, including arrays, associative arrays,
and subscript notation to access individual array elements.
<P>

Note in particular the fact that words of unquoted parameters are not
automatically split on whitespace unless the option <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> is
set; see references to this option below for more details.  This is an
important difference from other shells.
<P>

In the expansions discussed below that require a pattern, the form of
the pattern is the same as that used for filename generation;
see the section `Filename Generation'.  Note that these patterns, along with
the replacement text of any substitutions, are themselves subject to
parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
In addition to the following operations, the colon modifiers described in
the section `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion' can be
applied:  for example, <B>${i:s/foo/bar/}</B> performs string
substitution on the expansion of parameter <B>$i</B>.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>}</B>
The value, if any, of the parameter <I>name</I> is substituted.
The braces are required if the expansion is to be followed by
a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to be interpreted
as part of <I>name</I>.  In addition, more complicated forms of substitution
usually require the braces to be present; exceptions, which only apply if
the option <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B> is not set, are a single subscript or any colon
modifiers appearing after the name, or any of the characters `<B>^</B>',
`<B>=</B>', `<B>~</B>', `<B>#</B>' or `<B>+</B>' appearing before the name, all of
which work with or without braces.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <I>name</I> is an array parameter, and the <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B> option is not
set, then the value of each
element of <I>name</I> is substituted, one element per word.  Otherwise, the
expansion results in one word only; with <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B>, this is the first
element of an array.  No field splitting is done on the result unless the
<B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> option is set.
</DL>

<DT><B>${+</B><I>name</I><B>}</B><DD>
If <I>name</I> is the name of a set parameter `<B>1</B>' is substituted,
otherwise `<B>0</B>' is substituted.
<DT><B>${</B><I>name</I><B>:-</B><I>word</I><B>}</B><DD>
If <I>name</I> is set and is non-null then substitute its
value; otherwise substitute <I>word</I>. If <I>name</I> is
missing, substitute <I>word</I>.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>:=</B><I>word</I><B>}</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>::=</B><I>word</I><B>}</B>
In the first form, if <I>name</I> is unset or is null then
set it to <I>word</I>; in the second form, unconditionally
set <I>name</I> to <I>word</I>.  In both forms, the value of
the parameter is then substituted.
<DT><B>${</B><I>name</I><B>:?</B><I>word</I><B>}</B><DD>
If <I>name</I> is set and is non-null then substitute
its value; otherwise, print <I>word</I> and exit from the shell.
Interactive shells instead return to the prompt.
If <I>word</I> is omitted, then a standard message is printed.
<DT><B>${</B><I>name</I><B>:+</B><I>word</I><B>}</B><DD>
If <I>name</I> is set and is non-null then substitute
<I>word</I>; otherwise substitute nothing.
</DL>
<P>

If the colon is omitted from one of the above expressions
containing a colon, then the shell only checks whether
<I>name</I> is set, not whether its value is null.
<P>

In the following expressions, when <I>name</I> is an array and
the substitution is not quoted, or if the `<B>(@)</B>' flag or the
<I>name</I><B>[@]</B> syntax is used, matching and replacement is
performed on each array element separately.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>#</B><I>pattern</I><B>}</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>##</B><I>pattern</I><B>}</B>
If the <I>pattern</I> matches the beginning of the value of
<I>name</I>, then substitute the value of <I>name</I> with
the matched portion deleted; otherwise, just
substitute the value of <I>name</I>.  In the first
form, the smallest matching pattern is preferred;
in the second form, the largest matching pattern is
preferred.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>%</B><I>pattern</I><B>}</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>%%</B><I>pattern</I><B>}</B>
If the <I>pattern</I> matches the end of the value of
<I>name</I>, then substitute the value of <I>name</I> with
the matched portion deleted; otherwise, just
substitute the value of <I>name</I>.  In the first
form, the smallest matching pattern is preferred;
in the second form, the largest matching pattern is
preferred.
<DT><B>${</B><I>name</I><B>:#</B><I>pattern</I><B>}</B><DD>
If the <I>pattern</I> matches the value of <I>name</I>, then substitute
the empty string; otherwise, just substitute the value of <I>name</I>.
If <I>name</I> is an array
the matching array elements are removed (use the `<B>(M)</B>' flag to
remove the non-matched elements).
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>/</B><I>pattern</I><B>/</B><I>repl</I><B>}</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>//</B><I>pattern</I><B>/</B><I>repl</I><B>}</B>
Replace the longest possible match of <I>pattern</I> in the expansion of
parameter <I>name</I> by string <I>repl</I>.  The first form
replaces just the first occurrence, the second form all occurrences.
Both <I>pattern</I> and <I>repl</I> are subject to double-quoted substitution,
so that expressions like <B>${name/$opat/$npat}</B> will work, but note the
usual rule that pattern characters in <B>$opat</B> are not treated specially
unless either the option <B>GLOB_SUBST</B> is set, or <B>$opat</B> is instead
substituted as <B>${~opat}</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>pattern</I> may begin with a `<B>#</B>', in which case the
<I>pattern</I> must match at the start of the string, or `<B>%</B>', in
which case it must match at the end of the string.  The <I>repl</I> may
be an empty string, in which case the final `<B>/</B>' may also be omitted.
To quote the final `<B>/</B>' in other cases it should be preceded by a
single backslash; this is not necessary if the
`<B>/</B>' occurs inside a substituted parameter.  Note also that the `<B>#</B>'
and `<B>%</B>' are not active if they occur inside a substituted parameter,
even at the start.
<P>

The first `<B>/</B>' may be preceded by a `<B>:</B>', in which case the match
will only succeed if it matches the entire word.  Note also the
effect of the <B>I</B> and <B>S</B> parameter expansion flags below; however,
the flags <B>M</B>, <B>R</B>, <B>B</B>, <B>E</B> and <B>N</B> are not useful.
<P>

For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>foo=&quot;twinkle twinkle little star&quot; sub=&quot;t*e&quot; rep=&quot;spy&quot;
print ${foo//${~sub}/$rep}
print ${(S)foo//${~sub}/$rep}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Here, the `<B>~</B>' ensures that the text of <B>$sub</B> is treated as a
pattern rather than a plain string.  In the first case, the longest
match for <B>t*e</B> is substituted and the result is `<B>spy star</B>',
while in the second case, the shortest matches are taken and the
result is `<B>spy spy lispy star</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>${#</B><I>spec</I><B>}</B><DD>
If <I>spec</I> is one of the above substitutions, substitute
the length in characters of the result instead of
the result itself.  If <I>spec</I> is an array expression,
substitute the number of elements of the result.
Note that `<B>^</B>', `<B>=</B>', and `<B>~</B>', below, must appear
to the left of `<B>#</B>' when these forms are combined.
<DT><B>${^</B><I>spec</I><B>}</B><DD>
Turn on the <B>RC_EXPAND_PARAM</B> option for the
evaluation of <I>spec</I>; if the `<B>^</B>' is doubled, turn it off.
When this option is set, array expansions of the form
<I>foo</I><B>${</B><I>xx</I><B>}</B><I>bar</I>,
where the parameter <I>xx</I>
is set to <B>(</B><I>a b c</I><B>)</B>, are substituted with
`<I>fooabar foobbar foocbar</I>' instead of the default
`<I>fooa b cbar</I>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Internally, each such expansion is converted into the
equivalent list for brace expansion.  E.g., <B>${^var}</B> becomes
<B>{$var[1],$var[2],</B>...<B>}</B>, and is processed as described in
the section `Brace Expansion' below.
If word splitting is also in effect the
<B>$var[</B><I>N</I><B>]</B> may themselves be split into different list
elements.
</DL>

<DT><B>${=</B><I>spec</I><B>}</B><DD>
Perform word splitting using the rules for <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> during the
evaluation of <I>spec</I>, but regardless of whether the parameter appears in
double quotes; if the `<B>=</B>' is doubled, turn it off.
This forces parameter expansions to be split into
separate words before substitution, using <B>IFS</B> as a delimiter.
This is done by default in most other shells.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that splitting is applied to <I>word</I> in the assignment forms
of <I>spec</I> <I>before</I> the assignment to <I>name</I> is performed.
This affects the result of array assignments with the <B>A</B> flag.
</DL>

<DT><B>${~</B><I>spec</I><B>}</B><DD>
Turn on the <B>GLOB_SUBST</B> option for the evaluation of
<I>spec</I>; if the `<B>~</B>' is doubled, turn it off.  When this option is
set, the string resulting from the expansion will be interpreted as a
pattern anywhere that is possible, such as in filename expansion and
filename generation and pattern-matching contexts like the right
hand side of the `<B>=</B>' and `<B>!=</B>' operators in conditions.
</DL>
<P>

If a <B>${</B>...<B>}</B> type parameter expression or a
<B>$(</B>...<B>)</B> type command substitution is used in place of
<I>name</I> above, it is expanded first and the result is used as if
it were the value of <I>name</I>.  Thus it is
possible to perform nested operations:  <B>${${foo#head}%tail}</B>
substitutes the value of <B>$foo</B> with both `<B>head</B>' and `<B>tail</B>'
deleted.  The form with <B>$(</B>...<B>)</B> is often useful in
combination with the flags described next; see the examples below.
Each <I>name</I> or nested <B>${</B>...<B>}</B> in a parameter expansion may
also be followed by a subscript expression as described in
<I>Array Parameters</I> in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1).
<P>

Note that double quotes may appear around nested expressions, in which
case only the part inside is treated as quoted; for example,
<B>${(f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;}</B> quotes the result of <B>$(foo)</B>, but the flag `<B>(f)</B>'
(see below) is applied using the rules for unquoted expansions.  Note
further that quotes are themselves nested in this context; for example, in
<B>&quot;${(@f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;}&quot;</B>, there are two sets of quotes, one surrounding the
whole expression, the other (redundant) surrounding the <B>$(foo)</B> as
before.
<P>

<H3>Parameter Expansion Flags</H3>

If the opening brace is directly followed by an opening parenthesis,
the string up to the matching closing parenthesis will be taken as a
list of flags.  In cases where repeating a flag is meaningful, the
repetitions need not be consecutive; for example, `(<B>q%q%q</B>)'
means the same thing as the more readable `(<B>%%qqq</B>)'.  The
following flags are supported:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%</B>
Expand all <B>%</B> escapes in the resulting words in the same way as in in
prompts (see the section `Prompt Expansion'). If this flag is given twice,
full prompt expansion is done on the resulting words, depending on the
setting of the <B>PROMPT_PERCENT</B>, <B>PROMPT_SUBST</B> and <B>PROMPT_BANG</B>
options.
<DT><B>@</B><DD>
In double quotes, array elements are put into separate words.
E.g., `<B>&quot;${(@)foo}&quot;</B>' is equivalent to `<B>&quot;${foo[@]}&quot;</B>' and
`<B>&quot;${(@)foo[1,2]}&quot;</B>' is the same as `<B>&quot;$foo[1]&quot; &quot;$foo[2]&quot;</B>'.
This is distinct from <I>field splitting</I> by the the <B>f</B>, <B>s</B>
or <B>z</B> flags, which still applies within each array element.
<DT><B>A</B><DD>
Create an array parameter with `<B>${</B>...<B>=</B>...<B>}</B>',
`<B>${</B>...<B>:=</B>...<B>}</B>' or `<B>${</B>...<B>::=</B>...<B>}</B>'.
If this flag is repeated (as in `<B>AA</B>'), create an associative
array parameter.  Assignment is made before sorting or padding.
The <I>name</I> part may be a subscripted range for ordinary
arrays; the <I>word</I> part <I>must</I> be converted to an array, for
example by using `<B>${(AA)=</B><I>name</I><B>=</B>...<B>}</B>' to activate
field splitting, when creating an associative array.
<DT><B>a</B><DD>
With <B>o</B> or <B>O</B>, sort in array index order. Note that `<B>oa</B>' is
therefore equivalent to the default but `<B>Oa</B>' is useful for
obtaining an array's elements in reverse order.
<DT><B>c</B><DD>
With <B>${#</B><I>name</I><B>}</B>, count the total number of characters in an array,
as if the elements were concatenated with spaces between them.
<DT><B>C</B><DD>
Capitalize the resulting words.  `Words' in this case refers to sequences
of alphanumeric characters separated by non-alphanumerics, <I>not</I> to words
that result from field splitting.
<DT><B>e</B><DD>
Perform <I>parameter expansion</I>, <I>command substitution</I> and
<I>arithmetic expansion</I> on the result. Such expansions can be
nested but too deep recursion may have unpredictable effects.
<DT><B>f</B><DD>
Split the result of the expansion to lines. This is a shorthand
for `<B>ps:\n:</B>'.
<DT><B>F</B><DD>
Join the words of arrays together using newline as a separator.
This is a shorthand for `<B>pj:\n:</B>'.
<DT><B>i</B><DD>
With <B>o</B> or <B>O</B>, sort case-independently.
<DT><B>k</B><DD>
If <I>name</I> refers to an associative array, substitute the <I>keys</I>
(element names) rather than the values of the elements.  Used with
subscripts (including ordinary arrays), force indices or keys to be
substituted even if the subscript form refers to values.  However,
this flag may not be combined with subscript ranges.
<DT><B>L</B><DD>
Convert all letters in the result to lower case.
<DT><B>n</B><DD>
With <B>o</B> or <B>O</B>, sort numerically.
<DT><B>o</B><DD>
Sort the resulting words in ascending order.
<DT><B>O</B><DD>
Sort the resulting words in descending order.
<DT><B>P</B><DD>
This forces the value of the parameter <I>name</I> to be interpreted as a
further parameter name, whose value will be used where appropriate. If
used with a nested parameter or command substitution, the result of that
will be taken as a parameter name in the same way.  For example, if you
have `<B>foo=bar</B>' and `<B>bar=baz</B>', the strings <B>${(P)foo}</B>,
<B>${(P)${foo}}</B>, and <B>${(P)$(echo bar)}</B> will be expanded to `<B>baz</B>'.
<DT><B>q</B><DD>
Quote the resulting words with backslashes. If this flag is given
twice, the resulting words are quoted in single quotes and if it is
given three times, the words are quoted in double quotes. If it is
given four times, the words are quoted in single quotes preceded by a <B>$</B>.
<DT><B>Q</B><DD>
Remove one level of quotes from the resulting words.
<DT><B>t</B><DD>
Use a string describing the type of the parameter where the value
of the parameter would usually appear. This string consists of keywords
separated by hyphens (`<B>-</B>'). The first keyword in the string describes
the main type, it can be one of `<B>scalar</B>', `<B>array</B>', `<B>integer</B>',
`<B>float</B>' or `<B>association</B>'. The other keywords describe the type in
more detail:

Convert all letters in the result to upper case.
<DT><B>v</B><DD>
Used with <B>k</B>, substitute (as two consecutive words) both the key
and the value of each associative array element.  Used with subscripts,
force values to be substituted even if the subscript form refers to
indices or keys.
<DT><B>V</B><DD>
Make any special characters in the resulting words visible.
<DT><B>w</B><DD>
With <B>${#</B><I>name</I><B>}</B>, count words in arrays or strings; the <B>s</B>
flag may be used to set a word delimiter.
<DT><B>W</B><DD>
Similar to <B>w</B> with the difference that empty words between
repeated delimiters are also counted.
<DT><B>X</B><DD>
With this flag parsing errors occurring with the <B>Q</B> and <B>e</B> flags or the
pattern matching forms such as `<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>#</B><I>pattern</I><B>}</B>' 
are reported. Without the flag they are silently ignored.
<DT><B>z</B><DD>
Split the result of the expansion into words using shell parsing to
find the words, i.e. taking into account any quoting in the value.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that this is done very late, as for the `<B>(s)</B>' flag. So to
access single words in the result, one has to use nested expansions as 
in `<B>${${(z)foo}[2]}</B>'. Likewise, to remove the quotes in the
resulting words one would do: `<B>${(Q)${(z)foo}}</B>'.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

The following flags (except <B>p</B>) are followed by one or more arguments
as shown.  Any character, or the matching pairs `<B>(</B>...<B>)</B>',
`<B>{</B>...<B>}</B>', `<B>[</B>...<B>]</B>', or `<B>&lt;</B>...<B>&gt;</B>', may be used in place
of a colon as delimiters, but note that when a flag takes more than one
argument, a matched pair of delimiters must surround each argument.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>

<B>p</B>
Recognize the same escape sequences as the <B>print</B> builtin
in string arguments to any of the flags described below.
<DT><B>j:</B><I>string</I><B>:</B><DD>
Join the words of arrays together using <I>string</I> as a separator.
Note that this occurs before field splitting by the <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B>
option.
<DT><B>l:</B><I>expr</I><B>::</B><I>string1</I><B>::</B><I>string2</I><B>:</B><DD>
Pad the resulting words on the left.  Each word will be truncated if
required and placed in a field <I>expr</I> characters wide.  The space
to the left will be filled with <I>string1</I> (concatenated as often
as needed) or spaces if <I>string1</I> is not given.  If both
<I>string1</I> and <I>string2</I> are given, this string is inserted
once directly to the left of each word, before padding.
<DT><B>r:</B><I>expr</I><B>::</B><I>string1</I><B>::</B><I>string2</I><B>:</B><DD>
As <B>l</B>, but pad the words on the right and insert <I>string2</I>
on the right.
<DT><B>s:</B><I>string</I><B>:</B><DD>
Force field splitting (see the option <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B>) at the
separator <I>string</I>.  Note that a <I>string</I> of two or more
characters means all must all match in sequence; this differs from
the treatment of two or more characters in the <B>IFS</B> parameter.

The following flags are meaningful with the <B>${</B>...<B>#</B>...<B>}</B> or

<DT><B>I:</B><I>expr</I><B>:</B><DD>
Search the <I>expr</I>th match (where <I>expr</I> evaluates to a number).
This only applies when searching for substrings, either with the <B>S</B>

The <I>expr</I>th match is counted such that there is either one or zero

<H3>Rules</H3>

<P>

Here is a summary of the rules for substitution; this assumes that braces
are present around the substitution, i.e. <B>${...}</B>.  Some particular
examples are given below.  Note that the Zsh Development Group accepts
<I>no responsibility</I> for any brain damage which may occur during the
reading of the following rules.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>1.</B> <I>Nested Substitution</I>
If multiple nested <B>${...}</B> forms are present, substitution is
performed from the inside outwards.  At each level, the substitution takes
account of whether the current value is a scalar or an array, whether the
whole substitution is in double quotes, and what flags are supplied to the
current level of substitution, just as if the nested substitution were the
outermost.  The flags are not propagated up to enclosing
substitutions; the nested substitution will return either a scalar or an
array as determined by the flags, possibly adjusted for quoting.  All the
following steps take place where applicable at all levels of substitution.
Note that, unless the `<B>(P)</B>' flag is present, the flags and any subscripts
apply directly to the value of the nested substitution; for example, the
expansion <B>${${foo}}</B> behaves exactly the same as <B>${foo}</B>.
<DT><B>2.</B> <I>Parameter Subscripting</I><DD>
If the value is a raw parameter reference with a subscript, such as
<B>${</B><I>var</I><B>[3]}</B>, the effect of subscripting is applied directly to
the parameter.  Subscripts are evaluated left to right; subsequent
subscripts apply to the scalar or array value yielded by the previous
subscript.  Thus if <B>var</B> is an array, <B>${var[1][2]}</B> is the second
character of the first word, but <B>${var[2,4][2]}</B> is the entire third
word (the second word of the range of words two through four of the
original array).  Any number of subscripts may appear.
<DT><B>3.</B> <I>Parameter Name Replacement</I><DD>
The effect of any <B>(P)</B> flag, which treats the value so far as a
parameter name and replaces it with the corresponding value, is applied.
<DT><B>4.</B> <I>Double-Quoted Joining</I><DD>
If the value after this process is an array, and the substitution
appears in double quotes, and no <B>(@)</B> flag is present at the current
level, the words of the value are joined with the first character of the
parameter <B>$IFS</B>, by default a space, between each word (single word
arrays are not modified).  If the <B>(j)</B> flag is present, that is used for
joining instead of <B>$IFS</B>.
<DT><B>5.</B> <I>Nested Subscripting</I><DD>
Any remaining subscripts (i.e. of a nested substitution) are evaluated at
this point, based on whether the value is an array or a scalar.  As with
<B>2.</B>, multiple subscripts can appear.  Note that <B>${foo[2,4][2]}</B> is
thus equivalent to <B>${${foo[2,4]}[2]}</B> and also to
<B>&quot;${${(@)foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot;</B> (the nested substitution returns an array in
both cases), but not to <B>&quot;${${foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot;</B> (the nested substitution
returns a scalar because of the quotes).
<DT><B>6.</B> <I>Modifiers</I><DD>
Any modifiers, as specified by a trailing `<B>#</B>', `<B>%</B>', `<B>/</B>'
(possibly doubled) or by a set of modifiers of the form <B>:...</B> (see
the section `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion'), are applied to the words
of the value at this level.
<DT><B>7.</B> <I>Forced Joining</I><DD>
If the `<B>(j)</B>' flag is present, or no `<B>(j)</B>' flag is present but
the string is to be split as given by rules <B>8.</B> or <B>9.</B>, and joining
did not take place at step <B>4.</B>, any words in the value are joined
together using the given string or the first character of <B>$IFS</B> if none.
Note that the `<B>(F)</B>' flag implicitly supplies a string for joining in this
manner.
<DT><B>8.</B> <I>Forced Splitting</I><DD>
If one of the `<B>(s)</B>', `<B>(f)</B>' or `<B>(z)</B>' flags are present, or the `<B>=</B>'
specifier was present (e.g. <B>${=</B><I>var</I><B>}</B>), the word is split on
occurrences of the specified string, or (for <B>=</B> with neither of the two
flags present) any of the characters in <B>$IFS</B>.
<DT><B>9.</B> <I>Shell Word Splitting</I><DD>
If no `<B>(s)</B>', `<B>(f)</B>' or `<B>=</B>' was given, but the word is not
quoted and the option <B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> is set, the word is split on
occurrences of any of the characters in <B>$IFS</B>.  Note this step, too,
takes place at all levels of a nested substitution.
<DT><B>10.</B> <I>Re-Evaluation</I><DD>
Any `<B>(e)</B>' flag is applied to the value, forcing it to be re-examined
for new parameter substitutions, but also for command and arithmetic
substitutions.
<DT><B>11.</B> <I>Padding</I><DD>
Any padding of the value by the `<B>(l.</B><I>fill</I><B>.)</B>' or
`<B>(r.</B><I>fill</I><B>.)</B>' flags is applied.
<DT><B>12.</B> <I>Semantic Joining</I><DD>
In contexts where expansion semantics requires a single word to
result, all words are rejoined with the first character of <B>IFS</B>
between.  So in `<B>${(P</B><B>)${(f</B><B>)lines}}</B>'
the value of <B>${lines}</B> is split at newlines, but then must be
joined again before the <B>P</B> flag can be applied.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If a single word is not required, this rule is skipped.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbCB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Examples</H3>

The flag <B>f</B> is useful to split a double-quoted substitution line by
line.  For example, <B>${(f)&quot;$(&lt;</B><I>file</I><B>)&quot;}</B>
substitutes the contents of <I>file</I> divided so that each line is
an element of the resulting array.  Compare this with the effect of
<B>$</B><B>(&lt;</B><I>file</I><B>)</B> alone, which divides the file
up by words, or the same inside double quotes, which makes the entire
content of the file a single string.
<P>

The following illustrates the rules for nested parameter expansions.
Suppose that <B>$foo</B> contains the array <B>(bar baz</B><B>)</B>:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>&quot;${(@)${foo}[1]}&quot;</B>
This produces the result <B>b</B>.  First, the inner substitution
<B>&quot;${foo}&quot;</B>, which has no array (<B>@</B>) flag, produces a single word
result <B>&quot;bar baz&quot;</B>.  The outer substitution <B>&quot;${(@)...[1]}&quot;</B> detects
that this is a scalar, so that (despite the `<B>(@)</B>' flag) the subscript
picks the first character. 
<DT><B>&quot;${${(@)foo}[1]}&quot;</B><DD>
This produces the result `<B>bar</B>'.  In this case, the inner substitution
<B>&quot;${(@)foo}&quot;</B> produces the array `<B>(bar baz</B><B>)</B>'.  The outer
substitution <B>&quot;${...[1]}&quot;</B> detects that this is an array and picks the
first word.  This is similar to the simple case <B>&quot;${foo[1]}&quot;</B>.
</DL>
<P>

As an example of the rules for word splitting and joining, suppose <B>$foo</B>
contains the array `<B>(ax1 bx1</B><B>)</B>'.  Then
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>${(s/x/)foo}</B>
produces the words `<B>a</B>', `<B>1 b</B>' and `<B>1</B>'.
<DT><B>${(j/x/s/x/)foo}</B><DD>
produces `<B>a</B>', `<B>1</B>', `<B>b</B>' and `<B>1</B>'.
<DT><B>${(s/x/)foo%%1*}</B><DD>
produces `<B>a</B>' and `<B> b</B>' (note the extra space).  As substitution
occurs before either joining or splitting, the operation  first generates
the modified array <B>(ax bx</B><B>)</B>, which is joined to give
<B>&quot;ax bx&quot;</B>, and then split to give `<B>a</B>', `<B> b</B>' and `'.  The final
empty string will then be elided, as it is not in double quotes.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbCC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND SUBSTITUTION</H2>

A command enclosed in parentheses preceded by a dollar sign, like
`<B>$(</B>...<B>)</B>', or quoted with grave 
accents, like `<B>`</B>...<B>`</B>', is replaced with its standard output, with
any trailing newlines deleted.
If the substitution is not enclosed in double quotes, the
output is broken into words using the <B>IFS</B> parameter.
The substitution `<B>$(cat</B> <I>foo</I><B>)</B>' may be replaced
by the equivalent but faster `<B>$(&lt;</B><I>foo</I><B>)</B>'.
In either case, if the option <B>GLOB_SUBST</B> is set,
the output is eligible for filename generation.
<A NAME="lbCD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ARITHMETIC EXPANSION</H2>

A string of the form `<B>$[</B><I>exp</I><B>]</B>' or
`<B>$((</B><I>exp</I><B>))</B>' is substituted
with the value of the arithmetic expression <I>exp</I>.  <I>exp</I> is
subjected to <I>parameter expansion</I>, <I>command substitution</I>
and <I>arithmetic expansion</I> before it is evaluated.
See the section `Arithmetic Evaluation'.
<A NAME="lbCE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BRACE EXPANSION</H2>

A string of the form
`<I>foo</I><B>{</B><I>xx</I><B>,</B><I>yy</I><B>,</B><I>zz</I><B>}</B><I>bar</I>'
is expanded to the individual words
`<I>fooxxbar</I>', `<I>fooyybar</I>' and `<I>foozzbar</I>'.
Left-to-right order is preserved.  This construct
may be nested.  Commas may be quoted in order to
include them literally in a word.
<P>

An expression of the form `<B>{</B><I>n1</I><B>..</B><I>n2</I><B>}</B>',
where <I>n1</I> and <I>n2</I> are integers,
is expanded to every number between
<I>n1</I> and <I>n2</I> inclusive.  If either number begins with a
zero, all the resulting numbers will be padded with leading zeroes to
that minimum width.  If the numbers are in decreasing order the
resulting sequence will also be in decreasing order.
<P>

If a brace expression matches none of the above forms, it is left
unchanged, unless the <B>BRACE_CCL</B> option is set.
In that case, it is expanded to a sorted list of the individual
characters between the braces, in the manner of a search set.
`<B>-</B>' is treated specially as in a search set, but `<B>^</B>' or `<B>!</B>' as
the first character is treated normally.
<P>

Note that brace expansion is not part of filename generation (globbing); an
expression such as <B>*/{foo,bar}</B> is split into two separate words
<B>*/foo</B> and <B>*/bar</B> before filename generation takes place.  In
particular, note that this is liable to produce a `no match' error if
<I>either</I> of the two expressions does not match; this is to be contrasted
with <B>*/(foo|bar)</B>, which is treated as a single pattern but otherwise
has similar effects.
<A NAME="lbCF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILENAME EXPANSION</H2>

Each word is checked to see if it begins with an unquoted `<B>~</B>'.
If it does, then the word up to a `<B>/</B>',
or the end of the word if there is no `<B>/</B>',
is checked to see if it can be substituted in one of the ways
described here.  If so, then the `<B>~</B>' and the checked portion are
replaced with the appropriate substitute value.
<P>

A `<B>~</B>' by itself is replaced by the value of <B>$HOME</B>.
A `<B>~</B>' followed by a `<B>+</B>' or a `<B>-</B>' is replaced by the value of
<B>$PWD</B> or <B>$OLDPWD</B>, respectively.
<P>

A `<B>~</B>' followed by a number is replaced by the directory at that
position in the directory stack.
`<B>~0</B>' is equivalent to `<B>~+</B>',
and `<B>~1</B>' is the top of the stack.
`<B>~+</B>' followed by a number is replaced by the directory at that
position in the directory stack.
`<B>~+0</B>' is equivalent to `<B>~+</B>',
and `<B>~+1</B>' is the top of the stack.
`<B>~-</B>' followed by a number is replaced by the directory that
many positions from the bottom of the stack.
`<B>~-0</B>' is the bottom of the stack.
The <B>PUSHD_MINUS</B>
option exchanges the effects of `<B>~+</B>' and `<B>~-</B>' where they are
followed by a number.
<P>

A `<B>~</B>' followed by anything not already covered is looked up as a
named directory, and replaced by the value of that named directory if found.
Named directories are typically home directories for users on the system.
They may also be defined if the text after the `<B>~</B>' is the name
of a string shell parameter whose value begins with a `<B>/</B>'.
It is also possible to define directory names using the <B>-d</B> option to the
<B>hash</B> builtin.
<P>

In certain circumstances (in prompts, for instance), when the shell
prints a path, the path is checked to see if it has a named
directory as its prefix.  If so, then the prefix portion
is replaced with a `<B>~</B>' followed by the name of the directory.
The shortest way of referring to the directory is used,
with ties broken in favour of using a named directory,
except when the directory is <B>/</B> itself.  The parameters <B>$PWD</B> and
<B>$OLDPWD</B> are never abbreviated in this fashion.
<P>

If a word begins with an unquoted `<B>=</B>'
and the <B>EQUALS</B> option is set,
the remainder of the word is taken as the
name of a command.  If a command
exists by that name, the word is replaced
by the full pathname of the command.
<P>

Filename expansion is performed on the right hand side of a parameter
assignment, including those appearing after commands of the
<B>typeset</B> family.  In this case, the right hand side will be treated
as a colon-separated list in the manner of the <B>PATH</B> parameter,
so that a `<B>~</B>' or an `<B>=</B>' following a `<B>:</B>' is eligible for expansion.
All such behaviour can be
disabled by quoting the `<B>~</B>', the `<B>=</B>', or the whole expression (but not
simply the colon); the <B>EQUALS</B> option is also respected.
<P>

If the option <B>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST</B> is set, any unquoted shell
argument in the form `<I>identifier</I><B>=</B><I>expression</I>' becomes eligible
for file expansion as described in the previous paragraph.  Quoting the
first `<B>=</B>' also inhibits this.
<A NAME="lbCG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILENAME GENERATION</H2>

If a word contains an unquoted instance of one of the characters
`<B>*</B>', `<B>(</B>', `<B>|</B>', `<B>&lt;</B>', `<B>[</B>', or `<B>?</B>', it is regarded
as a pattern for filename generation, unless the <B>GLOB</B> option is unset.
If the <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> option is set,
the `<B>^</B>' and `<B>#</B>' characters also denote a pattern; otherwise
they are not treated specially by the shell.
<P>

The word is replaced with a list of sorted filenames that match
the pattern.  If no matching pattern is found, the shell gives
an error message, unless the <B>NULL_GLOB</B> option is set,
in which case the word is deleted; or unless the <B>NOMATCH</B>
option is unset, in which case the word is left unchanged.
<P>

In filename generation,
the character `<B>/</B>' must be matched explicitly;
also, a `<B>.</B>' must be matched
explicitly at the beginning of a pattern or after a `<B>/</B>', unless the
<B>GLOB_DOTS</B> option is set.
No filename generation pattern
matches the files `<B>.</B>' or `<B>..</B>'.  In other instances of pattern
matching, the `<B>/</B>' and `<B>.</B>' are not treated specially.
<A NAME="lbCH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Glob Operators</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>*</B>
Matches any string, including the null string.
<DT><B>?</B><DD>
Matches any character.
<DT><B>[</B>...<B>]</B><DD>
Matches any of the enclosed characters.  Ranges of characters
can be specified by separating two characters by a `<B>-</B>'.
A `<B>-</B>' or `<B>]</B>' may be matched by including it as the
first character in the list.
There are also several named classes of characters, in the form
`<B>[:</B><I>name</I><B>:]</B>' with the following meanings:  `<B>[:alnum:]</B>'
alphanumeric, `<B>[:alpha:]</B>' alphabetic,
`<B>[:ascii:]</B>' 7-bit,
`<B>[:blank:]</B>' space or tab,
`<B>[:cntrl:]</B>' control character, `<B>[:digit:]</B>' decimal
digit, `<B>[:graph:]</B>' printable character except whitespace,
`<B>[:lower:]</B>' lowercase letter, `<B>[:print:]</B>' printable character,
`<B>[:punct:]</B>' printable character neither alphanumeric nor whitespace,
`<B>[:space:]</B>' whitespace character, `<B>[:upper:]</B>' uppercase letter, 
`<B>[:xdigit:]</B>' hexadecimal digit.  These use the macros provided by
the operating system to test for the given character combinations,
including any modifications due to local language settings:  see
<I><A HREF="../man3/ctype.3.php">ctype</A></I>(3).  Note that the square brackets are additional
to those enclosing the whole set of characters, so to test for a
single alphanumeric character you need `<B>[[:alnum:]]</B>'.  Named
character sets can be used alongside other types,
e.g. `<B>[[:alpha:]0-9]</B>'.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>[^</B>...<B>]</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>[!</B>...<B>]</B>
Like <B>[</B>...<B>]</B>, except that it matches any character which is
not in the given set.
<DT><B>&lt;</B>[<I>x</I>]<B>-</B>[<I>y</I>]<B>&gt;</B><DD>
Matches any number in the range <I>x</I> to <I>y</I>, inclusive.
Either of the numbers may be omitted to make the range open-ended;
hence `<B>&lt;-&gt;</B>' matches any number.  To match individual digits, the
<B>[</B>...<B>]</B> form is more efficient.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Be careful when using other wildcards adjacent to patterns of this form;
for example, <B>&lt;0-9&gt;*</B> will actually match any number whatsoever at the
start of the string, since the `<B>&lt;0-9&gt;</B>' will match the first digit, and
the `<B>*</B>' will match any others.  This is a trap for the unwary, but is
in fact an inevitable consequence of the rule that the longest possible
match always succeeds.  Expressions such as `<B>&lt;0-9&gt;[^[:digit:]]*</B>' can be
used instead.
</DL>

<DT><B>(</B>...<B>)</B><DD>
Matches the enclosed pattern.  This is used for grouping.
If the <B>KSH_GLOB</B> option is set, then a
`<B>@</B>', `<B>*</B>', `<B>+</B>', `<B>?</B>' or `<B>!</B>' immediately preceding
the `<B>(</B>' is treated specially, as detailed below. The option
<B>SH_GLOB</B> prevents bare parentheses from being used in this way, though
the <B>KSH_GLOB</B> option is still available.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that grouping cannot extend over multiple directories: it is an error
to have a `<B>/</B>' within a group (this only applies for patterns used in
filename generation).  There is one exception:  a group of the form
<B>(</B><I>pat</I><B>/)#</B> appearing as a complete path segment can
match a sequence of directories.  For example, <B>foo/(a*/)#bar</B> matches
<B>foo/bar</B>, <B>foo/any/bar</B>, <B>foo/any/anyother/bar</B>, and so on.
</DL>

<DT><I>x</I><B>|</B><I>y</I><DD>
Matches either <I>x</I> or <I>y</I>.
This operator has lower precedence than any other.
The `<B>|</B>' character
must be within parentheses, to avoid interpretation as a pipeline.
<DT><B>^</B><I>x</I><DD>
(Requires <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> to be set.)
Matches anything except the pattern <I>x</I>.
This has a higher precedence than `<B>/</B>', so `<B>^foo/bar</B>'
will search directories in `<B>.</B>' except `<B>./foo</B>'
for a file named `<B>bar</B>'.
<DT><I>x</I><B>~</B><I>y</I><DD>
(Requires <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> to be set.)
Match anything that matches the pattern <I>x</I> but does not match <I>y</I>.
This has lower precedence than any operator except `<B>|</B>', so
`<B>*/*~foo/bar</B>' will search for all files in all directories in `<B>.</B>'
and then exclude `<B>foo/bar</B>' if there was such a match.
Multiple patterns can be excluded by
`<I>foo</I><B>~</B><I>bar</I><B>~</B><I>baz</I>'.
In the exclusion pattern (<I>y</I>), `<B>/</B>' and `<B>.</B>' are not treated
specially the way they usually are in globbing.
<DT><I>x</I><B>#</B><DD>
(Requires <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> to be set.)
Matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern <I>x</I>.
This operator has high precedence; `<B>12#</B>' is equivalent to `<B>1(2#)</B>',
rather than `<B>(12)#</B>'.  It is an error for an unquoted `<B>#</B>' to follow
something which cannot be repeated; this includes an empty string, a
pattern already followed by `<B>##</B>', or parentheses when part of a
<B>KSH_GLOB</B> pattern (for example, `<B>!(</B><I>foo</I><B>)#</B>' is
invalid and must be replaced by
`<B>*(!(</B><I>foo</I><B>))</B>').
<DT><I>x</I><B>##</B><DD>
(Requires <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> to be set.)
Matches one or more occurrences of the pattern <I>x</I>.
This operator has high precedence; `<B>12##</B>' is equivalent to `<B>1(2##)</B>',
rather than `<B>(12)##</B>'.  No more than two active `<B>#</B>' characters may
appear together.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbCI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>ksh-like Glob Operators</H3>

If the <B>KSH_GLOB</B> option is set, the effects of parentheses can be
modified by a preceding `<B>@</B>', `<B>*</B>', `<B>+</B>', `<B>?</B>' or `<B>!</B>'.
This character need not be unquoted to have special effects,
but the `<B>(</B>' must be.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>@(</B>...<B>)</B>
Match the pattern in the parentheses.  (Like `<B>(</B>...<B>)</B>'.)
<DT><B>*(</B>...<B>)</B><DD>
Match any number of occurrences.  (Like `<B>(</B>...<B>)#</B>'.)
<DT><B>+(</B>...<B>)</B><DD>
Match at least one occurrence.  (Like `<B>(</B>...<B>)##</B>'.)
<DT><B>?(</B>...<B>)</B><DD>
Match zero or one occurrence.  (Like `<B>(|</B>...<B>)</B>'.)
<DT><B>!(</B>...<B>)</B><DD>
Match anything but the expression in parentheses.
(Like `<B>(^(</B>...<B>))</B>'.)
</DL>
<A NAME="lbCJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Precedence</H3>

The precedence of the operators given above is (highest) `<B>^</B>', `<B>/</B>',
`<B>~</B>', `<B>|</B>' (lowest); the
remaining operators are simply treated from left to right as part of a
string, with `<B>#</B>' and `<B>##</B>' applying to the shortest possible
preceding unit (i.e. a character, `<B>?</B>', `<B>[</B>...<B>]</B>',
`<B>&lt;</B>...<B>&gt;</B>', or a parenthesised expression).  As mentioned
above, a `<B>/</B>' used as a directory separator may not appear inside
parentheses, while a `<B>|</B>' must do so; in patterns used in other contexts
than filename generation (for example, in <B>case</B> statements and tests
within `<B>[[</B>...<B>]]</B>'), a `<B>/</B>' is not special; and `<B>/</B>' is also
not special after a `<B>~</B>' appearing outside parentheses in a filename
pattern.
<A NAME="lbCK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Globbing Flags</H3>

There are various flags which affect any text to their right up to the
end of the enclosing group or to the end of the pattern; they require
the <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> option. All take the form
<B>(#</B><I>X</I><B>)</B> where <I>X</I> may have one of the following
forms:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
i
Case insensitive:  upper or lower case characters in the pattern match
upper or lower case characters.
<DT>l<DD>
Lower case characters in the pattern match upper or lower case
characters; upper case characters in the pattern still only match
upper case characters.
<DT>I<DD>
Case sensitive:  locally negates the effect of <B>i</B> or <B>l</B> from
that point on.
<DT>b<DD>
Activate backreferences for parenthesised groups in the pattern;
this does not work in filename generation.  When a pattern with a set of
active parentheses is matched, the strings matched by the groups are
stored in the array <B>$match</B>, the indices of the beginning of the matched
parentheses in the array <B>$mbegin</B>, and the indices of the end in the array
<B>$mend</B>, with the first element of each array corresponding to the first
parenthesised group, and so on.  These arrays are not otherwise special to
the shell.  The indices use the same convention as does parameter
substitution, so that elements of <B>$mend</B> and <B>$mbegin</B> may be used in
subscripts; the <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B> option is respected.  Sets of globbing flags
are not considered parenthesised groups; only the first nine active
parentheses can be referenced.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>foo=&quot;a string with a message&quot;
if [[ $foo = (a|an)' '(#b)(*)' '* ]]; then
  print ${foo[$mbegin[1],$mend[1]]}
fi</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

prints `<B>string with a</B>'.  Note that the first parenthesis is before the
<B>(#b)</B> and does not create a backreference.
<P>

Backreferences work with all forms of pattern matching other than filename
generation, but note that when performing matches on an entire array, such
as <B>${</B><I>array</I><B>#</B><I>pattern</I><B>}</B>, or a global substitution, such
as <B>${</B><I>param</I><B>//</B><I>pat</I><B>/</B><I>repl</I><B>}</B>, only the data for the
last match remains available.  In the case of global replacements this may
still be useful.  See the example for the <B>m</B> flag below.
<P>

The numbering of backreferences strictly follows the order of the opening
parentheses from left to right in the pattern string, although sets of
parentheses may be nested.  There are special rules for parentheses followed
by `<B>#</B>' or `<B>##</B>'.  Only the last match of the parenthesis is
remembered: for example, in `<B>[[ abab = (#b)([ab])# ]]</B>', only the final
`<B>b</B>' is stored in <B>match[1]</B>.  Thus extra parentheses may be necessary
to match the complete segment: for example, use `<B>X((ab|cd)#)Y</B>' to match
a whole string of either `<B>ab</B>' or `<B>cd</B>' between `<B>X</B>' and `<B>Y</B>',
using the value of <B>$match[1]</B> rather than <B>$match[2]</B>.
<P>

If the match fails none of the parameters is altered, so in some cases it
may be necessary to initialise them beforehand.  If some of the
backreferences fail to match --- which happens if they are in an alternate
branch which fails to match, or if they are followed by <B>#</B> and matched
zero times --- then the matched string is set to the empty string, and the
start and end indices are set to -1.
<P>

Pattern matching with backreferences is slightly slower than without.
</DL>

<DT>B<DD>
Deactivate backreferences, negating the effect of the <B>b</B> flag from that
point on.
<DT>m<DD>
Set references to the match data for the entire string matched; this is
similar to backreferencing and does not work in filename generation.  The
flag must be in effect at the end of the pattern, i.e. not local to a
group. The parameters <B>$MATCH</B>,  <B>$MBEGIN</B> and <B>$MEND</B> will be set to
the string matched and to the indices of the beginning and end of the
string, respectively.  This is most useful in parameter substitutions, as
otherwise the string matched is obvious.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>arr=(veldt jynx grimps waqf zho buck)
print ${arr//(#m)[aeiou]/${(U)MATCH}}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

forces all the matches (i.e. all vowels) into uppercase, printing
`<B>vEldt jynx grImps wAqf zhO bUck</B>'.
<P>

Unlike backreferences, there is no speed penalty for using match
references, other than the extra substitutions required for the
replacement strings in cases such as the example shown.
</DL>

<DT>M<DD>
Deactivate the <B>m</B> flag, hence no references to match data will be
created.
<DT><B>a</B><I>num</I><DD>
Approximate matching: <I>num</I> errors are allowed in the string matched by
the pattern.  The rules for this are described in the next subsection.
<DT><B>s</B>, <B>e</B><DD>
Unlike the other flags, these have only a local effect, and each must
appear on its own:  `<B>(#s)</B>' and `<B>(#e)</B>' are the only valid forms.
The `<B>(#s)</B>' flag succeeds only at the start of the test string, and the
`<B>(#e)</B>' flag succeeds only at the end of the test string; they
correspond to `<B>^</B>' and `<B>$</B>' in standard regular expressions.  They
are useful for matching path segments in patterns other than those in
filename generation (where path segments are in any case treated
separately).  For example, `<B>*((#s)|/)test((#e)|/)*</B>' matches a path
segment `<B>test</B>' in any of the following strings: <B>test</B>,
<B>test/at/start</B>, <B>at/end/test</B>, <B>in/test/middle</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Another use is in parameter substitution; for example
`<B>${array/(#s)A*Z(#e)}</B>' will remove only elements of an array which
match the complete pattern `<B>A*Z</B>'.  There are other ways of performing
many operations of this type, however the combination of the substitution
operations `<B>/</B>' and `<B>//</B>' with the `<B>(#s)</B>' and `<B>(#e)</B>' flags
provides a single simple and memorable method.
<P>

Note that assertions of the form `<B>(^(#s))</B>' also work, i.e. match
anywhere except at the start of the string, although this actually means
`anything except a zero-length portion at the start of the string'; you
need to use `<B>(&quot;&quot;~(#s))</B>' to match a zero-length portion of the string
not at the start.
</DL>

<DT><B>q</B><DD>
A `<B>q</B>' and everything up to the closing parenthesis of the globbing
flags are ignored by the pattern matching code.  This is intended to
support the use of glob qualifiers, see below.  The result is that
the pattern `<B>(#b)(*).c(#q.)</B>' can be used both for globbing and for
matching against a string.  In the former case, the `<B>(#q.)</B>' will be
treated as a glob qualifier and the `<B>(#b)</B>' will not be useful, while in
the latter case the `<B>(#b)</B>' is useful for backreferences and the
`<B>(#q.)</B>' will be ignored.  Note that colon modifiers in the glob
qualifiers are also not applied in ordinary pattern matching.
</DL>
<P>

For example, the test string <B>fooxx</B> can be matched by the pattern
<B>(#i</B><B>)FOOXX</B>, but not by <B>(#l</B><B>)FOOXX</B>,
<B>(#i</B><B>)FOO</B><B>(#I</B><B>)XX</B> or
<B>((#i</B><B>)FOOX</B><B>)X</B>.  The string
<B>(#ia2</B><B>)readme</B> specifies case-insensitive matching of
<B>readme</B> with up to two errors.
<P>

When using the ksh syntax for grouping both <B>KSH_GLOB</B> and
<B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> must be set and the left parenthesis should be
preceded by <B>@</B>.  Note also that the flags do not affect letters
inside <B>[...]</B> groups, in other words <B>(#i</B><B>)[a-z]</B>
still matches only lowercase letters.  Finally, note that when
examining whole paths case-insensitively every directory must be
searched for all files which match, so that a pattern of the form
<B>(#i</B><B>)/foo/bar/...</B> is potentially slow.
<P>

<A NAME="lbCL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Approximate Matching</H3>

When matching approximately, the shell keeps a count of the errors found,
which cannot exceed the number specified in the
<B>(#a</B><I>num</I><B>)</B> flags.  Four types of error are recognised:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
1.
Different characters, as in <B>fooxbar</B> and <B>fooybar</B>.
<DT>2.<DD>
Transposition of characters, as in <B>banana</B> and <B>abnana</B>.
<DT>3.<DD>
A character missing in the target string, as with the pattern <B>road</B> and
target string <B>rod</B>.
<DT>4.<DD>
An extra character appearing in the target string, as with <B>stove</B>
and <B>strove</B>.
</DL>
<P>

Thus, the pattern <B>(#a3</B><B>)abcd</B> matches <B>dcba</B>, with the
errors occurring by using the first rule twice and the second once,
grouping the string as <B>[d][cb][a]</B> and <B>[a][bc][d]</B>.
<P>

Non-literal parts of the pattern must match exactly, including characters
in character ranges: hence <B>(#a1</B><B>)???</B>  matches strings of
length four, by applying rule 4 to an empty part of the pattern, but not
strings of length two, since all the <B>?</B> must match.  Other characters
which must match exactly are initial dots in filenames (unless the
<B>GLOB_DOTS</B> option is set), and all slashes in filenames, so that
<B>a/bc</B> is two errors from <B>ab/c</B> (the slash cannot be transposed with
another character).  Similarly, errors are counted separately for
non-contiguous strings in the pattern, so that <B>(ab|cd</B><B>)ef</B>
is two errors from <B>aebf</B>.
<P>

When using exclusion via the <B>~</B> operator, approximate matching is
treated entirely separately for the excluded part and must be activated
separately.  Thus, <B>(#a1</B><B>)README~READ_ME</B> matches
<B>READ.ME</B> but not <B>READ_ME</B>, as the trailing <B>READ_ME</B> is matched
without approximation.  However,
<B>(#a1</B><B>)README~(#a1</B><B>)READ_ME</B>
does not match any pattern of the form <B>READ</B><I>?</I><B>ME</B> as all
such forms are now excluded.
<P>

Apart from exclusions, there is only one overall error count; however, the
maximum errors allowed may be altered locally, and this can be delimited by
grouping.  For example,
<B>(#a1</B><B>)cat</B><B>((#a0</B><B>)dog</B><B>)fox</B>
allows one error in total, which may not occur in the <B>dog</B> section, and
the pattern
<B>(#a1</B><B>)cat</B><B>(#a0</B><B>)dog</B><B>(#a1</B><B>)fox</B>
is equivalent.  Note that the point at which an error is first found is the
crucial one for establishing whether to use approximation; for example,
<B>(#a1)abc(#a0)xyz</B> will not match <B>abcdxyz</B>, because the error occurs
at the `<B>x</B>', where approximation is turned off.
<P>

Entire path segments may be matched approximately, so that
`<B>(#a1)/foo/d/is/available/at/the/bar</B>' allows one error in any path
segment.  This is much less efficient than without the <B>(#a1)</B>, however,
since every directory in the path must be scanned for a possible
approximate match.  It is best to place the <B>(#a1)</B> after any path
segments which are known to be correct.

<H3>Recursive Globbing</H3>

A pathname component of the form `<B>(</B><I>foo</I><B>/)#</B>'
matches a path consisting of zero or more directories
matching the pattern <I>foo</I>.
<P>

As a shorthand, `<B>**/</B>' is equivalent to `<B>(*/)#</B>'; note that this
therefore matches files in the current directory as well as
subdirectories.
Thus:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>ls (*/)#bar</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

or
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>ls **/bar</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

does a recursive directory search for files named `<B>bar</B>' (potentially
including the file `<B>bar</B>' in the current directory).  This form does not
follow symbolic links; the alternative form `<B>***/</B>' does, but is
otherwise identical.  Neither of these can be combined with other forms of
globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the `<B>*</B>'
operators revert to their usual effect.
<A NAME="lbCN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Glob Qualifiers</H3>

Patterns used for filename generation may end in a
list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses.
The qualifiers specify which filenames that otherwise match the given pattern
will be inserted in the argument list.
<P>

If the option <B>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</B> is set, then a trailing set of parentheses
containing no `<B>|</B>' or `<B>(</B>' characters (or `<B>~</B>' if it is special)
is taken as a set of
glob qualifiers.  A glob subexpression that would normally be taken as glob
qualifiers, for example `<B>(^x)</B>', can be forced to be treated as part of
the glob pattern by doubling the parentheses, in this case producing
`<B>((^x))</B>'.
<P>

If the option <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> is set, a different syntax for glob
qualifiers is available, namely `<B>(#qx)</B>' where <B>x</B> is any of the same
glob qualifiers used in the other format.  The qualifiers must still appear
at the end of the pattern.  However, with this syntax multiple glob
qualifiers may be chained together.  They are treated as a logical AND of
the individual sets of flags.  Also, as the syntax is unambiguous, the
expression will be treated as glob qualifiers just as long any parentheses
contained within it are balanced; appearance of `<B>|</B>', `<B>(</B>' or
`<B>~</B>' does not negate the effect.  Note that qualifiers will be
recognised in this form even if a bare glob qualifier exists at the end of
the pattern, for example `<B>*(#q*)(.)</B>' will recognise executable regular
files if both options are set; however, mixed syntax should probably be
avoided for the sake of clarity.
<P>

A qualifier may be any one of the following:

<DT><B>f</B><I>spec</I><DD>
files with access rights matching <I>spec</I>. This <I>spec</I> may be a
octal number optionally preceded by a `<B>=</B>', a `<B>+</B>', or a
`<B>-</B>'. If none of these characters is given, the behavior is the
same as for `<B>=</B>'. The octal number describes the mode bits to be
expected, if combined with a `<B>=</B>', the value given must match the
file-modes exactly, with a `<B>+</B>', at least the bits in the
given number must be set in the file-modes, and with a `<B>-</B>', the
bits in the number must not be set. Giving a `<B>?</B>' instead of a
octal digit anywhere in the number ensures that the corresponding bits 
in the file-modes are not checked, this is only useful in combination
with `<B>=</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the qualifier `<B>f</B>' is followed by any other character anything
up to the next matching character (`<B>[</B>', `<B>{</B>', and `<B>&lt;</B>' match 
`<B>]</B>', `<B>}</B>', and `<B>&gt;</B>' respectively, any other character
matches itself) is taken as a list of comma-separated
<I>sub-spec</I>s. Each <I>sub-spec</I> may be either an octal number as
described above or a list of any of the characters `<B>u</B>', `<B>g</B>',
`<B>o</B>', and `<B>a</B>', followed by a `<B>=</B>', a `<B>+</B>', or a
`<B>-</B>', followed by a list of any of the characters `<B>r</B>', `<B>w</B>', 
`<B>x</B>', `<B>s</B>', and `<B>t</B>', or an octal digit. The first list of
characters specify which access rights are to be checked. If a `<B>u</B>'
is given, those for the owner of the file are used, if a `<B>g</B>' is
given, those of the group are checked, a `<B>o</B>' means to test those
of other users, and the `<B>a</B>' says to test all three groups. The
`<B>=</B>', `<B>+</B>', and `<B>-</B>' again says how the modes are to be
checked and have the same meaning as described for the first form
above. The second list of characters finally says which access rights
are to be expected: `<B>r</B>' for read access, `<B>w</B>' for write access, 
`<B>x</B>' for the right to execute the file (or to search a directory),
`<B>s</B>' for the setuid and setgid bits, and `<B>t</B>' for the sticky
bit.
<P>

Thus, `<B>*(f70?)</B>' gives the files for which the owner has read,
write, and execute permission, and for which other group members have
no rights, independent of the permissions for other users. The pattern
`<B>*(f-100)</B>' gives all files for which the owner does not have
execute permission, and `<B>*(f:gu+w,o-rx:)</B>' gives the files for which 
the owner and the other members of the group have at least write
permission, and for which other users don't have read or execute
permission.
</DL>

<DT><B>e</B><I>string</I><DD>
The <I>string</I> will be executed as shell code.  The filename will be
included in the list if and only if the code returns a zero status (usually
the status of the last command).  The first character after the `<B>e</B>'
will be used as a separator and anything up to the next matching separator
will be taken  as the <I>string</I>; `<B>[</B>', `<B>{</B>', and `<B>&lt;</B>' match
`<B>]</B>', `<B>}</B>', and `<B>&gt;</B>', respectively, while any other character
matches itself. Note that expansions must be quoted in the <I>string</I>
to prevent them from being expanded before globbing is done.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

During the execution of <I>string</I> the filename currently being tested is
available in the parameter <B>REPLY</B>; the parameter may be altered to
a string to be inserted into the list instead of the original
filename.  In addition, the parameter <B>reply</B> may be set to an array or a
string, which overrides the value of <B>REPLY</B>.  If set to an array, the
latter is inserted into the command line word by word.
<P>

For example, suppose a directory contains a single file `<B>lonely</B>'.  Then
the expression `<B>*(e:'reply=(${REPLY}{1,2})':)</B>' will cause the words
`<B>lonely1 lonely2</B>' to be inserted into the command line.  Note the

match `<B>]</B>', `<B>}</B>', and `<B>&gt;</B>' respectively,
any other character matches

be taken (e.g. `<B>u:foo:</B>' or `<B>u[foo]</B>' for user `<B>foo</B>')
<DT><B>g</B><I>id</I><DD>

<DT><B>a</B>[<B>Mwhms</B>][<B>-</B>|<B>+</B>]<I>n</I><DD>
files accessed exactly <I>n</I> days ago.  Files accessed within the last
<I>n</I> days are selected using a negative value for <I>n</I> (<B>-</B><I>n</I>).
Files accessed more than <I>n</I> days ago are selected by a positive <I>n</I>
value (<B>+</B><I>n</I>).  Optional unit specifiers `<B>M</B>', `<B>w</B>',
`<B>h</B>', `<B>m</B>' or `<B>s</B>' (e.g. `<B>ah5</B>') cause the check to be
performed with months (of 30 days), weeks, hours, minutes or seconds
instead of days, respectively.  For instance, `<B>echo *(ah-5)</B>' would
echo files accessed within the last five hours.
<DT><B>m</B>[<B>Mwhms</B>][<B>-</B>|<B>+</B>]<I>n</I><DD>
like the file access qualifier, except that it uses the file modification
time.

like the file access qualifier, except that it uses the file inode change
time.
<DT><B>L</B>[<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>]<I>n</I><DD>
files less than <I>n</I> bytes (<B>-</B>), more than <I>n</I> bytes (<B>+</B>), or

(`<B>K</B>'), `<B>m</B>' (`<B>M</B>'), or `<B>p</B>' (`<B>P</B>') (e.g. `<B>Lk-50</B>')

specifies how the names of the files should be sorted. If <I>c</I> is
<B>n</B> they are sorted by name (the default); if it is <B>L</B> they
are sorted depending on the size (length) of the files; if <B>l</B> 
they are sorted by the number of links; if <B>a</B>, <B>m</B>, or <B>c</B>
they are sorted by the time of the last access, modification, or
inode change respectively; if <B>d</B>, files in subdirectories appear before
those in the current directory at each level of the search --- this is best
combined with other criteria, for example `<B>odon</B>' to sort on names for
files within the same directory.  Note that <B>a</B>, <B>m</B>, and <B>c</B> compare
the age against the current time, hence the first name in the list is the
youngest file. Also note that the modifiers <B>^</B> and <B>-</B> are used,
so `<B>*(^-oL)</B>' gives a list of all files sorted by file size in descending
order, following any symbolic links.
<DT><B>O</B><I>c</I><DD>
like `<B>o</B>', but sorts in descending order; i.e. `<B>*(^oc)</B>' is the
same as `<B>*(Oc)</B>' and `<B>*(^Oc)</B>' is the same as `<B>*(oc)</B>'; `<B>Od</B>'
puts files in the current directory before those in subdirectories at each
level of the search.
<DT><B>[</B><I>beg</I>[<B>,</B><I>end</I>]<B>]</B><DD>
specifies which of the matched filenames should be included in the
returned list. The syntax is the same as for array
subscripts. <I>beg</I> and the optional <I>end</I> may be mathematical
expressions. As in parameter subscripting they may be negative to make 
them count from the last match backward. E.g.: `<B>*(-OL[1,3])</B>'
gives a list of the names of the three largest files.
</DL>
<P>

More than one of these lists can be combined, separated by commas. The
whole list matches if at least one of the sublists matches (they are
`or'ed, the qualifiers in the sublists are `and'ed).  Some qualifiers,
however, affect all matches generated, independent of the sublist in
which they are given.  These are the qualifiers `<B>M</B>', `<B>T</B>',
`<B>N</B>', `<B>D</B>', `<B>n</B>', `<B>o</B>', `<B>O</B>' and the subscripts given
in brackets (`<B>[...]</B>').
<P>

If a `<B>:</B>' appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the expression in
parenthesis is interpreted as a modifier (see the section `Modifiers'
in the section `History Expansion').  Note that
each modifier must be introduced by a separate `<B>:</B>'.  Note also that the
result after modification does not have to be an existing file.  The
name of any existing file can be followed by a modifier of the form
`<B>(:..)</B>' even if no actual filename generation is performed.

<A NAME="lbCO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

zshparam - zsh parameters

<A NAME="lbCP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

A parameter has a name, a value, and a number of attributes.
A name may be any sequence of alphanumeric
characters and underscores, or the single characters
`<B>*</B>', `<B>@</B>', `<B>#</B>', `<B>?</B>', `<B>-</B>', `<B>$</B>', or `<B>!</B>'.
The value may be a <I>scalar</I> (a string),
an integer, an array (indexed numerically), or an <I>associative</I>
array (an unordered set of name-value pairs, indexed by name).  To declare
the type of a parameter, or to assign a scalar or integer value to a
parameter, use the <B>typeset</B> builtin.
<P>

The value of a scalar or integer parameter may also be assigned by
writing:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If the integer attribute, <B>-i</B>, is set for <I>name</I>, the <I>value</I>
is subject to arithmetic evaluation.  Furthermore, by replacing `<B>=</B>'
with `<B>+=</B>', a parameter can be added or appended to.  See
the section `Array Parameters' for additional forms of assignment.
<P>

To refer to the value of a parameter, write `<B>$</B><I>name</I>' or
`<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>}</B>'.  See
<I>Parameter Expansion</I> in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1)
for complete details.
<P>

In the parameter lists that follow, the mark `&lt;S&gt;' indicates that the
parameter is special.
Special parameters cannot have their type changed or their
readonly attribute turned off, and if a special parameter is unset, then
later recreated, the special properties will be retained.  `&lt;Z&gt;' indicates
that the parameter does not exist when the shell initializes in <B>sh</B> or
<B>ksh</B> emulation mode.
<A NAME="lbCQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ARRAY PARAMETERS</H2>

To assign an array value, write one of:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>set -A</B> <I>name</I> <I>value</I> ...
</PRE>

</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>name</I><B>=(</B><I>value</I> ...<B>)</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If no parameter <I>name</I> exists, an ordinary array parameter is created.
If the parameter <I>name</I> exists and is a scalar, it is replaced by a new
array.  Ordinary array parameters may also be explicitly declared with:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>typeset -a</B> <I>name</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Associative arrays <I>must</I> be declared before assignment, by using:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>typeset -A</B> <I>name</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

When <I>name</I> refers to an associative array, the list in an assignment
is interpreted as alternating keys and values:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
set -A <I>name</I> <I>key</I> <I>value</I> ...
</PRE>

</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>name</I><B>=(</B><I>key</I> <I>value</I> ...<B>)</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Every <I>key</I> must have a <I>value</I> in this case.  Note that this
assigns to the entire array, deleting any elements that do not appear
in the list.
<P>

To create an empty array (including associative arrays), use one of:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>set -A</B> <I>name</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>name</I><B>=()</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<A NAME="lbCR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Array Subscripts</H3>

<P>

Individual elements of an array may be selected using a subscript.  A
subscript of the form `<B>[</B><I>exp</I><B>]</B>' selects the single element
<I>exp</I>, where <I>exp</I> is an arithmetic expression which will be subject
to arithmetic expansion as if it were surrounded by
`<B>$((</B>...<B>))</B>'.  The elements are numbered
beginning with 1, unless the <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B> option is set in which case
they are numbered from zero.
<P>

Subscripts may be used inside braces used to delimit a parameter name, thus
`<B>${foo[2]}</B>' is equivalent to `<B>$foo[2]</B>'.  If the <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B>
option is set, the braced form is the only one that works, as bracketed
expressions otherwise are not treated as subscripts.
<P>

The same subscripting syntax is used for associative arrays, except that
no arithmetic expansion is applied to <I>exp</I>.  However, the parsing
rules for arithmetic expressions still apply, which affects the way that
certain special characters must be protected from interpretation.  See
<I>Subscript Parsing</I> below for details.
<P>

A subscript of the form `<B>[*]</B>' or `<B>[@]</B>' evaluates to all elements
of an array; there is no difference between the two except when they
appear within double quotes.
`<B>&quot;$foo[*]&quot;</B>' evaluates to `<B>&quot;$foo[1] $foo[2] </B>...<B>&quot;</B>', whereas
`<B>&quot;$foo[@]&quot;</B>' evaluates to `<B>&quot;$foo[1]&quot; &quot;$foo[2]&quot; </B>...'.  For
associative arrays, `<B>[*]</B>' or `<B>[@]</B>' evaluate to all the values,
in no particular order.  Note that this does not substitute
the keys; see the documentation for the `<B>k</B>' flag under
<I>Parameter Expansion Flags</I> in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1)
for complete details.
When an array parameter is referenced as `<B>$</B><I>name</I>' (with no
subscript) it evaluates to `<B>$</B><I>name</I><B>[*]</B>', unless the <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B>
option is set in which case it evaluates to `<B>${</B><I>name</I><B>[0]}</B>' (for
an associative array, this means the value of the key `<B>0</B>', which may
not exist even if there are values for other keys).
<P>

A subscript of the form `<B>[</B><I>exp1</I><B>,</B><I>exp2</I><B>]</B>'
selects all elements in the range <I>exp1</I> to <I>exp2</I>,
inclusive. (Associative arrays are unordered, and so do not support
ranges.) If one of the subscripts evaluates to a negative number,
say <B>-</B><I>n</I>, then the <I>n</I>th element from the end
of the array is used.  Thus `<B>$foo[-3]</B>' is the third element
from the end of the array <B>foo</B>, and
`<B>$foo[1,-1]</B>' is the same as `<B>$foo[*]</B>'.
<P>

Subscripting may also be performed on non-array values, in which
case the subscripts specify a substring to be extracted.
For example, if <B>FOO</B> is set to `<B>foobar</B>', then
`<B>echo $FOO[2,5]</B>' prints `<B>ooba</B>'.
<P>

<A NAME="lbCS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Array Element Assignment</H3>

<P>

A subscript may be used on the left side of an assignment like so:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>name</I><B>[</B><I>exp</I><B>]=</B><I>value</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

In this form of assignment the element or range specified by <I>exp</I>
is replaced by the expression on the right side.  An array (but not an
associative array) may be created by assignment to a range or element.
Arrays do not nest, so assigning a parenthesized list of values to an
element or range changes the number of elements in the array, shifting the
other elements to accommodate the new values.  (This is not supported for
associative arrays.)
<P>

This syntax also works as an argument to the <B>typeset</B> command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>typeset</B> <B>&quot;</B><I>name</I><B>[</B><I>exp</I><B>]&quot;=</B><I>value</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <I>value</I> may <I>not</I> be a parenthesized list in this case; only
single-element assignments may be made with <B>typeset</B>.  Note that quotes
are necessary in this case to prevent the brackets from being interpreted
as filename generation operators.  The <B>noglob</B> precommand modifier
could be used instead.
<P>

To delete an element of an ordinary array, assign `<B>()</B>' to
that element.  To delete an element of an associative array, use the
<B>unset</B> command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>unset</B> <B>&quot;</B><I>name</I><B>[</B><I>exp</I><B>]&quot;</B>

If the opening bracket, or the comma in a range, in any subscript
expression is directly followed by an opening parenthesis, the string up
to the matching closing one is considered to be a list of flags, as in
`<I>name</I><B>[(</B><I>flags</I><B>)</B><I>exp</I><B>]</B>'.  The flags
currently understood are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>w</B>
If the parameter subscripted is a scalar than this flag makes
subscripting work on words instead of characters.  The default word
separator is whitespace.
<DT><B>s:</B><I>string</I><B>:</B><DD>
This gives the <I>string</I> that separates words (for use with the
<B>w</B> flag).
<DT><B>p</B><DD>
Recognize the same escape sequences as the <B>print</B> builtin in
the string argument of a subsequent `<B>s</B>' flag.
<DT><B>f</B><DD>
If the parameter subscripted is a scalar than this flag makes
subscripting work on lines instead of characters, i.e. with elements
separated by newlines.  This is a shorthand for `<B>pws:\n:</B>'.
<DT><B>r</B><DD>
Reverse subscripting: if this flag is given, the <I>exp</I> is taken as a
pattern and the result is the first matching array element, substring or
word (if the parameter is an array, if it is a scalar, or if it is a
scalar and the `<B>w</B>' flag is given, respectively).  The subscript used
is the number of the matching element, so that pairs of subscripts such as
`<B>$foo[(r)</B><I>??</I><B>,3]</B>' and `<B>$foo[(r)</B><I>??</I><B>,(r)f*]</B>' are
possible.  If the parameter is an associative array, only the value part
of each pair is compared to the pattern, and the result is that value.
Reverse subscripts may be used for assigning to ordinary array elements,
but not for assigning to associative arrays.
<DT><B>R</B><DD>
Like `<B>r</B>', but gives the last match.  For associative arrays, gives
all possible matches.
<DT><B>i</B><DD>
Like `<B>r</B>', but gives the index of the match instead; this may not be
combined with a second argument.  On the left side of an assignment,
behaves like `<B>r</B>'.  For associative arrays, the key part of each pair
is compared to the pattern, and the first matching key found is the
result.
<DT><B>I</B><DD>
Like `<B>i</B>', but gives the index of the last match, or all possible
matching keys in an associative array.
<DT><B>k</B><DD>
If used in a subscript on an associative array, this flag causes the keys
to be interpreted as patterns, and returns the value for the first key
found where <I>exp</I> is matched by the key.  This flag does not work on
the left side of an assignment to an associative array element.  If used
on another type of parameter, this behaves like `<B>r</B>'.
<DT><B>K</B><DD>
On an associative array this is like `<B>k</B>' but returns all values where
<I>exp</I> is matched by the keys.  On other types of parameters this has
the same effect as `<B>R</B>'.
<DT><B>n:</B><I>expr</I><B>:</B><DD>
If combined with `<B>r</B>', `<B>R</B>', `<B>i</B>' or `<B>I</B>', makes them give
the <I>n</I>th or <I>n</I>th last match (if <I>expr</I> evaluates to
<I>n</I>).  This flag is ignored when the array is associative.
<DT><B>b:</B><I>expr</I><B>:</B><DD>
If combined with `<B>r</B>', `<B>R</B>', `<B>i</B>' or `<B>I</B>', makes them begin
at the <I>n</I>th or <I>n</I>th last element, word, or character (if <I>expr</I>
evaluates to <I>n</I>).  This flag is ignored when the array is associative.
<DT><B>e</B><DD>
This flag has no effect and for ordinary arrays is retained for backward
compatibility only.  For associative arrays, this flag can be used to
force <B>*</B> or <B>@</B> to be interpreted as a single key rather than as a
reference to all values.  This flag may be used on the left side of an
assignment.
</DL>

<H3>Subscript Parsing</H3>

<P>

This discussion applies mainly to associative array key strings and to
patterns used for reverse subscripting (the `<B>r</B>', `<B>R</B>', `<B>i</B>',
etc. flags), but it may also affect parameter substitutions that appear
as part of an arithmetic expression in an ordinary subscript.
<P>

It is possible to avoid the use of subscripts in assignments to associative
array elements by using the syntax:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>
   aa+=('key with &quot;*strange*&quot; characters' 'value string')
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This adds a new key/value pair if the key is not already present, and
replaces the value for the existing key if it is.
<P>

The basic rule to remember when writing a subscript expression is that all
text between the opening `<B>[</B>' and the closing `<B>]</B>' is interpreted
<I>as if</I> it were in double quotes (see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1)).  However, unlike double quotes which normally cannot nest, subscript
expressions may appear inside double-quoted strings or inside other
subscript expressions (or both!), so the rules have two important
differences.
<P>

The first difference is that brackets (`<B>[</B>' and `<B>]</B>') must appear as
balanced pairs in a subscript expression unless they are preceded by a
backslash (`<B>\</B>').  Therefore, within a subscript expression (and unlike
true double-quoting) the sequence `<B>\[</B>' becomes `<B>[</B>', and similarly
`<B>\]</B>' becomes `<B>]</B>'.  This applies even in cases where a backslash is
not normally required; for example, the pattern `<B>[^[]</B>' (to match any
character other than an open bracket) should be written `<B>[^\[]</B>' in a
reverse-subscript pattern.  However, note that `<B>\[^\[\]</B>' and even
`<B>\[^[]</B>' mean the <I>same</I> thing, because backslashes are always
stripped when they appear before brackets!
<P>

The same rule applies to parentheses (`<B>(</B>' and `<B>)</B>') and
braces (`<B>{</B>' and `<B>}</B>'): they must appear either in balanced pairs or
preceded by a backslash, and backslashes that protect parentheses or
braces are removed during parsing.  This is because parameter expansions
may be surrounded balanced braces, and subscript flags are introduced by
balanced parenthesis.
<P>

The second difference is that a double-quote (`<B>&quot;</B>') may appear as part
of a subscript expression without being preceded by a backslash, and
therefore that the two characters `<B>\&quot;</B>' remain as two characters in the
subscript (in true double-quoting, `<B>\&quot;</B>' becomes `<B>&quot;</B>').  However,
because of the standard shell quoting rules, any double-quotes that appear
must occur in balanced pairs unless preceded by a backslash.  This makes
it more difficult to write a subscript expression that contains an odd
number of double-quote characters, but the reason for this difference is
so that when a subscript expression appears inside true double-quotes, one
can still write `<B>\&quot;</B>' (rather than `<B>\\\&quot;</B>') for `<B>&quot;</B>'.
<P>

To use an odd number of double quotes as a key in an assignment, use the
<B>typeset</B> builtin and an enclosing pair of double quotes; to refer to
the value of that key, again use double quotes:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>typeset -A aa
typeset &quot;aa[one\&quot;two\&quot;three\&quot;quotes]&quot;=QQQ
print &quot;$aa[one\&quot;two\&quot;three\&quot;quotes]&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

It is important to note that the quoting rules do not change when a
parameter expansion with a subscript is nested inside another subscript
expression.  That is, it is not necessary to use additional backslashes
within the inner subscript expression; they are removed only once, from
the innermost subscript outwards.  Parameters are also expanded from the
innermost subscript first, as each expansion is encountered left to right
in the outer expression.
<P>

A further complication arises from a way in which subscript parsing is
<I>not</I> different from double quote parsing.  As in true double-quoting,
the sequences `<B>\*</B>', and `<B>\@</B>' remain as two characters when they
appear in a subscript expression.  To use a literal `<B>*</B>' or `<B>@</B>' as
an associative array key, the `<B>e</B>' flag must be used:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>typeset -A aa
aa[(e)*]=star
print $aa[(e)*]</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

A last detail must be considered when reverse subscripting is performed.
Parameters appearing in the subscript expression are first expanded and
then the complete expression is interpreted as a pattern.  This has two
effects: first, parameters behave as if <B>GLOB_SUBST</B> were on (and it
cannot be turned off); second, backslashes are interpreted twice, once
when parsing the array subscript and again when parsing the pattern.  In a
reverse subscript, it's necessary to use <I>four</I> backslashes to cause a
single backslash to match literally in the pattern.  For complex patterns,
it is often easiest to assign the desired pattern to a parameter and then
refer to that parameter in the subscript, because then the backslashes,
brackets, parentheses, etc., are seen only when the complete expression is
converted to a pattern.  To match the value of a parameter literally in a
reverse subscript, rather than as a pattern,
use `<B>${(q</B><B>)</B><I>name</I><B>}</B>' (see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1)) to quote the expanded value.
<P>

Note that the `<B>k</B>' and `<B>K</B>' flags are reverse subscripting for an
ordinary array, but are <I>not</I> reverse subscripting for an associative
array!  (For an associative array, the keys in the array itself are
interpreted as patterns by those flags; the subscript is a plain string
in that case.)
<P>

One final note, not directly related to subscripting: the numeric names
of positional parameters (described below) are parsed specially, so for example `<B>$2foo</B>' is equivalent to
`<B>${2}foo</B>'.  Therefore, to use subscript syntax to extract a substring
from a positional parameter, the expansion must be surrounded by braces;
for example, `<B>${2[3,5]}</B>' evaluates to the third through fifth
characters of the second positional parameter, but `<B>$2[3,5]</B>' is the
entire second parameter concatenated with the filename generation pattern
`<B>[3,5]</B>'.
<P>

<A NAME="lbCV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>POSITIONAL PARAMETERS</H2>

The positional parameters provide access to the command-line arguments
of a shell function, shell script, or the shell itself; see
the section `Invocation', and also the section `Functions'.
The parameter <I>n</I>, where <I>n</I> is a number,
is the <I>n</I>th positional parameter.
The parameters <B>*</B>, <B>@</B> and <B>argv</B> are
arrays containing all the positional parameters;
thus `<B>$argv[</B><I>n</I><B>]</B>', etc., is equivalent to simply `<B>$</B><I>n</I>'.
<P>

Positional parameters may be changed after the shell or function starts by
using the <B>set</B> builtin, by assigning to the <B>argv</B> array, or by direct
assignment of the form `<I>n</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>' where <I>n</I> is the number of
the positional parameter to be changed.  This also creates (with empty
values) any of the positions from 1 to <I>n</I> that do not already have
values.  Note that, because the positional parameters form an array, an
array assignment of the form `<I>n</I><B>=(</B><I>value</I> ...<B>)</B>' is
allowed, and has the effect of shifting all the values at positions greater
than <I>n</I> by as many positions as necessary to accommodate the new values.
<P>

<A NAME="lbCW">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LOCAL PARAMETERS</H2>

Shell function executions delimit scopes for shell parameters.
(Parameters are dynamically scoped.)  The <B>typeset</B> builtin, and its
alternative forms <B>declare</B>, <B>integer</B>, <B>local</B> and <B>readonly</B>
(but not <B>export</B>), can be used to declare a parameter as being local
to the innermost scope.
<P>

When a parameter is read or assigned to, the
innermost existing parameter of that name is used.  (That is, the
local parameter hides any less-local parameter.)  However, assigning
to a non-existent parameter, or declaring a new parameter with <B>export</B>,
causes it to be created in the <I>outer</I>most scope.
<P>

Local parameters disappear when their scope ends.
<B>unset</B> can be used to delete a parameter while it is still in scope;
any outer parameter of the same name remains hidden.
<P>

Special parameters may also be made local; they retain their special
attributes unless either the existing or the newly-created parameter
has the <B>-h</B> (hide) attribute.  This may have unexpected effects:
there is no default value, so if there is no assignment at the
point the variable is made local, it will be set to an empty value (or zero
in the case of integers).  
The following:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>typeset PATH=/new/directory:$PATH</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is valid for temporarily allowing the shell or programmes called from it to
find the programs in <B>/new/directory</B> inside a function.
<P>

Note that the restriction in older versions of zsh that local parameters
were never exported has been removed.
<P>

<A NAME="lbCX">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PARAMETERS SET BY THE SHELL</H2>

The following parameters are automatically set by the shell:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>!</B> &lt;S&gt;
The process ID of the last background command invoked.
<DT><B>#</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The number of positional parameters in decimal.  Note that some confusion
may occur with the syntax <B>$#</B><I>param</I> which substitutes the length of
<I>param</I>.  Use <B>${#}</B> to resolve ambiguities.  In particular, the
sequence `<B>$#-</B><I>...</I>' in an arithmetic expression is interpreted as
the length of the parameter <B>-</B>, q.v.
<DT><B>ARGC</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Same as <B>#</B>.
<DT><B>$</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The process ID of this shell.
<DT><B>-</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Flags supplied to the shell on invocation or by the <B>set</B>
or <B>setopt</B> commands.
<DT><B>*</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
An array containing the positional parameters.
<DT><B>argv</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Same as <B>*</B>.  Assigning to <B>argv</B> changes the local positional
parameters, but <B>argv</B> is <I>not</I> itself a local parameter.
Deleting <B>argv</B> with <B>unset</B> in any function deletes it everywhere,
although only the innermost positional parameter array is deleted (so
<B>*</B> and <B>@</B> in other scopes are not affected).
<DT><B>@</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Same as <B>argv[@]</B>, even when <B>argv</B> is not set.
<DT><B>?</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The exit value returned by the last command.
<DT><B>0</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The name used to invoke the current shell.  If the <B>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</B> option
is set, this is set temporarily within a shell function to the name of the
function, and within a sourced script to the name of the script.
<DT><B>status</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Same as <B>?</B>.
<DT><B>pipestatus</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
An array containing the exit values returned by all commands in the
last pipeline.
<DT><B>_</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The last argument of the previous command.
Also, this parameter is set in the environment of every command
executed to the full pathname of the command.
<DT><B>CPUTYPE</B><DD>
The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model),
as determined at run time.
<DT><B>EGID</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The effective group ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient
privileges, you may change the effective group ID of the shell
process by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient
privileges), you may start a single command with a different
effective group ID by `<B>(EGID=</B><I>gid</I><B>; command)</B>'
<DT><B>EUID</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The effective user ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient
privileges, you may change the effective user ID of the shell process
by assigning to this parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient privileges),
you may start a single command with a different
effective user ID by `<B>(EUID=</B><I>uid</I><B>; command)</B>'
<DT><B>ERRNO</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The value of errno (see <I><A HREF="../man3/errno.3.php">errno</A></I>(3))
as set by the most recently failed system call.
This value is system dependent and is intended for debugging
purposes.  It is also useful with the <B>zsh/system</B> module which
allows the number to be turned into a name or message.
<DT><B>GID</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The real group ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges,
you may change the group ID of the shell process by assigning to this
parameter.  Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a single
command under a different
group ID by `<B>(GID=</B><I>gid</I><B>; command)</B>'
<DT><B>HOST</B><DD>
The current hostname.
<DT><B>LINENO</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The line number of the current line within the current script, sourced
file, or shell function being executed, whichever was started most
recently.  Note that in the case of shell functions the line
number refers to the function as it appeared in the original definition,
not necessarily as displayed by the <B>functions</B> builtin.
<DT><B>LOGNAME</B><DD>
If the corresponding variable is not set in the environment of the
shell, it is initialized to the login name corresponding to the
current login session. This parameter is exported by default but
this can be disabled using the <B>typeset</B> builtin.
<DT><B>MACHTYPE</B><DD>
The machine type (microprocessor class or machine model),
as determined at compile time.
<DT><B>OLDPWD</B><DD>
The previous working directory.  This is set when the shell initializes
and whenever the directory changes.
<DT><B>OPTARG</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The value of the last option argument processed by the <B>getopts</B>
command.
<DT><B>OPTIND</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The index of the last option argument processed by the <B>getopts</B>
command.
<DT><B>OSTYPE</B><DD>
The operating system, as determined at compile time.
<DT><B>PPID</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The process ID of the parent of the shell.
<DT><B>PWD</B><DD>
The present working directory.  This is set when the shell initializes
and whenever the directory changes.
<DT><B>RANDOM</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
A pseudo-random integer from 0 to 32767, newly generated each time
this parameter is referenced.  The random number generator
can be seeded by assigning a numeric value to <B>RANDOM</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The values of <B>RANDOM</B> form an intentionally-repeatable pseudo-random
sequence; subshells that reference <B>RANDOM</B> will result
in identical pseudo-random values unless the value of <B>RANDOM</B> is
referenced or seeded in the parent shell in between subshell invocations.
</DL>

<DT><B>SECONDS</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The number of seconds since shell invocation.  If this parameter
is assigned a value, then the value returned upon reference
will be the value that was assigned plus the number of seconds
since the assignment.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Unlike other special parameters, the type of the <B>SECONDS</B> parameter can
be changed using the <B>typeset</B> command.  Only integer and one of the
floating point types are allowed.  For example, `<B>typeset -F SECONDS</B>'
causes the value to be reported as a floating point number.  The precision
is six decimal places, although not all places may be useful.
</DL>

<DT><B>SHLVL</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Incremented by one each time a new shell is started.
<DT><B>signals</B><DD>
An array containing the names of the signals.
<DT><B>TTY</B><DD>
The name of the tty associated with the shell, if any.
<DT><B>TTYIDLE</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The idle time of the tty associated with the shell in seconds or -1 if there
is no such tty.
<DT><B>UID</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The real user ID of the shell process.  If you have sufficient privileges,
you may change the user ID of the shell by assigning to this parameter.
Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a single command
under a different
user ID by `<B>(UID=</B><I>uid</I><B>; command)</B>'
<DT><B>USERNAME</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The username corresponding to the real user ID of the shell process.  If you
have sufficient privileges, you may change the username (and also the
user ID and group ID) of the shell by assigning to this parameter.
Also (assuming sufficient privileges), you may start a single command
under a different username (and user ID and group ID)
by `<B>(USERNAME=</B><I>username</I><B>; command)</B>'
<DT><B>VENDOR</B><DD>
The vendor, as determined at compile time.
<DT><B>ZSH_NAME</B><DD>
Expands to the basename of the command used to invoke this instance
of zsh.
<DT><B>ZSH_VERSION</B><DD>
The version number of this zsh.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbCY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PARAMETERS USED BY THE SHELL</H2>

The following parameters are used by the shell.
<P>

In cases where there are two parameters with an upper- and lowercase
form of the same name, such as <B>path</B> and <B>PATH</B>, the lowercase form
is an array and the uppercase form is a scalar with the elements of the
array joined together by colons.  These are similar to tied parameters
created via `<B>typeset -T</B>'.  The normal use for the colon-separated
form is for exporting to the environment, while the array form is easier
to manipulate within the shell.  Note that unsetting either of the pair
will unset the other; they retain their special properties when
recreated, and recreating one of the pair will recreate the other.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>ARGV0</B>
If exported, its value is used as the <B>argv[0]</B> of external commands.
Usually used in constructs like `<B>ARGV0=emacs nethack</B>'.
<DT><B>BAUD</B><DD>
The baud rate of the current connection.  Used by the line editor
update mechanism to compensate for a slow terminal by delaying
updates until necessary.  This may be profitably set to a lower value
in some circumstances, e.g.
for slow modems dialing into a communications server which is connected
to a host via a fast link; in this case, this variable
would be set by default to the speed of the fast link, and not
the modem.
This parameter should be set to the baud
rate of the slowest part of the link for best performance. The compensation
mechanism can be turned off by setting the variable to zero.
<DT><B>cdpath</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>CDPATH</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon-separated list)
of directories specifying the search path for the <B>cd</B> command.
<DT><B>COLUMNS</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The number of columns for this terminal session.
Used for printing select lists and for the line editor.
<DT><B>DIRSTACKSIZE</B><DD>
The maximum size of the directory stack.  If the
stack gets larger than this, it will be truncated automatically.
This is useful with the <B>AUTO_PUSHD</B> option.
<DT><B>ENV</B><DD>
If the <B>ENV</B> environment variable is set when zsh is invoked as <B>sh</B>
or <B>ksh</B>, <B>$ENV</B> is sourced after the profile scripts.  The value of
<B>ENV</B> is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and
arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a pathname.  Note that
<B>ENV</B> is <I>not</I> used unless zsh is emulating <B>sh</B> or <B>ksh</B>.
<DT><B>FCEDIT</B><DD>
The default editor for the <B>fc</B> builtin.
<DT><B>fignore</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>FIGNORE</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon separated list)
containing the suffixes of files to be ignored
during filename completion.  However, if completion only generates files
with suffixes in this list, then these files are completed anyway.
<DT><B>fpath</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>FPATH</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon separated list)
of directories specifying the search path for
function definitions.  This path is searched when a function
with the <B>-u</B> attribute is referenced.  If an executable
file is found, then it is read and executed in the current environment.
<DT><B>histchars</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Three characters used by the shell's history and lexical analysis
mechanism.  The first character signals the start of a history
expansion (default `<B>!</B>').  The second character signals the
start of a quick history substitution (default `<B>^</B>').  The third
character is the comment character (default `<B>#</B>').
<DT><B>HISTCHARS</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Same as <B>histchars</B>.  (Deprecated.)
<DT><B>HISTFILE</B><DD>
The file to save the history in when an interactive shell exits.
If unset, the history is not saved.
<DT><B>HISTSIZE</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The maximum number of events stored in the internal history list.
If you use the <B>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</B> option, setting this value
larger than the <B>SAVEHIST</B> size will give you the difference as a
cushion for saving duplicated history events.
<DT><B>HOME</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The default argument for the <B>cd</B> command.
<DT><B>IFS</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Internal field separators (by default space, tab, newline and NUL), that
are used to separate words which result from
command or parameter expansion and words read by
the <B>read</B> builtin.  Any characters from the set space, tab and
newline that appear in the IFS are called <I>IFS white space</I>.
One or more IFS white space characters or one non-IFS white space
character together with any adjacent IFS white space character delimit
a field.  If an IFS white space character appears twice consecutively
in the IFS, this character is treated as if it were not an IFS white
space character.
<DT><B>KEYTIMEOUT</B><DD>
The time the shell waits, in hundredths of seconds, for another key to
be pressed when reading bound multi-character sequences.
<DT><B>LANG</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This variable determines the locale category for any category not
specifically selected via a variable starting with `<B>LC_</B>'.
<DT><B>LC_ALL</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This variable overrides the value of the `<B>LANG</B>' variable and the value
of any of the other variables starting with `<B>LC_</B>'.
<DT><B>LC_COLLATE</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This variable determines the locale category for character collation
information within ranges in glob brackets and for sorting.
<DT><B>LC_CTYPE</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This variable determines the locale category for character handling
functions.
<DT><B>LC_MESSAGES</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This variable determines the language in which messages should be
written.  Note that zsh does not use message catalogs.
<DT><B>LC_NUMERIC</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This variable affects the decimal point character and thousands
separator character for the formatted input/output functions
and string conversion functions.  Note that zsh ignores this
setting when parsing floating point mathematical expressions.
<DT><B>LC_TIME</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This variable determines the locale category for date and time
formatting in prompt escape sequences.
<DT><B>LINES</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The number of lines for this terminal session.
Used for printing select lists and for the line editor.
<DT><B>LISTMAX</B><DD>
In the line editor, the number of matches to list without asking
first. If the value is negative, the list will be shown if it spans at 
most as many lines as given by the absolute value.
If set to zero, the shell asks only if the top of the listing would scroll
off the screen.
<DT><B>LOGCHECK</B><DD>
The interval in seconds between checks for login/logout activity
using the <B>watch</B> parameter.
<DT><B>MAIL</B><DD>
If this parameter is set and <B>mailpath</B> is not set,
the shell looks for mail in the specified file.
<DT><B>MAILCHECK</B><DD>
The interval in seconds between checks for new mail.
<DT><B>mailpath</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>MAILPATH</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon-separated list) of filenames to check for
new mail.  Each filename can be followed by a `<B>?</B>' and a
message that will be printed.  The message will undergo
parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic
expansion with the variable <B>$_</B> defined as the name
of the file that has changed.  The default message is
`<B>You have new mail</B>'.  If an element is a directory
instead of a file the shell will recursively check every
file in every subdirectory of the element.
<DT><B>manpath</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>MANPATH</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon-separated list)
whose value is not used by the shell.  The <B>manpath</B>
array can be useful, however, since setting it also sets
<B>MANPATH</B>, and vice versa.
<DT><B>module_path</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>MODULE_PATH</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon-separated list)
of directories that <B>zmodload</B>
searches for dynamically loadable modules.
This is initialized to a standard pathname,
usually `<B>/usr/local/lib/zsh/$ZSH_VERSION</B>'.
(The `<B>/usr/local/lib</B>' part varies from installation to installation.)
For security reasons, any value set in the environment when the shell
is started will be ignored.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

These parameters only exist if the installation supports dynamic
module loading.
</DL>

<DT><B>NULLCMD</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The command name to assume if a redirection is specified
with no command.  Defaults to <B>cat</B>.  For <B>sh</B>/<B>ksh</B>
behavior, change this to <B>:</B>.  For <B>csh</B>-like
behavior, unset this parameter; the shell will print an
error message if null commands are entered.
<DT><B>path</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>PATH</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon-separated list)
of directories to search for commands.
When this parameter is set, each directory is scanned
and all files found are put in a hash table.
<DT><B>POSTEDIT</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
This string is output whenever the line editor exits.
It usually contains termcap strings to reset the terminal.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>PROMPT</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<DT>
<DD>
<B>PROMPT2</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<DT>
<DD>
<B>PROMPT3</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
<DT>
<DD>
<B>PROMPT4</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;
Same as <B>PS1</B>, <B>PS2</B>, <B>PS3</B> and <B>PS4</B>,
respectively.
<DT><B>prompt</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Same as <B>PS1</B>.
<DT><B>PS1</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The primary prompt string, printed before a command is read.
the default is `<B>%m%# </B>'.  It undergoes a special form of expansion
before being displayed; see the section `Prompt Expansion'.
<DT><B>PS2</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The secondary prompt, printed when the shell needs more information
to complete a command.
It is expanded in the same way as <B>PS1</B>.
The default is `<B>%_&gt; </B>', which displays any shell constructs or quotation
marks which are currently being processed.
<DT><B>PS3</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Selection prompt used within a <B>select</B> loop.
It is expanded in the same way as <B>PS1</B>.
The default is `<B>?# </B>'.
<DT><B>PS4</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The execution trace prompt.  Default is `<B>+%N:%i&gt; </B>', which displays
the name of the current shell structure and the line number within it.
In sh or ksh emulation, the default is `<B>+ </B>'.
<DT><B>psvar</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>PSVAR</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon-separated list) whose first nine values can be used in
<B>PROMPT</B> strings.  Setting <B>psvar</B> also sets <B>PSVAR</B>, and
vice versa.
<DT><B>READNULLCMD</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The command name to assume if a single input redirection
is specified with no command.  Defaults to <B>more</B>.
<DT><B>REPORTTIME</B><DD>
If nonnegative, commands whose combined user and system execution times
(measured in seconds) are greater than this value have timing
statistics printed for them.
<DT><B>REPLY</B><DD>
This parameter is reserved by convention to pass string values between
shell scripts and shell builtins in situations where a function call or
redirection are impossible or undesirable.  The <B>read</B> builtin and the
<B>select</B> complex command may set <B>REPLY</B>, and filename generation both
sets and examines its value when evaluating certain expressions.  Some
modules also employ <B>REPLY</B> for similar purposes.
<DT><B>reply</B><DD>
As <B>REPLY</B>, but for array values rather than strings.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>RPROMPT</B> &lt;S&gt;
<DT>
<DD>
<B>RPS1</B> &lt;S&gt;
This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen
when the primary prompt is being displayed on the left.
This does not work if the <B>SINGLELINEZLE</B> option is set.
It is expanded in the same way as <B>PS1</B>.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>RPROMPT2</B> &lt;S&gt;
<DT>
<DD>
<B>RPS2</B> &lt;S&gt;
This prompt is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen
when the secondary prompt is being displayed on the left.
This does not work if the <B>SINGLELINEZLE</B> option is set.
It is expanded in the same way as <B>PS2</B>.
<DT><B>SAVEHIST</B><DD>
The maximum number of history events to save in the history file.
<DT><B>SPROMPT</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The prompt used for spelling correction.  The sequence
`<B>%R</B>' expands to the string which presumably needs spelling
correction, and `<B>%r</B>' expands to the proposed correction.
All other prompt escapes are also allowed.
<DT><B>STTY</B><DD>
If this parameter is set in a command's environment, the shell runs the
<B>stty</B> command with the value of this parameter as arguments in order to
set up the terminal before executing the command. The modes apply only to the
command, and are reset when it finishes or is suspended. If the command is
suspended and continued later with the <B>fg</B> or <B>wait</B> builtins it will
see the modes specified by <B>STTY</B>, as if it were not suspended.  This
(intentionally) does not apply if the command is continued via `<B>kill
-CONT</B>'.  <B>STTY</B> is ignored if the command is run in the background, or
if it is in the environment of the shell but not explicitly assigned to in
the input line. This avoids running stty at every external command by
accidentally exporting it. Also note that <B>STTY</B> should not be used for
window size specifications; these will not be local to the command.
<DT><B>TERM</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
The type of terminal in use.  This is used when looking up termcap
sequences.  An assignment to <B>TERM</B> causes zsh to re-initialize the
terminal, even if the value does not change (e.g., `<B>TERM=$TERM</B>').  It
is necessary to make such an assignment upon any change to the terminal
definition database or terminal type in order for the new settings to
take effect.
<DT><B>TIMEFMT</B><DD>
The format of process time reports with the <B>time</B> keyword.
The default is `<B>%E real  %U user  %S system  %P %J</B>'.
Recognizes the following escape sequences:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>%%</B><DD>
A `<B>%</B>'.
<DT><B>%U</B><DD>
CPU seconds spent in user mode.
<DT><B>%S</B><DD>
CPU seconds spent in kernel mode.
<DT><B>%E</B><DD>
Elapsed time in seconds.
<DT><B>%P</B><DD>
The CPU percentage, computed as (<B>%U</B>+<B>%S</B>)/<B>%E</B>.
<DT><B>%J</B><DD>
The name of this job.

</DL>
<P>

A star may be inserted between the percent sign and flags printing time.
This cause the time to be printed in
`<I>hh</I><B>:</B><I>mm</I><B>:</B><I>ss</I><B>.</B><I>ttt</I>'
format (hours and minutes are only printed if they are not zero).
</DL>

<DT><B>TMOUT</B><DD>
If this parameter is nonzero, the shell will receive an <B>ALRM</B>
signal if a command is not entered within the specified number of
seconds after issuing a prompt. If there is a trap on <B>SIGALRM</B>, it
will be executed and a new alarm is scheduled using the value of the
<B>TMOUT</B> parameter after executing the trap.  If no trap is set, and
the idle time of the terminal is not less than the value of the
<B>TMOUT</B> parameter, zsh terminates.  Otherwise a new alarm is
scheduled to <B>TMOUT</B> seconds after the last keypress.
<DT><B>TMPPREFIX</B><DD>
A pathname prefix which the shell will use for all temporary files.
Note that this should include an initial part for the file name as
well as any directory names.  The default is `<B>/tmp/zsh</B>'.
<DT><B>watch</B> &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt; (<B>WATCH</B> &lt;S&gt;)<DD>
An array (colon-separated list) of login/logout events to report.
If it contains the single word `<B>all</B>', then all login/logout events
are reported.  If it contains the single word `<B>notme</B>', then all
events are reported as with `<B>all</B>' except <B>$USERNAME</B>.
An entry in this list may consist of a username,
an `<B>@</B>' followed by a remote hostname,
and a `<B>%</B>' followed by a line (tty).
Any or all of these components may be present in an entry;
if a login/logout event matches all of them,
it is reported.
<DT><B>WATCHFMT</B><DD>
The format of login/logout reports if the <B>watch</B> parameter is set.
Default is `<B>%n has %a %l from %m</B>'.
Recognizes the following escape sequences:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%n</B>
The name of the user that logged in/out.
<DT><B>%a</B><DD>
The observed action, i.e. &quot;logged on&quot; or &quot;logged off&quot;.
<DT><B>%l</B><DD>
The line (tty) the user is logged in on.
<DT><B>%M</B><DD>
The full hostname of the remote host.
<DT><B>%m</B><DD>
The hostname up to the first `<B>.</B>'.  If only the
IP address is available or the utmp field contains
the name of an X-windows display, the whole name is printed.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<I>NOTE:</I>
The `<B>%m</B>' and `<B>%M</B>' escapes will work only if there is a host name
field in the utmp on your machine.  Otherwise they are
treated as ordinary strings.
</DL>

<DT><B>%S</B> (<B>%s</B>)<DD>
Start (stop) standout mode.
<DT><B>%U</B> (<B>%u</B>)<DD>
Start (stop) underline mode.
<DT><B>%B</B> (<B>%b</B>)<DD>
Start (stop) boldface mode.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%t</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%@</B>
The time, in 12-hour, am/pm format.
<DT><B>%T</B><DD>
The time, in 24-hour format.
<DT><B>%w</B><DD>
The date in `<I>day</I><B>-</B><I>dd</I>' format.
<DT><B>%W</B><DD>
The date in `<I>mm</I><B>/</B><I>dd</I><B>/</B><I>yy</I>' format.
<DT><B>%D</B><DD>
The date in `<I>yy</I><B>-</B><I>mm</I><B>-</B><I>dd</I>' format.
<DT><B>%(</B><I>x</I><B>:</B><I>true-text</I><B>:</B><I>false-text</I><B>)</B><DD>
Specifies a ternary expression.
The character following the <I>x</I> is
arbitrary; the same character is used to separate the text
for the &quot;true&quot; result from that for the &quot;false&quot; result.
Both the separator and the right parenthesis may be escaped
with a backslash.
Ternary expressions may be nested.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The test character <I>x</I> may be any one of `<B>l</B>', `<B>n</B>', `<B>m</B>'
or `<B>M</B>', which indicate a `true' result if the corresponding
escape sequence would return a non-empty value; or it may be `<B>a</B>',
which indicates a `true' result if the watched user has logged in,
or `false' if he has logged out.
Other characters evaluate to neither true nor false; the entire
expression is omitted in this case.
<P>

If the result is `true', then the <I>true-text</I>
is formatted according to the rules above and printed,
and the <I>false-text</I> is skipped.
If `false', the <I>true-text</I> is skipped and the <I>false-text</I>
is formatted and printed.
Either or both of the branches may be empty, but
both separators must be present in any case.
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>


<DT><B>WORDCHARS</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
A list of non-alphanumeric characters considered part of a word
by the line editor.
<DT><B>ZBEEP</B><DD>
If set, this gives a string of characters, which can use all the same codes
as the <B>bindkey</B> command as described in
the zsh/zle module entry in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1), that will be output to the terminal
instead of beeping.  This may have a visible instead of an audible effect;
for example, the string `<B>\e[?5h\e[?5l</B>' on a vt100 or xterm will have
the effect of flashing reverse video on and off (if you usually use reverse
video, you should use the string `<B>\e[?5l\e[?5h</B>' instead).  This takes
precedence over the <B>NOBEEP</B> option.
<DT><B>ZDOTDIR</B><DD>
The directory to search for shell startup files (.zshrc, etc),
if not <B>$HOME</B>.


</DL>
<A NAME="lbCZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

zshoptions - zsh options

<A NAME="lbDA">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SPECIFYING OPTIONS</H2>

Options are primarily referred to by name.
These names are case insensitive and underscores are ignored.
For example, `<B>allexport</B>' is equivalent to `<B>A__lleXP_ort</B>'.
<P>

The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with
`<B>no</B>', so `<B>setopt No_Beep</B>' is equivalent to `<B>unsetopt beep</B>'.
This inversion can only be done once, so `<B>nonobeep</B>' is <I>not</I>
a synonym for `<B>beep</B>'.  Similarly, `<B>tify</B>' is not a synonym for
`<B>nonotify</B>' (the inversion of `<B>notify</B>').
<P>

Some options also have one or more single letter names.
There are two sets of single letter options: one used by default,
and another used to emulate <B>sh</B>/<B>ksh</B> (used when the
<B>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</B> option is set).
The single letter options can be used on the shell command line,
or with the <B>set</B>, <B>setopt</B> and <B>unsetopt</B>
builtins, as normal Unix options preceded by `<B>-</B>'.
<P>

The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using
`<B>+</B>' instead of `<B>-</B>'.
Some of the single letter option names refer to an option being off,
in which case the inversion of that name refers to the option being on.
For example, `<B>+n</B>' is the short name of `<B>exec</B>', and
`<B>-n</B>' is the short name of its inversion, `<B>noexec</B>'.
<P>

In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at startup,
trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string `<B>-f    </B>'
will be treated just as `<B>-f</B>', but the string `<B>-f i</B>' is an error.
This is because many systems which implement the `<B>#!</B>' mechanism for
calling scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.
<P>

<A NAME="lbDB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS</H2>

In the following list, options set by default in all emulations are marked
&lt;D&gt;; those set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations are marked
&lt;C&gt;, &lt;K&gt;, &lt;S&gt;, &lt;Z&gt; as appropriate.  When listing options (by `<B>setopt</B>',
`<B>unsetopt</B>', `<B>set -o</B>' or `<B>set +o</B>'), those turned on by default
appear in the list prefixed with `<B>no</B>'.  Hence (unless
<B>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</B> is set), `<B>setopt</B>' shows all options whose settings
are changed from the default.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>ALIASES</B> &lt;D&gt;
Expand aliases.
<DT><B>ALL_EXPORT</B> (<B>-a</B>, ksh: <B>-a</B>)<DD>
All parameters subsequently defined are automatically exported.
<DT><B>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
If unset, key functions that list completions try to return to the last
prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these functions try to
return to the last prompt if given <I>no</I> numeric argument.
<DT><B>ALWAYS_TO_END</B><DD>
If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word, and a
full completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the end of the
word.  That is, the cursor is moved to the end of the word if either
a single match is inserted or menu completion is performed.
<DT><B>APPEND_HISTORY</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
If this is set, zsh sessions will append their history list to
the history file, rather than overwrite it. Thus, multiple parallel
zsh sessions will all have their history lists added to the
history file, in the order they are killed.
<DT><B>AUTO_CD</B> (<B>-J</B>)<DD>
If a command is issued that can't be executed as a normal command,
and the command is the name of a directory, perform the <B>cd</B>
command to that directory.
<DT><B>AUTO_CONTINUE</B><DD>
With this option set, stopped jobs that are removed from the job table
with the <B>disown</B> builtin command are automatically sent a <B>CONT</B>
signal to make them running.
<DT><B>AUTO_LIST</B> (<B>-9</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.
<DT><B>AUTO_MENU</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Automatically use menu completion after the second consecutive request for
completion, for example by pressing the tab key repeatedly. This option
is overridden by <B>MENU_COMPLETE</B>.
<DT><B>AUTO_NAME_DIRS</B><DD>
Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory
immediately becomes a name for that directory, that will be used
by the `<B>%~</B>'
and related prompt sequences, and will be available when completion
is performed on a word starting with `<B>~</B>'.
(Otherwise, the parameter must be used in the form `<B>~</B><I>param</I>' first.)
<DT><B>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
If a parameter name was completed and a following character
(normally a space) automatically
inserted, and the next character typed is one
of those that have to come directly after the name (like `<B>}</B>', `<B>:</B>',
etc.), the automatically added character is deleted, so that the character
typed comes immediately after the parameter name.
Completion in a brace expansion is affected similarly: the added character
is a `<B>,</B>', which will be removed if `<B>}</B>' is typed next.
<DT><B>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
If a parameter is completed whose content is the name of a directory,
then add a trailing slash instead of a space.
<DT><B>AUTO_PUSHD</B> (<B>-N</B>)<DD>
Make <B>cd</B> push the old directory onto the directory stack.
<DT><B>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
When the last character resulting from a completion is a slash and the next
character typed is a word delimiter, a slash, or a character that ends 
a command (such as a semicolon or an ampersand), remove the slash.
<DT><B>AUTO_RESUME</B> (<B>-W</B>)<DD>
Treat single word simple commands without redirection
as candidates for resumption of an existing job.
<DT><B>BAD_PATTERN</B> (<B>+2</B>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
If a pattern for filename generation is badly formed, print an error message.
(If this option is unset, the pattern will be left unchanged.)
<DT><B>BANG_HIST</B> (<B>+K</B>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Perform textual history expansion, <B>csh</B>-style,
treating the character `<B>!</B>' specially.
<DT><B>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</B> &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
In a glob pattern, treat a trailing set of parentheses as a qualifier
list, if it contains no `<B>|</B>', `<B>(</B>' or (if special) `<B>~</B>'
characters.  See the section `Filename Generation'.
<DT><B>BASH_AUTO_LIST</B><DD>
On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when the
completion function is called twice in succession.  This takes
precedence over <B>AUTO_LIST</B>.  The setting of <B>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</B> is
respected.  If <B>AUTO_MENU</B> is set, the menu behaviour will then start
with the third press.  Note that this will not work with
<B>MENU_COMPLETE</B>, since repeated completion calls immediately cycle
through the list in that case.
<DT><B>BEEP</B> (<B>+B</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Beep on error in ZLE.
<DT><B>BG_NICE</B> (<B>-6</B>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Run all background jobs at a lower priority.  This option
is set by default.
<DT><B>BRACE_CCL</B><DD>
Expand expressions in braces which would not otherwise undergo brace
expansion to a lexically ordered list of all the characters.  See
the section `Brace Expansion'.
<DT><B>BSD_ECHO</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Make the <B>echo</B> builtin compatible with the BSD <I><A HREF="../man1/echo.1.php">echo</A></I>(1) command.
This disables backslashed escape sequences in echo strings unless the
<B>-e</B> option is specified.
<DT><B>CASE_GLOB</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Make globbing (filename generation) sensitive to case.  Note that other
uses of patterns are always sensitive to case.  If the option is unset,
the presence of any character which is special to filename generation
will cause case-insensitive matching.  For example, <B>cvs(/)</B> can
match the directory <B>CVS</B> owing to the presence of the globbing flag
(unless the option <B>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</B> is unset).
<DT><B>C_BASES</B><DD>
Output hexadecimal numbers in the standard C format, for example `<B>0xFF</B>'
instead of the usual `<B>16#FF</B>'.  If the option <B>OCTAL_ZEROES</B> is also
set (it is not by default), octal numbers will be treated similarly and
hence appear as `<B>077</B>' instead of `<B>8#77</B>'.  This option has no effect
on the choice of the output base, nor on the output of bases other than
hexadecimal and octal.  Note that these formats will be understood on input
irrespective of the setting of <B>C_BASES</B>.
<DT><B>CDABLE_VARS</B> (<B>-T</B>)<DD>
If the argument to a <B>cd</B> command (or an implied <B>cd</B> with the
<B>AUTO_CD</B> option set) is not a directory, and does not begin with a
slash, try to expand the expression as if it were preceded by a `<B>~</B>' (see
the section `Filename Expansion').
<DT><B>CHASE_DOTS</B><DD>
When changing to a directory containing a path segment `<B>..</B>' which would
otherwise be treated as canceling the previous segment in the path (in
other words, `<B>foo/..</B>' would be removed from the path, or if `<B>..</B>' is
the first part of the path, the last part of <B>$PWD</B> would be deleted),
instead resolve the path to the physical directory.  This option is
overridden by <B>CHASE_LINKS</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example, suppose <B>/foo/bar</B> is a link to the directory <B>/alt/rod</B>.
Without this option set, `<B>cd /foo/bar/..</B>' changes to <B>/foo</B>; with it
set, it changes to <B>/alt</B>.  The same applies if the current directory
is <B>/foo/bar</B> and `<B>cd ..</B>' is used.  Note that all other symbolic
links in the path will also be resolved.
</DL>

<DT><B>CHASE_LINKS</B> (<B>-w</B>)<DD>
Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing directory.
This also has the effect of <B>CHASE_DOTS</B>, i.e. a `<B>..</B>' path segment
will be treated as referring to the physical parent, even if the preceding
path segment is a symbolic link.
<DT><B>CHECK_JOBS</B> &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Report the status of background and suspended jobs before exiting a shell
with job control; a second attempt to exit the shell will succeed.
<B>NO_CHECK_JOBS</B> is best used only in combination with <B>NO_HUP</B>, else
such jobs will be killed automatically.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The check is omitted if the commands run from the previous command line
included a `<B>jobs</B>' command, since it is assumed the user is aware that
there are background or suspended jobs.  A `<B>jobs</B>' command run from the
<B>precmd</B> function is not counted for this purpose.
</DL>

<DT><B>CLOBBER</B> (<B>+C</B>, ksh: <B>+C</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Allows `<B>&gt;</B>' redirection to truncate existing files,
and `<B>&gt;&gt;</B>' to create files.
Otherwise `<B>&gt;!</B>' or `<B>&gt;|</B>' must be used to truncate a file,
and `<B>&gt;&gt;!</B>' or `<B>&gt;&gt;|</B>' to create a file.
<DT><B>COMPLETE_ALIASES</B><DD>
Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally substituted
before completion is attempted.  The effect is to make the alias a
distinct command for completion purposes.
<DT><B>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</B><DD>
If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion is
started. Otherwise it stays there and completion is done from both ends.
<DT><B>CORRECT</B> (<B>-0</B>)<DD>
Try to correct the spelling of commands.
Note that, when the <B>HASH_LIST_ALL</B> option is not set or when some
directories in the path are not readable, this may falsely report spelling
errors the first time some commands are used.
<DT><B>CORRECT_ALL</B> (<B>-O</B>)<DD>
Try to correct the spelling of all arguments in a line.
<DT><B>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</B> &lt;C&gt;<DD>
A history reference without an event specifier will always refer to the
previous command.  Without this option, such a history reference refers
to the same event as the previous history reference, defaulting to the
previous command.
<DT><B>CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS</B> &lt;C&gt;<DD>
Allow loop bodies to take the form `<I>list</I>; <B>end</B>' instead of
`<B>do</B> <I>list</I>; <B>done</B>'.
<DT><B>CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES</B> &lt;C&gt;<DD>
Changes the rules for single- and double-quoted text to match that of
<B>csh</B>.  These require that embedded newlines be preceded by a backslash;
unescaped newlines will cause an error message.
In double-quoted strings, it is made impossible to escape `<B>$</B>', `<B>`</B>'
or `<B>&quot;</B>' (and `<B>\</B>' itself no longer needs escaping).
Command substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be nested.
<DT><B>CSH_NULLCMD</B> &lt;C&gt;<DD>
Do not use the values of <B>NULLCMD</B> and <B>READNULLCMD</B> 
when running redirections with no command.  This make 
such redirections fail (see the section `Redirection').
<DT><B>CSH_NULL_GLOB</B> &lt;C&gt;<DD>
If a pattern for filename generation has no matches,
delete the pattern from the argument list;
do not report an error unless all the patterns
in a command have no matches.
Overrides <B>NOMATCH</B>.
<DT><B>DVORAK</B><DD>
Use the Dvorak keyboard instead of the standard qwerty keyboard as a basis
for examining spelling mistakes for the <B>CORRECT</B> and <B>CORRECT_ALL</B>
options and the <B>spell-word</B> editor command.
<DT><B>EMACS</B><DD>
If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent effect
of `<B>bindkey -e</B>'.  In addition, the VI option is unset.
Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is
not guaranteed to reflect the current keymap.  This option is
provided for compatibility; <B>bindkey</B> is the recommended interface.
<DT><B>EQUALS</B> &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Perform <B>=</B> filename expansion.
(See the section `Filename Expansion'.)
<DT><B>ERR_EXIT</B> (<B>-e</B>, ksh: <B>-e</B>)<DD>
If a command has a non-zero exit status, execute the <B>ZERR</B>
trap, if set, and exit.  This is disabled while running initialization
scripts.
cidnex(return from function, on error)
<DT><B>ERR_RETURN</B><DD>
If a command has a non-zero exit status, return immediately from the
enclosing function.  The logic is identical to that for <B>ERR_EXIT</B>,
except that an implicit <B>return</B> statement is executed instead of an
<B>exit</B>.  This will trigger an exit at the outermost level of a
non-interactive script.
<DT><B>EXEC</B> (<B>+n</B>, ksh: <B>+n</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Do execute commands.  Without this option, commands are
read and checked for syntax errors, but not executed.
This option cannot be turned off in an interactive shell,
except when `<B>-n</B>' is supplied to the shell at startup.
<DT><B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B><DD>
Treat the `<B>#</B>', `<B>~</B>' and `<B>^</B>' characters as part of patterns
for filename generation, etc.  (An initial unquoted `<B>~</B>'
always produces named directory expansion.)
<DT><B>EXTENDED_HISTORY</B> &lt;C&gt;<DD>
Save each command's beginning timestamp (in seconds since the epoch)
and the duration (in seconds) to the history file.  The format of
this prefixed data is:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

`<B>:</B><I>&lt;beginning time&gt;</I><B>:</B><I>&lt;elapsed seconds&gt;</I><B>:</B><I>&lt;command&gt;</I>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>FLOW_CONTROL</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
If this option is unset,
output flow control via start/stop characters (usually assigned to
^S/^Q) is disabled in the shell's editor.
<DT><B>FUNCTION_ARGZERO</B> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
When executing a shell function or sourcing a script, set <B>$0</B>
temporarily to the name of the function/script.
<DT><B>GLOB</B> (<B>+F</B>, ksh: <B>+f</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Perform filename generation (globbing).
(See the section `Filename Generation'.)
<DT><B>GLOBAL_EXPORT</B> (<B>&lt;Z&gt;</B>)<DD>
If this option is set, passing the <B>-x</B> flag to the builtins <B>declare</B>,
<B>float</B>, <B>integer</B>, <B>readonly</B> and <B>typeset</B> (but not <B>local</B>)
will also set the <B>-g</B> flag;  hence parameters exported to
the environment will not be made local to the enclosing function, unless
they were already or the flag <B>+g</B> is given explicitly.  If the option is
unset, exported parameters will be made local in just the same way as any
other parameter.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option is set by default for backward compatibility; it is not
recommended that its behaviour be relied upon.  Note that the builtin
<B>export</B> always sets both the <B>-x</B> and <B>-g</B> flags, and hence its
effect extends beyond the scope of the enclosing function; this is the
most portable way to achieve this behaviour.
</DL>

<DT><B>GLOBAL_RCS</B> (<B>-d</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
If this option is unset, the startup files <B>/etc/zprofile</B>,
<B>/etc/zshrc</B>, <B>/etc/zlogin</B> and <B>/etc/zlogout</B> will not be run.  It
can be disabled and re-enabled at any time, including inside local startup
files (<B>.zshrc</B>, etc.).
<DT><B>GLOB_ASSIGN</B> &lt;C&gt;<DD>
If this option is set, filename generation (globbing) is
performed on the right hand side of scalar parameter assignments of
the form `<I>name</I><B>=</B><I>pattern</I> (e.g. `<B>foo=*</B>').
If the result has more than one word the parameter will become an array
with those words as arguments. This option is provided for backwards
compatibility only: globbing is always performed on the right hand side
of array assignments of the form `<I>name</I><B>=(</B><I>value</I><B>)</B>'
(e.g. `<B>foo=(*)</B>') and this form is recommended for clarity;
with this option set, it is not possible to predict whether the result
will be an array or a scalar.
<DT><B>GLOB_COMPLETE</B><DD>
When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words
resulting from the expansion but generate matches as for completion and
cycle through them like <B>MENU_COMPLETE</B>. The matches are generated as if
a `<B>*</B>' was added to the end of the word, or inserted at the cursor when
<B>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</B> is set.  This actually uses pattern matching, not
globbing, so it works not only for files but for any completion, such as
options, user names, etc.
<DT><B>GLOB_DOTS</B> (<B>-4</B>)<DD>
Do not require a leading `<B>.</B>' in a filename to be matched explicitly.
<DT><B>GLOB_SUBST</B> &lt;C&gt; &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Treat any characters resulting from parameter expansion as being
eligible for file expansion and filename generation, and any
characters resulting from command substitution as being eligible for
filename generation.  Braces (and commas in between) do not become eligible
for expansion.
<DT><B>HASH_CMDS</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Note the location of each command the first time it is executed.
Subsequent invocations of the same command will use the
saved location, avoiding a path search.
If this option is unset, no path hashing is done at all.
However, when <B>CORRECT</B> is set, commands whose names do not appear in
the functions or aliases hash tables are hashed in order to avoid
reporting them as spelling errors.
<DT><B>HASH_DIRS</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Whenever a command name is hashed, hash the directory containing it,
as well as all directories that occur earlier in the path.
Has no effect if neither <B>HASH_CMDS</B> nor <B>CORRECT</B> is set.
<DT><B>HASH_LIST_ALL</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Whenever a command completion is attempted, make sure the entire
command path is hashed first.  This makes the first completion slower.
<DT><B>HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER</B><DD>
Add `<B>|</B>' to output redirections in the history.  This allows history
references to clobber files even when <B>CLOBBER</B> is unset.
<DT><B>HIST_BEEP</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Beep when an attempt is made to access a history entry which
isn't there.
<DT><B>HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST</B><DD>
If the internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current command line,
setting this option will cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate
to be lost before losing a unique event from the list.
You should be sure to set the value of <B>HISTSIZE</B> to a larger number
than <B>SAVEHIST</B> in order to give you some room for the duplicated
events, otherwise this option will behave just like
<B>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</B> once the history fills up with unique events.
<DT><B>HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS</B><DD>
When searching for history entries in the line editor, do not display
duplicates of a line previously found, even if the duplicates are not
contiguous.
<DT><B>HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS</B><DD>
If a new command line being added to the history list duplicates an
older one, the older command is removed from the list (even if it is
not the previous event).
<DT><B>HIST_IGNORE_DUPS</B> (<B>-h</B>)<DD>
Do not enter command lines into the history list
if they are duplicates of the previous event.
<DT><B>HIST_IGNORE_SPACE</B> (<B>-g</B>)<DD>
Remove command lines from the history list when the first character on
the line is a space, or when one of the expanded aliases contains a
leading space.
Note that the command lingers in the internal history until the next
command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse
or edit the line.  If you want to make it vanish right away without
entering another command, type a space and press return.
<DT><B>HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS</B><DD>
Remove function definitions from the history list.
Note that the function lingers in the internal history until the next
command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse
or edit the definition.
<DT><B>HIST_NO_STORE</B><DD>
Remove the <B>history</B> (<B>fc -l</B>) command from the history list
when invoked.
Note that the command lingers in the internal history until the next
command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse
or edit the line.
<DT><B>HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS</B><DD>
Remove superfluous blanks from each command line
being added to the history list.
<DT><B>HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS</B><DD>
When writing out the history file, older commands that duplicate
newer ones are omitted.
<DT><B>HIST_VERIFY</B><DD>
Whenever the user enters a line with history expansion,
don't execute the line directly; instead, perform
history expansion and reload the line into the editing buffer.
<DT><B>HUP</B> &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Send the <B>HUP</B> signal to running jobs when the
shell exits.
<DT><B>IGNORE_BRACES</B> (<B>-I</B>) &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Do not perform brace expansion.
<DT><B>IGNORE_EOF</B> (<B>-7</B>)<DD>
Do not exit on end-of-file.  Require the use
of <B>exit</B> or <B>logout</B> instead.
However, ten consecutive EOFs will cause the shell to exit anyway,
to avoid the shell hanging if its tty goes away.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Also, if this option is set and the Zsh Line Editor is used, widgets
implemented by shell functions can be bound to EOF (normally
Control-D) without printing the normal warning message.  This works
only for normal widgets, not for completion widgets.
</DL>

<DT><B>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</B><DD>
This options works like <B>APPEND_HISTORY</B> except that new history lines
are added to the <B>$HISTFILE</B> incrementally (as soon as they are
entered), rather than waiting until the shell is killed.
The file is periodically trimmed to the number of lines specified by
<B>$SAVEHIST</B>, but can exceed this value between trimmings.
<DT><B>INTERACTIVE</B> (<B>-i</B>, ksh: <B>-i</B>)<DD>
This is an interactive shell.  This option is set upon initialisation if
the standard input is a tty and commands are being read from standard input.
(See the discussion of <B>SHIN_STDIN</B>.)
This heuristic may be overridden by specifying a state for this option
on the command line.
The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere other than the command line.
<DT><B>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</B> (<B>-k</B>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Allow comments even in interactive shells.
<DT><B>KSH_ARRAYS</B> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Emulate <B>ksh</B> array handling as closely as possible.  If this option
is set, array elements are numbered from zero, an array parameter
without subscript refers to the first element instead of the whole array,
and braces are required to delimit a subscript (`<B>${path[2]}</B>' rather
than just `<B>$path[2]</B>').
<DT><B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Emulate <B>ksh</B> function autoloading.  This means that when a function is
autoloaded, the corresponding file is merely executed, and must define
the function itself.  (By default, the function is defined to the contents
of the file.  However, the most common <B>ksh</B>-style case - of the file
containing only a simple definition of the function - is always handled
in the <B>ksh</B>-compatible manner.)
<DT><B>KSH_GLOB</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
In pattern matching, the interpretation of parentheses is affected by
a preceding `<B>@</B>', `<B>*</B>', `<B>+</B>', `<B>?</B>' or `<B>!</B>'.
See the section `Filename Generation'.
<DT><B>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
Alters the way options settings are printed: instead of separate lists of
set and unset options, all options are shown, marked `on' if
they are in the non-default state, `off' otherwise.
<DT><B>KSH_TYPESET</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
Alters the way arguments to the <B>typeset</B> family of commands, including
<B>declare</B>, <B>export</B>, <B>float</B>, <B>integer</B>, <B>local</B> and
<B>readonly</B>, are processed.  Without this option, zsh will perform normal
word splitting after command and parameter expansion in arguments of an
assignment; with it, word splitting does not take place in those cases.
<DT><B>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
This option works when <B>AUTO_LIST</B> or <B>BASH_AUTO_LIST</B> is also
set.  If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line,
that is done without a completion list being displayed; in other
words, auto-listing behaviour only takes place when nothing would be
inserted.  In the case of <B>BASH_AUTO_LIST</B>, this means that the list
will be delayed to the third call of the function.
<DT><B>LIST_BEEP</B> &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Beep on an ambiguous completion.  More accurately, this forces the
completion widgets to return status 1 on an ambiguous completion, which
causes the shell to beep if the option <B>BEEP</B> is also set; this may
be modified if completion is called from a user-defined widget.
<DT><B>LIST_PACKED</B><DD>
Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying less lines) by
printing the matches in columns with different widths.
<DT><B>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</B><DD>
Lay out the matches in completion lists sorted horizontally, that is,
the second match is to the right of the first one, not under it as
usual.
<DT><B>LIST_TYPES</B> (<B>-X</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
When listing files that are possible completions, show the
type of each file with a trailing identifying mark.
<DT><B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
If this option is set at the point of return from a shell function,
all the options (including this one) which were in force upon entry to
the function are restored.  Otherwise, only this option and the
<B>XTRACE</B> and <B>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</B> options are restored.  Hence
if this is explicitly unset by a shell function the other options in
force at the point of return will remain so.
A shell function can also guarantee itself a known shell configuration
with a formulation like `<B>emulate -L zsh</B>'; the <B>-L</B> activates
<B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B>.
<DT><B>LOCAL_TRAPS</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
If this option is set when a signal trap is set inside a function, then the
previous status of the trap for that signal will be restored when the
function exits.  Note that this option must be set <I>prior</I> to altering the
trap behaviour in a function; unlike <B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B>, the value on exit
from the function is irrelevant.  However, it does not need to be set
before any global trap for that to be correctly restored by a function.
For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>unsetopt localtraps
trap - INT
fn() { setopt localtraps; trap '' INT; sleep 3; }</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will restore normally handling of <B>SIGINT</B> after the function exits.
</DL>

<DT><B>LOGIN</B> (<B>-l</B>, ksh: <B>-l</B>)<DD>
This is a login shell.
If this option is not explicitly set, the shell is a login shell if
the first character of the <B>argv[0]</B> passed to the shell is a `<B>-</B>'.
<DT><B>LONG_LIST_JOBS</B> (<B>-R</B>)<DD>
List jobs in the long format by default.
<DT><B>MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST</B><DD>
All unquoted arguments of the form `<I>anything</I><B>=</B><I>expression</I>'
appearing after the command name have filename expansion (that is,
where <I>expression</I> has a leading `<B>~</B>' or `<B>=</B>') performed on
<I>expression</I> as if it were a parameter assignment.  The argument is
not otherwise treated specially; it is passed to the command as a single
argument, and not used as an actual parameter assignment.  For example, in
<B>echo foo=~/bar:~/rod</B>, both occurrences of <B>~</B> would be replaced.
Note that this happens anyway with <B>typeset</B> and similar statements.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option respects the setting of the <B>KSH_TYPESET</B> option.  In other
words, if both options are in effect, arguments looking like
assignments will not undergo wordsplitting.
</DL>

<DT><B>MAIL_WARNING</B> (<B>-U</B>)<DD>
Print a warning message if a mail file has been
accessed since the shell last checked.
<DT><B>MARK_DIRS</B> (<B>-8</B>, ksh: <B>-X</B>)<DD>
Append a trailing `<B>/</B>' to all directory
names resulting from filename generation (globbing).
<DT><B>MENU_COMPLETE</B> (<B>-Y</B>)<DD>
On an ambiguous completion, instead of listing possibilities or beeping,
insert the first match immediately.  Then when completion is requested
again, remove the first match and insert the second match, etc.
When there are no more matches, go back to the first one again.
<B>reverse-menu-complete</B> may be used to loop through the list
in the other direction. This option overrides <B>AUTO_MENU</B>.
<DT><B>MONITOR</B> (<B>-m</B>, ksh: <B>-m</B>)<DD>
Allow job control.  Set by default in interactive shells.
<DT><B>MULTIOS</B> &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Perform implicit <B>tee</B>s or <B>cat</B>s when multiple
redirections are attempted (see the section `Redirection').
<DT><B>NOMATCH</B> (<B>+3</B>) &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
If a pattern for filename generation has no matches,
print an error, instead of
leaving it unchanged in the argument list.
This also applies to file expansion
of an initial `<B>~</B>' or `<B>=</B>'.
<DT><B>NOTIFY</B> (<B>-5</B>, ksh: <B>-b</B>) &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Report the status of background jobs immediately, rather than
waiting until just before printing a prompt.
<DT><B>NULL_GLOB</B> (<B>-G</B>)<DD>
If a pattern for filename generation has no matches,
delete the pattern from the argument list instead
of reporting an error.  Overrides <B>NOMATCH</B>.
<DT><B>NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT</B><DD>
If numeric filenames are matched by a filename generation pattern,
sort the filenames numerically rather than lexicographically.
<DT><B>OCTAL_ZEROES</B> &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Interpret any integer constant beginning with a 0 as octal, per IEEE Std
1003.2-1992 (ISO 9945-2:1993).  This is not enabled by default as it
causes problems with parsing of, for example, date and time strings with
leading zeroes.
<DT><B>OVERSTRIKE</B><DD>
Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.
<DT><B>PATH_DIRS</B> (<B>-Q</B>)<DD>
Perform a path search even on command names with slashes in them.
Thus if `<B>/usr/local/bin</B>' is in the user's path, and he or she types
`<B>X11/xinit</B>', the command `<B>/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit</B>' will be executed
(assuming it exists).
Commands explicitly beginning with `<B>/</B>', `<B>./</B>' or `<B>../</B>'
are not subject to the path search.
This also applies to the <B>.</B> builtin.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that subdirectories of the current directory are always searched for
executables specified in this form.  This takes place before any search
indicated by this option, and regardless of whether `<B>.</B>' or the current
directory appear in the command search path.
</DL>

<DT><B>POSIX_BUILTINS</B> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
When this option is set the <B>command</B> builtin can be used to execute
shell builtin commands.  Parameter assignments specified before shell
functions and special builtins are kept after the command completes unless
the special builtin is prefixed with the <B>command</B> builtin.  Special
builtins are
<B>.</B>,
<B>:</B>,
<B>break</B>,
<B>continue</B>,
<B>declare</B>,
<B>eval</B>,
<B>exit</B>,
<B>export</B>,
<B>integer</B>,
<B>local</B>,
<B>readonly</B>,
<B>return</B>,
<B>set</B>,
<B>shift</B>,
<B>source</B>,
<B>times</B>,
<B>trap</B> and
<B>unset</B>.
<DT><B>PRINT_EIGHT_BIT</B><DD>
Print eight bit characters literally in completion lists, etc.
This option is not necessary if your system correctly returns the
printability of eight bit characters (see <I><A HREF="../man3/ctype.3.php">ctype</A></I>(3)).
<DT><B>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</B> (<B>-1</B>)<DD>
Print the exit value of programs with non-zero exit status.
<DT><B>PRIVILEGED</B> (<B>-p</B>, ksh: <B>-p</B>)<DD>
Turn on privileged mode. This is enabled automatically on startup if the
effective user (group) ID is not equal to the real user (group) ID.  Turning
this option off causes the effective user and group IDs to be set to the
real user and group IDs. This option disables sourcing user startup files.
If zsh is invoked as `<B>sh</B>' or `<B>ksh</B>' with this option set,
<B>/etc/suid_profile</B> is sourced (after <B>/etc/profile</B> on interactive
shells). Sourcing <B>~/.profile</B> is disabled and the contents of the
<B>ENV</B> variable is ignored. This option cannot be changed using the
<B>-m</B> option of <B>setopt</B> and <B>unsetopt</B>, and changing it inside a
function always changes it globally regardless of the <B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B>
option.
<DT><B>PROMPT_BANG</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
If set, `<B>!</B>' is treated specially in prompt expansion.
See the section `Prompt Expansion'.
<DT><B>PROMPT_CR</B> (<B>+V</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
Print a carriage return just before printing
a prompt in the line editor.  This is on by default as multi-line editing
is only possible if the editor knows where the start of the line appears.
<DT><B>PROMPT_PERCENT</B> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
If set, `<B>%</B>' is treated specially in prompt expansion.
See the section `Prompt Expansion'.
<DT><B>PROMPT_SUBST</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
If set, <I>parameter expansion</I>, <I>command substitution</I> and
<I>arithmetic expansion</I> are performed in prompts.
<DT><B>PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS</B><DD>
Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the directory stack.
<DT><B>PUSHD_MINUS</B><DD>
Exchanges the meanings of `<B>+</B>' and `<B>-</B>'
when used with a number to specify a directory in the stack.
<DT><B>PUSHD_SILENT</B> (<B>-E</B>)<DD>
Do not print the directory stack after <B>pushd</B> or <B>popd</B>.
<DT><B>PUSHD_TO_HOME</B> (<B>-D</B>)<DD>
Have <B>pushd</B> with no arguments act like `<B>pushd $HOME</B>'.
<DT><B>RC_EXPAND_PARAM</B> (<B>-P</B>)<DD>
Array expansions of the form
`<I>foo</I><B>${</B><I>xx</I><B>}</B><I>bar</I>', where the parameter
<I>xx</I> is set to <B>(</B><I>a b c</I><B>)</B>, are substituted with
`<I>fooabar foobbar foocbar</I>' instead of the default
`<I>fooa b cbar</I>'.
<DT><B>RC_QUOTES</B><DD>
Allow the character sequence `<B>''</B>' to signify a single quote
within singly quoted strings.  Note this does not apply in quoted strings
using the format <B>$'</B><I>...</I><B>'</B>, where a backslashed single quote can
be used.
<DT><B>RCS</B> (<B>+f</B>) &lt;D&gt;<DD>
After <B>/etc/zshenv</B> is sourced on startup, source the
<B>.zshenv</B>, <B>/etc/zprofile</B>, <B>.zprofile</B>,
<B>/etc/zshrc</B>, <B>.zshrc</B>, <B>/etc/zlogin</B>, <B>.zlogin</B>, and <B>.zlogout</B>
files, as described in the section `Files'.
If this option is unset, the <B>/etc/zshenv</B> file is still sourced, but any
of the others will not be; it can be set at any time to prevent the
remaining startup files after the currently executing one from
being sourced.
<DT><B>REC_EXACT</B> (<B>-S</B>)<DD>
In completion, recognize exact matches even
if they are ambiguous.
<DT><B>RESTRICTED</B> (<B>-r</B>)<DD>
Enables restricted mode.  This option cannot be changed using
<B>unsetopt</B>, and setting it inside a function always changes it
globally regardless of the <B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B> option.  See
the section `Restricted Shell'.
<DT><B>RM_STAR_SILENT</B> (<B>-H</B>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Do not query the user before executing `<B>rm *</B>' or `<B>rm path/*</B>'.
<DT><B>RM_STAR_WAIT</B><DD>
If querying the user before executing `<B>rm *</B>' or `<B>rm path/*</B>',
first wait ten seconds and ignore anything typed in that time.
This avoids the problem of reflexively answering `yes' to the query
when one didn't really mean it.  The wait and query can always be
avoided by expanding the `<B>*</B>' in ZLE (with tab).
<DT><B>SHARE_HISTORY</B> &lt;K&gt;<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option both imports new commands from the history file, and also
causes your typed commands to be appended to the history file (the
latter is like specifying <B>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</B>).
The history lines are also output with timestamps ala
<B>EXTENDED_HISTORY</B> (which makes it easier to find the spot where
we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).
<P>

By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as
well as the local lines, but you can toggle this on and off with the
set-local-history zle binding.  It is also possible to create a zle
widget that will make some commands ignore imported commands, and
some include them.
<P>

If you find that you want more control over when commands
get imported, you may wish to turn <B>SHARE_HISTORY</B> off,
<B>INC_APPEND_HISTORY</B> on, and then manually import
commands whenever you need them using `<B>fc -RI</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</B> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Perform filename expansion (e.g., ~ expansion) <I>before</I>
parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion
and brace expansion.
If this option is unset, it is performed <I>after</I>
brace expansion, so things like `<B>~$USERNAME</B>' and
`<B>~{pfalstad,rc}</B>' will work.
<DT><B>SH_GLOB</B> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Disables the special meaning of `<B>(</B>', `<B>|</B>', `<B>)</B>'
and '<B>&lt;</B>' for globbing the result of parameter and command substitutions,
and in some other places where
the shell accepts patterns.  This option is set by default if zsh is
invoked as <B>sh</B> or <B>ksh</B>.
<DT><B>SHIN_STDIN</B> (<B>-s</B>, ksh: <B>-s</B>)<DD>
Commands are being read from the standard input.
Commands are read from standard input if no command is specified with
<B>-c</B> and no file of commands is specified.  If <B>SHIN_STDIN</B>
is set explicitly on the command line,
any argument that would otherwise have been
taken as a file to run will instead be treated as a normal positional
parameter.
Note that setting or unsetting this option on the command line does not
necessarily affect the state the option will have while the shell is
running - that is purely an indicator of whether on not commands are
<I>actually</I> being read from standard input.
The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere other 
than the command line.
<DT><B>SH_NULLCMD</B> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Do not use the values of <B>NULLCMD</B> and <B>READNULLCMD</B> 
when doing redirections, use `<B>:</B>' instead (see the section `Redirection').
<DT><B>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</B> &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
If this option is set the shell tries to interpret single letter options
(which are used with <B>set</B> and <B>setopt</B>) like <B>ksh</B> does.
This also affects the value of the <B>-</B> special parameter.
<DT><B>SHORT_LOOPS</B> &lt;C&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Allow the short forms of <B>for</B>, <B>repeat</B>, <B>select</B>,
<B>if</B>, and <B>function</B> constructs.
<DT><B>SH_WORD_SPLIT</B> (<B>-y</B>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt;<DD>
Causes field splitting to be performed on unquoted parameter expansions.
Note that this option has nothing to do with word splitting.
(See the section `Parameter Expansion'.)
<DT><B>SINGLE_COMMAND</B> (<B>-t</B>, ksh: <B>-t</B>)<DD>
If the shell is reading from standard input, it exits after a single command
has been executed.  This also makes the shell non-interactive, unless the
<B>INTERACTIVE</B> option is explicitly set on the command line.
The value of this option cannot be changed anywhere other than the command line.
<DT><B>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</B> (<B>-M</B>) &lt;K&gt;<DD>
Use single-line command line editing instead of multi-line.
<DT><B>SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK</B> (<B>-L</B>)<DD>
If a line ends with a backquote, and there are an odd number
of backquotes on the line, ignore the trailing backquote.
This is useful on some keyboards where the return key is
too small, and the backquote key lies annoyingly close to it.
<DT><B>TRANSIENT_RPROMPT</B><DD>
Remove any right prompt from display when accepting a command
line.  This may be useful with terminals with other cut/paste methods.
<DT><B>TYPESET_SILENT</B><DD>
If this is unset, executing any of the `<B>typeset</B>' family of
commands with no options and a list of parameters that have no values
to be assigned but already exist will display the value of the parameter.
If the option is set, they will only be shown when parameters are selected
with the `<B>-m</B>' option.  The option `<B>-p</B>' is available whether or not
the option is set.
<DT><B>UNSET</B> (<B>+u</B>, ksh: <B>+u</B>) &lt;K&gt; &lt;S&gt; &lt;Z&gt;<DD>
Treat unset parameters as if they were empty when substituting.
Otherwise they are treated as an error.
<DT><B>VERBOSE</B> (<B>-v</B>, ksh: <B>-v</B>)<DD>
Print shell input lines as they are read.
<DT><B>VI</B><DD>
If ZLE is loaded, turning on this option has the equivalent effect
of `<B>bindkey -v</B>'.  In addition, the EMACS option is unset.
Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is
not guaranteed to reflect the current keymap.  This option is
provided for compatibility; <B>bindkey</B> is the recommended interface.
<DT><B>XTRACE</B> (<B>-x</B>, ksh: <B>-x</B>)<DD>
Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
<DT><B>ZLE</B> (<B>-Z</B>)<DD>
Use the zsh line editor.  Set by default in interactive shells connected to
a terminal.

<H2>SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</H2>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-</B> <I>simple command</I>
See the section `Precommand Modifiers'.
<DT><B>.</B> <I>file</I> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]<DD>
Read commands from <I>file</I> and execute them in the current shell
environment.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <I>file</I> does not contain a slash, or if <B>PATH_DIRS</B> is set,
the shell looks in the components of <B>$path</B> to find the directory
containing <I>file</I>.  Files in the current directory are not read
unless `<B>.</B>' appears somewhere in <B>$path</B>.  If a file named
`<I>file</I><B>.zwc</B>' is found, is newer than <I>file</I>, and is the
compiled form (created with the <B>zcompile</B> builtin) of <I>file</I>,
then commands are read from that file instead of <I>file</I>.
<P>

If any arguments <I>arg</I> are given,
they become the positional parameters; the old positional
parameters are restored when the <I>file</I> is done executing.
The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed.
</DL>

<DT><B>:</B> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]<DD>
This command does nothing, although normal argument expansions is performed
which may have effects on shell parameters.  A zero exit code is returned.
<DT><B>alias</B> [ {<B>+|-</B>}<B>gmrsL</B> ] [ <I>name</I>[<B>=</B><I>value</I>] ... ]<DD>
For each <I>name</I> with a corresponding <I>value</I>, define an alias
with that value.  A trailing space in <I>value</I> causes the next word
to be checked for alias expansion.  If the <B>-g</B> flag is present,
define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not
occur in command position.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the <B>-s</B> flags is present, define a suffix alias: if the command
word on a command line is in the form `<I>text</I><B>.</B><I>name</I>', where
<I>text</I> is any non-empty string, it is replaced by the text
`<I>value</I> <I>text</I><B>.</B><I>name</I>'.  Note that <I>name</I> is treated as
a literal string, not a pattern.  A trailing space in <I>value</I> is not
special in this case.  For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>alias -s ps=gv</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will cause the command `<B>*.ps</B>' to be expanded to `<B>gv *.ps</B>'.  As
alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `<B>*.ps</B>' will
then be expanded.  Suffix aliases constitute a different name space from
other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible
to create an alias for the command <B>ps</B>) and the two sets are never
listed together.
<P>

For each <I>name</I> with no <I>value</I>,
print the value of <I>name</I>, if any.  With no arguments, print all
currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases.  If the <B>-m</B> flag
is given the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to
preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases
matching these patterns are printed.  When printing aliases and one of
the <B>-g</B>, <B>-r</B> or <B>-s</B> flags is present, restrict the printing to
global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one
which is neither a global nor a suffix alias.   Using `<B>+</B>'
instead of `<B>-</B>', or ending the option list with a single
`<B>+</B>', prevents the values of the aliases from being printed.
<P>

If the <B>-L</B> flag is present, then print each
alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup script.  The exit
status is nonzero if a <I>name</I> (with no <I>value</I>) is given for
which no alias has been defined.
</DL>

<DT><B>autoload</B> [ {<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>}<B>UXmt</B> ] [ <B>-wkz</B> ] [ <I>name</I> ... ]<DD>
Equivalent to <B>functions -u</B>, with the exception of <B>-X</B>/<B>+X</B>,
<B>-w</B>, <B>-k</B> and <B>-z</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The flag <B>-X</B> may be used only inside a shell function, and may not be
followed by a <I>name</I>.  It causes the calling function to be marked for
autoloading and then immediately loaded and executed, with the current
array of positional parameters as arguments.  This replaces the previous
definition of the function.  If no function definition is found, an error
is printed and the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading.
<P>

The flag <B>+X</B> attempts to load each <I>name</I> as an autoloaded function,
but does <I>not</I> execute it.  The exit status is zero (success) if the
function was not previously defined <I>and</I> a definition for it was found.
This does <I>not</I> replace any existing definition of the function.  The
exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or
when no definition was found.  In the latter case the function remains
undefined and marked for autoloading.
<P>

The flag <B>+X</B> may be combined with either <B>-k</B> or <B>-z</B> to make
the function be loaded using ksh-style or zsh-style autoloading,
respectively. If neither is given, the current setting of the
<B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> options determines how the function is loaded. With
ksh-style autoloading, the contents of the file will not be executed
immediately. Instead, the function created will contain the contents of 
the file plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus given 
normal ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function.
<P>

With the <B>-w</B> flag, the <I>name</I>s are taken as names of files compiled
with the <B>zcompile</B> builtin, and all functions defined in them are
marked for autoloading.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>bg</B> [ <I>job</I> ... ]
<DT>
<DD>
<I>job</I> ... <B>&amp;</B>
Put each specified <I>job</I> in the background,

<DT><B>bindkey</B><DD>
See the section `Zle Builtins' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1).
<DT><B>break</B> [ <I>n</I> ]<DD>
Exit from an enclosing <B>for</B>, <B>while</B>,
<B>until</B>, <B>select</B> or <B>repeat</B> loop.  If <I>n</I>
is specified, then break <I>n</I> levels instead of just one.
<DT><B>builtin</B> <I>name</I> [ <I>args</I> ... ]<DD>
Executes the builtin <I>name</I>, with the given <I>args</I>.
<DT><B>bye</B><DD>
Same as <B>exit</B>.
<DT><B>cap</B><DD>
See the section `The zsh/cap Module' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).

<DT>
<DD>
<B>cd</B> [ <B>-sLP</B> ] {<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>}<I>n</I>
Change the current directory.  In the first form, change the
current directory to <I>arg</I>, or to the value of <B>$HOME</B> if
<I>arg</I> is not specified.  If <I>arg</I> is `<B>-</B>', change to the
value of <B>$OLDPWD</B>, the previous directory.
Otherwise, if a directory named <I>arg</I> is not found in the current
directory and <I>arg</I> does not begin with a slash, search each
component of the shell parameter <B>cdpath</B>.  If no directory is found
and the option <B>CDABLE_VARS</B> is set, and a parameter named <I>arg</I>
exists whose value begins with a slash, treat its value as the
directory.  In that case, the parameter is added to the named
directory hash table.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The second form of <B>cd</B> substitutes the string <I>new</I>
for the string <I>old</I> in the name of the current directory,
and tries to change to this new directory.
<P>

The third form of <B>cd</B> extracts an entry from the directory
stack, and changes to that directory.  An argument of the form
`<B>+</B><I>n</I>' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left
of the list shown by the <B>dirs</B> command, starting with zero.
An argument of the form `<B>-</B><I>n</I>' counts from the right.
If the <B>PUSHD_MINUS</B> option is set, the meanings of `<B>+</B>'
and `<B>-</B>' in this context are swapped.
<P>

If the <B>-s</B> option is specified, <B>cd</B> refuses to change the current
directory if the given pathname contains symlinks.  If the <B>-P</B> option
is given or the <B>CHASE_LINKS</B> option is set, symbolic links are resolved
to their true values.  If the <B>-L</B> option is given symbolic links are
followed regardless of the state of the <B>CHASE_LINKS</B> option.
</DL>

<DT><B>chdir</B><DD>
Same as <B>cd</B>.
<DT><B>clone</B><DD>
See the section `The zsh/clone Module' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).
<DT><B>command</B> [ <B>-pvV</B> ] <I>simple command</I><DD>
The simple command argument is taken as an external command instead of
a function or builtin and is executed. If the <B>POSIX_BUILTINS</B> option
is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties
of them are suppressed. The <B>-p</B> flag causes a default path to be
searched instead of that in <B>$path</B>. With the <B>-v</B> flag, <B>command</B>
is similar to <B>whence</B> and with <B>-V</B>, it is equivalent to <B>whence
-v</B>.

<DT><B>disable</B> [ <B>-afmrs</B> ] <I>name</I> ...<DD>
Temporarily disable the <I>name</I>d hash table elements.  The default
is to disable builtin commands.  This allows you to use an external
command with the same name as a builtin command.  The <B>-a</B> option
causes <B>disable</B> to act on regular or global aliases.  The <B>-s</B>
option causes <B>disable</B> to act on suffix aliases.  The <B>-f</B> option causes
<B>disable</B> to act on shell functions.  The <B>-r</B> options causes
<B>disable</B> to act on reserved words.  Without arguments all disabled
hash table elements from the corresponding hash table are printed.
With the <B>-m</B> flag the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be
quoted to prevent them from undergoing filename expansion), and all hash
table elements from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns
are disabled.  Disabled objects can be enabled with the <B>enable</B>

Remove the specified <I>job</I>s from the job table; the shell will
no longer report their status, and will not complain if you
try to exit an interactive shell with them running or stopped.
If no <I>job</I> is specified, disown the current job.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the <I>job</I>s are currently stopped and the <B>AUTO_CONTINUE</B> option
is not set, a warning is printed containing information about how to

<DT><B>emulate</B> [ <B>-LR</B> ] {<B>zsh</B>|<B>sh</B>|<B>ksh</B>|<B>csh</B>}<DD>
Set up zsh options to emulate the specified shell as much as possible.
<B>csh</B> will never be fully emulated.
If the argument is not one of the shells listed above, <B>zsh</B>
will be used as a default; more precisely, the tests performed on the
argument are the same as those used to determine the emulation at startup
based on the shell name, see
the section `Compatibility' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1)
.  If the <B>-R</B> option is given, all options
are reset to their default value corresponding to the specified emulation
mode, except for certain options describing the interactive
environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause portability
problems in scripts and functions are altered.  If the <B>-L</B> option
is given, the options <B>LOCAL_OPTIONS</B> and <B>LOCAL_TRAPS</B> will be set as
well, causing the effects of the <B>emulate</B> command and any <B>setopt</B> and
<B>trap</B> commands to be local to the immediately surrounding shell
function, if any; normally these options are turned off in all emulation
modes except <B>ksh</B>.
<DT><B>enable</B> [ <B>-afmrs</B> ] <I>name</I> ...<DD>
Enable the <I>name</I>d hash table elements, presumably disabled
earlier with <B>disable</B>.  The default is to enable builtin commands.
The <B>-a</B> option causes <B>enable</B> to act on regular or global aliases.
The <B>-s</B> option causes <B>enable</B> to act on suffix aliases.
The <B>-f</B> option causes <B>enable</B> to act on shell functions.  The <B>-r</B>
option causes <B>enable</B> to act on reserved words.  Without arguments
all enabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash table are
printed.  With the <B>-m</B> flag the arguments are taken as patterns
(should be quoted) and all hash table elements from the corresponding
hash table matching these patterns are enabled.  Enabled objects can be
disabled with the <B>disable</B> builtin command.
<DT><B>eval</B> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]<DD>
Read the arguments as input to the shell and execute the resulting
command in the current shell process.
<DT><B>exec</B> <I>simple command</I><DD>
See the section `Precommand Modifiers'.
<DT><B>exit</B> [ <I>n</I> ]<DD>
Exit the shell with the exit code specified by <I>n</I>; if none
is specified, use the exit code from the last command executed.
An EOF condition will also cause the shell to exit, unless
the <B>IGNORE_EOF</B> option is set.
<DT><B>export</B> [ <I>name</I>[<B>=</B><I>value</I>] ... ]<DD>
The specified <I>name</I>s are marked for automatic export

Equivalent to <B>typeset -gx</B>.
If a parameter specified does not
already exist, it is created in the global scope.
<DT><B>false</B> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]<DD>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>fc</B> <B>-ARWI</B> [ <I>filename</I> ]
Select a range of commands from <I>first</I> to <I>last</I> from the
history list.
The arguments <I>first</I> and <I>last</I> may be specified as a
number or as a string.  A negative number is used as an offset
to the current history event number.
A string specifies the most recent event beginning with the given string.
All substitutions <I>old</I><B>=</B><I>new</I>, if any, are then performed
on the commands.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the <B>-l</B> flag is given, the resulting commands are listed on
standard output.
If the <B>-m</B> flag is also given the first argument is taken as a
pattern (should be quoted) and only the history events matching this
pattern will be shown.
Otherwise the editor program <I>ename</I> is invoked on a file containing
these history events.  If <I>ename</I> is not given, the value
of the parameter <B>FCEDIT</B> is used.  If <I>ename</I> is `<B>-</B>',
no editor is invoked.  When editing is complete, the edited
command is executed.
<P>

If <I>first</I> is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent
event), or to -16 if the <B>-l</B> flag is given.
If <I>last</I> is not specified, it will be set to <I>first</I>,
or to -1 if the <B>-l</B> flag is given.
<P>

The flag <B>-r</B> reverses the order of the commands and the
flag <B>-n</B> suppresses command numbers when listing.
Also when listing, <B>-d</B> prints timestamps for each command, and
<B>-f</B> prints full time-date stamps.  Adding the <B>-E</B> flag
causes the dates to be printed as `<I>dd</I><B>.</B><I>mm</I><B>.</B><I>yyyy</I>',
instead of the default `<I>mm</I><B>/</B><I>dd</I><B>/</B><I>yyyy</I>'.
Adding the <B>-i</B> flag causes the dates to be printed in ISO8601
`<I>yyyy</I><B>-</B><I>mm</I><B>-</B><I>dd</I>' format.
With the <B>-D</B> flag, <B>fc</B> prints elapsed times.
<P>

`<B>fc -R</B>' reads the history from the given file,
`<B>fc -W</B>' writes the history out to the given file,
and `<B>fc -A</B>' appends the history out to the given file.
If no filename is specified, the <B>$HISTFILE</B> is assumed.
If the <B>-I</B> option is added to <B>-R</B>, only those events that are
not already contained within the internal history list are added.
If the <B>-I</B> option is added to <B>-A</B> or <B>-W</B>, only those
events that are new since last incremental append/write to
the history file are appended/written.
In any case, the created file will have no more than <B>$SAVEHIST</B>
entries.

<DT><B>getopts</B> <I>optstring</I> <I>name</I> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]<DD>
Checks the <I>arg</I>s for legal options.  If the <I>arg</I>s are omitted,
use the positional parameters.  A valid option argument
begins with a `<B>+</B>' or a `<B>-</B>'.  An argument not beginning with
a `<B>+</B>' or a `<B>-</B>', or the argument `<B>--</B>', ends the options.
Note that a single `<B>-</B>' is not considered a valid option argument.
<I>optstring</I> contains the letters that <B>getopts</B>
recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a `<B>:</B>', that option
is expected to have an argument.  The options can be
separated from the argument by blanks.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Each time it is invoked, <B>getopts</B> places the option letter it finds
in the shell parameter <I>name</I>, prepended with a `<B>+</B>' when
<I>arg</I> begins with a `<B>+</B>'.  The index of the next <I>arg</I>
is stored in <B>OPTIND</B>.  The option argument, if any,
is stored in <B>OPTARG</B>.
<P>

The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly assigning
to <B>OPTIND</B>.  <B>OPTIND</B> has an initial value of <B>1</B>, and is
normally reset to <B>1</B> upon exit from a shell function.  <B>OPTARG</B>
is not reset and retains its value from the most recent call to
<B>getopts</B>.  If either of <B>OPTIND</B> or <B>OPTARG</B> is explicitly
unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not
stored.  The option itself is still stored in <I>name</I> in this case.
<P>

A leading `<B>:</B>' in <I>optstring</I> causes <B>getopts</B> to store the
letter of any invalid option in <B>OPTARG</B>, and to set <I>name</I> to
`<B>?</B>' for an unknown option and to `<B>:</B>' when a required option is
missing.  Otherwise, <B>getopts</B> sets <I>name</I> to `<B>?</B>' and prints
an error message when an option is invalid.  The exit status is
nonzero when there are no more options.
</DL>

<DT><B>hash</B> [ <B>-Ldfmrv</B> ] [ <I>name</I>[<B>=</B><I>value</I>] ] ...<DD>
<B>hash</B> can be used to directly modify the contents of the command
hash table, and the named directory hash table.  Normally one would
modify these tables by modifying one's <B>PATH</B>
(for the command hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters
(for the named directory hash table).
The choice of hash table to work on is determined by the <B>-d</B> option;
without the option the command hash table is used, and with the option the
named directory hash table is used.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Given no arguments, and neither the <B>-r</B> or <B>-f</B> options,
the selected hash table will be listed in full.
<P>

The <B>-r</B> option causes the selected hash table to be emptied.
It will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal fashion.
The <B>-f</B> option causes the selected hash table to be fully
rebuilt immediately.  For the command hash table this hashes
all the absolute directories in the <B>PATH</B>,
and for the named directory hash table this adds all users' home directories.
These two options cannot be used with any arguments.
<P>

The <B>-m</B> option causes the arguments to be taken as patterns
(which should be quoted) and the elements of the hash table
matching those patterns are printed.  This is the only way to display
a limited selection of hash table elements.
<P>

For each <I>name</I> with a corresponding <I>value</I>, put `<I>name</I>' in
the selected hash table, associating it with the pathname `<I>value</I>'.
In the command hash table, this means that
whenever `<I>name</I>' is used as a command argument, the shell will try
to execute the file given by `<I>value</I>'.
In the named directory hash table, this means
that `<I>value</I>' may be referred to as `<B>~</B><I>name</I>'.
<P>

For each <I>name</I> with no
corresponding <I>value</I>, attempt to add <I>name</I> to the hash table,
checking what the appropriate <B>value</B> is in the normal manner for
that hash table.  If an appropriate <B>value</B> can't be found, then
the hash table will be unchanged.
<P>

The <B>-v</B> option causes hash table entries to be listed as they are
added by explicit specification.  If has no effect if used with <B>-f</B>.
<P>

If the <B>-L</B> flag is present, then each hash table entry is printed in
the form of a call to hash.

Print the arguments in columns.  Unless <B>-a</B> is also given, arguments are
printed with the row incrementing first.
<DT><B>-C</B> <I>cols</I><DD>
Print the arguments in <I>cols</I> columns.  Unless <B>-a</B> is also given,
arguments are printed with the row incrementing first.
<DT><B>-D</B><DD>
Treat the arguments as directory names, replacing prefixes with <B>~</B>
expressions, as appropriate.
<DT><B>-i</B><DD>
If given together with <B>-o</B> or <B>-O</B>, sorting is performed
case-independently.
<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
Print the arguments separated by newlines instead of spaces.
<DT><B>-m</B><DD>
Take the first argument as a pattern (should be quoted), and remove
it from the argument list together with subsequent arguments that
do not match this pattern.
<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
Do not add a newline to the output.
<DT><B>-N</B><DD>
Print the arguments separated and terminated by nulls.
<DT><B>-o</B><DD>
Print the arguments sorted in ascending order.
<DT><B>-O</B><DD>
Print the arguments sorted in descending order.
<DT><B>-p</B><DD>
Print the arguments to the input of the coprocess.
<DT><B>-P</B><DD>
Perform prompt expansion (see

<DT><B>-r</B><DD>
Ignore the escape conventions of <B>echo</B>.
<DT><B>-R</B><DD>
Emulate the BSD <B>echo</B> command, which does not process escape sequences
unless the <B>-e</B> flag is given.  The <B>-n</B> flag suppresses the trailing
newline.  Only the <B>-e</B> and <B>-n</B> flags are recognized after
<B>-R</B>; all other arguments and options are printed.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
Place the results in the history list instead of on the standard output.
<DT><B>-u</B> <I>n</I><DD>
Print the arguments to file descriptor <I>n</I>.
<DT><B>-z</B><DD>
Push the arguments onto the editing buffer stack, separated by spaces.
</DL>
<P>

If any of `<B>-m</B>', `<B>-o</B>' or `<B>-O</B>' are used in combination with
`<B>-f</B>' and there are no arguments (after the removal process in the
case of `<B>-m</B>') then nothing is printed.
</DL>

<DT><B>printf</B> <I>format</I> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]<DD>
Print the arguments according to the format specification. Formatting
rules are the same as used in C. The same escape sequences as for <B>echo</B>
are recognised in the format. All C conversion specifications ending in
one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are handled. In addition to this, `<B>%b</B>' can be
used instead of `<B>%s</B>' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be
recognised and `<B>%q</B>' can be used to quote the argument in such a way
that allows it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format
specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character,
the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to
print otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See
the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' for a description of arithmetic
expressions. With `<B>%n</B>', the corresponding argument is taken as an
identifier which is created as an integer parameter.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order
but they can explicitly specify the <I>n</I>th argument is to be used by
replacing `<B>%</B>' by `<B>%</B><I>n</I><B>$</B>' and `<B>*</B>' by `<B>*</B><I>n</I><B>$</B>'.
It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style
with the normal style and the handling of such mixed styles may be subject
to future change.
<P>

If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused
until all arguments have been consumed. With the <B>print</B> builtin, this
can be suppressed by using the <B>-r</B> option. If more arguments are
required by the format than have been specified, the behaviour is as if
zero or an empty string had been specified as the argument.

<B>pushd</B> [ <B>-sLP</B> ] {<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>}<I>n</I>
Change the current directory, and push the old current directory
onto the directory stack.  In the first form, change the
current directory to <I>arg</I>.
If <I>arg</I> is not specified, change to the second directory
on the stack (that is, exchange the top two entries), or
change to <B>$HOME</B> if the <B>PUSHD_TO_HOME</B>
option is set or if there is only one entry on the stack.
Otherwise, <I>arg</I> is interpreted as it would be by <B>cd</B>.
The meaning of <I>old</I> and <I>new</I> in the second form is also
the same as for <B>cd</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The third form of <B>pushd</B> changes directory by rotating the
directory list.  An argument of the form `<B>+</B><I>n</I>' identifies a stack
entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the <B>dirs</B>
command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form `<B>-</B><I>n</I>' counts
from the right.  If the <B>PUSHD_MINUS</B> option is set, the meanings
of `<B>+</B>' and `<B>-</B>' in this context are swapped.
<P>

If the option <B>PUSHD_SILENT</B> is not set, the directory
stack will be printed after a <B>pushd</B> is performed.
<P>

The options <B>-s</B>, <B>-L</B> and <B>-P</B> have the same meanings as for the

The first field is assigned to the first <I>name</I>, the second field
to the second <I>name</I>, etc., with leftover

Raw mode: a `<B>\</B>' at the end of a line does not signify line
continuation and backslashes in the line don't quote the following
character and are not removed.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
Don't echo back characters if reading from the terminal.  Currently does
not work with the <B>-q</B> option.
<DT><B>-q</B><DD>
Read only one character from the terminal and set <I>name</I> to
`<B>y</B>' if this character was `<B>y</B>' or `<B>Y</B>' and to `<B>n</B>' otherwise.
With this flag set the return value is zero only if the character was
`<B>y</B>' or `<B>Y</B>'.  Note that this always reads from the terminal, even
if used with the <B>-p</B> or <B>-u</B> or <B>-z</B> flags or with redirected input.
This option may also be used within zle widgets.
<DT><B>-k</B> [ <I>num</I> ]<DD>
Read only one (or <I>num</I>) characters.  All are assigned to the first
<I>name</I>, without word splitting.  This flag is ignored when <B>-q</B> is
present.  Input is read from the terminal unless one of <B>-u</B> or <B>-p</B>
is present.  This option may also be used within zle widgets.
<DT><B>-z</B><DD>
Read one entry from the editor buffer stack and assign it to the first
<I>name</I>, without word splitting.  Text is pushed onto the stack with
`<B>print -z</B>' or with <B>push-line</B> from the line editor (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1)).  This flag is ignored when the <B>-k</B> or <B>-q</B> flags are present.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-e</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-E</B>
The input read is printed (echoed) to the standard output.  If the <B>-e</B>
flag is used, no input is assigned to the parameters.
<DT><B>-A</B><DD>
The first <I>name</I> is taken as the name of an array and all words are
assigned to it.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-c</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-l</B>
These flags are allowed only if called inside a
function used for completion (specified with the <B>-K</B> flag to
<B>compctl</B>).  If the <B>-c</B> flag is given, the words of the
current command are read. If the <B>-l</B> flag is given, the whole
line is assigned as a scalar.  If both flags are present, <B>-l</B>
is used and <B>-c</B> is ignored.
<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
Together with <B>-c</B>, the number of the word the cursor is on is
read.  With <B>-l</B>, the index of the character the cursor is on is
read.  Note that the command name is word number 1, not word 0,
and that when the cursor is at the end of the line, its character
index is the length of the line plus one.
<DT><B>-u</B> <I>n</I><DD>
Input is read from file descriptor <I>n</I>.
<DT><B>-p</B><DD>
Input is read from the coprocess.
<DT><B>-d</B> <I>delim</I><DD>
Input is terminated by the first character of <I>delim</I> instead of
by newline.
<DT><B>-t</B> [ <I>num</I> ]<DD>
Test if input is available before attempting to read.  If <I>num</I>
is present, it must begin with a digit and will be evaluated
to give a number of seconds, which may be a floating point number;
in this case the read times out if input is not available within this
time.  If <I>num</I> is not present, it is taken to be zero, so that
<B>read</B> returns immediately if no input is available.
If no input is available, return status 1 and do not set any variables.
<BR>&nbsp;
This option is not available when reading from the editor buffer with
<B>-z</B>, when called from within completion with <B>-c</B> or <B>-l</B>, with
<B>-q</B> which clears the input queue before reading, or within zle where
other mechanisms should be used to test for input.
<BR>&nbsp;
Note that read does not attempt to alter the input processing mode.  The
default mode is canonical input, in which an entire line is read at a time,
so usually `<B>read -t</B>' will not read anything until an entire line has
been typed.  However, when reading from the terminal with <B>-k</B>
input is processed one key at a time; in this case, only availability of
the first character is tested, so that e.g. `<B>read -t -k 2</B>' can still
block on the second character.  Use two instances of `<B>read -t -k</B>' if
this is not what is wanted.
If the first argument contains a `<B>?</B>', the remainder of this
word is used as a <I>prompt</I> on standard error when the shell
is interactive.
</DL>
<P>

The value (exit status) of <B>read</B> is 1 when an end-of-file is
encountered, or when <B>-c</B> or <B>-l</B> is present and the command is
not called from a <B>compctl</B> function, or as described for <B>-q</B>.
Otherwise the value is 0.
<P>

The behavior of some combinations of the <B>-k</B>, <B>-p</B>, <B>-q</B>, <B>-u</B>
and <B>-z</B> flags is undefined.  Presently <B>-q</B> cancels all the others,
<B>-p</B> cancels <B>-u</B>, <B>-k</B> cancels <B>-z</B>, and otherwise <B>-z</B>
cancels both <B>-p</B> and <B>-u</B>.

executed.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <B>return</B> was executed from a trap in a <B>TRAP</B><I>NAL</I> function,
the effect is different for zero and non-zero return status.  With zero
status (or after an implicit return at the end of the trap), the shell
will return to whatever it was previously processing; with a non-zero
status, the shell will behave as interrupted except that the return
status of the trap is retained.  Note that the numeric value of the signal
which caused the trap is passed as the first argument, so the statement
`<B>return $((128+$1))</B>' will return the same status as if the signal
had not been trapped.

Set the options for the shell and/or set the positional parameters, or
declare and set an array.  If the <B>-s</B> option is given, it causes the
specified arguments to be sorted before assigning them to the positional
parameters (or to the array <I>name</I> if <B>-A</B> is used).  With <B>+s</B>
sort arguments in descending order.  For the meaning of the other flags, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshoptions.1.php">zshoptions</A></I>(1).  Flags may be specified by name using the <B>-o</B> option. If no option
name is supplied with <B>-o</B>, the current option states are printed.
With <B>+o</B> they are printed in a form that can be used as input
to the shell.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

If the <B>-A</B> flag is specified, <I>name</I> is set to an array containing

<P>

If <B>+A</B> is used and <I>name</I> is an array, the
given arguments will replace the initial elements of that array; if no
<I>name</I> is specified, all arrays are printed without their values.
<P>

The behaviour of arguments after <B>-A</B> <I>name</I> or <B>+A</B> <I>name</I>
depends on whether the option <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B> is set.  If it is not set, all
arguments following <I>name</I> are treated as values for the array,
regardless of their form.  If the option is set, normal option processing
continues at that point; only regular arguments are treated as values for
the array.  This means that
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>set -A array -x -- foo</B>

sets <B>array</B> to `<B>-x -- foo</B>' if <B>KSH_ARRAYS</B> is not set, but sets

<P>

If the <B>-A</B> flag is not present, but there are arguments beyond the
options, the positional parameters are set.  If the option list (if any)
is terminated by `<B>-</B><B>-</B>', and there are no further arguments, the
positional parameters will be unset.

If no arguments and no `<B>-</B><B>-</B>' are given, then the names and values of

Set the options for the shell.  All options specified either
with flags or by name are set.  If no arguments are supplied,
the names of all options currently set are printed.
If the <B>-m</B> flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns
(which should be quoted to protect them from filename expansion), and all

<DT><B>shift</B> [ <I>n</I> ] [ <I>name</I> ... ]<DD>
The positional parameters <B>${</B><I>n</I>+1<B>}</B> ... are renamed

receives <I>sig</I>.  Each <I>sig</I> can be given as a number
or as the name of a signal.
If <I>arg</I> is `<B>-</B>', then all traps <I>sig</I> are reset to their
default values.  If <I>arg</I> is the empty string, then this signal
is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

If <I>sig</I> is <B>ZERR</B> then <I>arg</I> will be executed
after each command with a nonzero exit status.

after each command.
If <I>sig</I> is <B>0</B> or <B>EXIT</B>

then the command <I>arg</I> is executed after the function completes.
If <I>sig</I> is <B>0</B> or <B>EXIT</B>
and the <B>trap</B> statement is not executed inside the body of a function,
then the command <I>arg</I> is executed when the shell terminates.

<P>

Note that traps defined with the <B>trap</B> builtin are slightly different
from those defined as `<B>TRAP</B><I>NAL</I> () { ... }', as the latter have
their own function environment (line numbers, local variables, etc.) while
the former use the environment of the command in which they were called.
For example,

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT><B>ttyctl</B> <B>-fu</B><DD>
The <B>-f</B> option freezes the tty, and <B>-u</B> unfreezes it.
When the tty is frozen, no changes made to the tty settings by
external programs will be honored by the shell, except for changes in the
size of the screen; the shell will
simply reset the settings to their previous values as soon as each
command exits or is suspended.  Thus, <B>stty</B> and similar programs have
no effect when the tty is frozen.  Without options it reports whether the
terminal is frozen or not.

Set or display attributes and values for shell parameters.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

A parameter is created for each <I>name</I> that does not already refer
to one.  When inside a function, a new parameter is created for every
<I>name</I> (even those that already exist), and is unset again when the
function completes.  See
`Local Parameters' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1).  The same rules apply to special shell parameters, which
retain their special attributes when made local.
<P>

For each <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I> assignment, the parameter
<I>name</I> is set to <I>value</I>.  Note that arrays currently cannot be
assigned in <B>typeset</B> expressions, only scalars and integers.
<P>

If the shell option <B>TYPESET_SILENT</B> is not set, for each remaining
<I>name</I> that refers to a parameter that is set, the name and value of the
parameter are printed in the form of an assignment.  Nothing is printed for
newly-created parameters, or when any attribute flags listed below are
given along with the <I>name</I>.  Using `<B>+</B>' instead of minus to
introduce an attribute turns it off.
<P>

If the <B>-p</B> option is given, parameters and values are printed in the
form of a typeset comand and an assignment (which will be printed
separately for arrays and associative arrays), regardless of other flags
and options.  Note that the <B>-h</B> flag on parameters is respected; no
value will be shown for these parameters.
<P>

If the <B>-T</B> option is given, two or three arguments must be present (an
exception is that zero arguments are allowed to show the list of parameters
created in this fashion).  The first two are the name of a scalar and an
array parameter (in that order) that will be tied together in the manner of
<B>$PATH</B> and <B>$path</B>.  The optional third argument is a single-character
separator which will be used to join the elements of the array to form the
scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as with <B>$PATH</B>.  Only the first
character of the separator is significant; any remaining characters are
ignored.  Only the scalar parameter may be assigned an initial value.  Both
the scalar and the array may otherwise be manipulated as normal.  If one is
unset, the other will automatically be unset too.  There is no way of
untying the variables without unsetting them, or converting the type of one
of them with another <B>typeset</B> command; <B>+T</B> does not work, assigning
an array to <I>SCALAR</I> is an error, and assigning a scalar to <I>array</I>
sets it to be a single-element array.  Note that both `<B>typeset -xT ...</B>'
and `<B>export -T ...</B>' work, but only the scalar will be marked for
export.  Setting the value using the scalar version causes a split on all
separators (which cannot be quoted).
<P>

The <B>-g</B> (global) flag is treated specially: it means that any
resulting parameter will not be restricted to local scope.  Note that this
does not necessarily mean that the parameter will be global, as the flag
will apply to any existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing
function.  This flag does not affect the parameter after creation, hence it
has no effect when listing existing parameters, nor does the flag <B>+g</B>
have any effect except in combination with <B>-m</B> (see below).
<P>

If no <I>name</I> is present, the names and values of all parameters are
printed.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the display to only
those parameters that have the specified attributes, and using `<B>+</B>'
rather than `<B>-</B>' to introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values
of parameters when there is no parameter name.  Also, if the last option
is the word `<B>+</B>', then names are printed but values are not.
<P>

If the <B>-m</B> flag is given the <I>name</I> arguments are taken as patterns
(which should be quoted).  With no attribute flags, all parameters (or
functions with the <B>-f</B> flag) with matching names are printed (the shell
option <B>TYPESET_SILENT</B> is not used in this case).  Note that <B>-m</B> is
ignored if no patterns are given.  If the <B>+g</B> flag is combined with
<B>-m</B>, a new local parameter is created for every matching parameter that
is not already local.  Otherwise <B>-m</B> applies all other flags or
assignments to the existing parameters.  Except when assignments are made
with <I>name</I><B>=</B><I>value</I>, using <B>+m</B> forces the matching parameters
to be printed, even inside a function.
<P>

If no attribute flags are given and either no <B>-m</B> flag is present or
the <B>+m</B> form was used, each parameter name printed is preceded by a
list of the attributes of that parameter (<B>array</B>, <B>association</B>,
<B>exported</B>, <B>integer</B>, <B>readonly</B>).  If <B>+m</B> is used with attribute
flags, and all those flags are introduced with <B>+</B>, the matching
parameter names are printed but their values are not.
<P>

The following attribute flags may be specified:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-A</B>
The names refer to associative array parameters; see
`Array Parameters' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1).
<DT><B>-L</B><DD>
Left justify and remove leading blanks from <I>value</I>.
If <I>n</I> is nonzero, it defines the width of the field;
otherwise it is determined by the width of the value of the first
assignment.
When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right with
blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the field.
Leading zeros are removed if the <B>-Z</B> flag is also set.
<DT><B>-R</B><DD>
Right justify and fill with leading blanks.  If <I>n</I> is nonzero
if defines the width of the field;
otherwise it is determined by the width of the value of the first
assignment.
When the parameter is expanded, the field is left filled with
blanks or truncated from the end.
<DT><B>-U</B><DD>
For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only the first
occurrence of each duplicated value.  This may also be set for
colon-separated special parameters like <B>PATH</B> or <B>FIGNORE</B>, etc.
This flag has a different meaning when used with <B>-f</B>; see below.
<DT><B>-Z</B><DD>
Right justify and fill with leading zeros if the first non-blank
character is a digit and the <B>-L</B> flag has not been set.
If <I>n</I> is nonzero it defines the width of the field;
otherwise it is determined by the width of the value of the
first assignment.
<DT><B>-a</B><DD>
The names refer to array parameters.  An array parameter may be
created this way, but it may not be assigned to in the <B>typeset</B>
statement.  When displaying, both normal and associative arrays are
shown.
<DT><B>-f</B><DD>
The names refer to functions rather than parameters.  No assignments
can be made, and the only other valid flags are <B>-t</B>, <B>-u</B> and
<B>-U</B>.  The flag <B>-t</B> turns on execution tracing for this
function.  The <B>-u</B> and <B>-U</B> flags cause the function to be
marked for autoloading; <B>-U</B> also causes alias expansion to be
suppressed when the function is loaded.  The <B>fpath</B> parameter
will be searched to find the function definition when the function
is first referenced; see the section `Functions'.
<DT><B>-h</B><DD>
Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `&lt;S&gt;' in the table in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshparams.1.php">zshparams</A></I>(1)), and for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter,
though harmless for others.  A special parameter with this attribute will
not retain its special effect when made local.  Thus after `<B>typeset -h
PATH</B>', a function containing `<B>typeset PATH</B>' will create an ordinary
local parameter without the usual behaviour of <B>PATH</B>.  Alternatively,
the local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a
function `<B>typeset -h PATH</B>' creates an ordinary local parameter and the
special <B>PATH</B> parameter is not altered in any way.  It is also possible
to create a local parameter using `<B>typeset +h </B><I>special</I>', where the
local copy of <I>special</I> will retain its special properties regardless of
having the <B>-h</B> attribute.  Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in <B>zsh/mapfile</B> and <B>zsh/parameter</B>) are
automatically given the <B>-h</B> attribute to avoid name clashes.
<DT><B>-H</B><DD>
Hide value: specifies that <B>typeset</B> will not display the value of the
parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is
always as if the `<B>+</B>' flag had been given.  Use of the parameter is
in other respects normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter is
specified by name, or by pattern with the <B>-m</B> option.  This is on by
default for the parameters in the <B>zsh/parameter</B> and <B>zsh/mapfile</B>
modules.  Note, however, that unlike the <B>-h</B> flag this is also useful
for non-special parameters.
<DT><B>-i</B><DD>
Use an internal integer representation.  If <I>n</I> is nonzero it
defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise it is determined by the
first assignment.
<DT><B>-E</B><DD>
Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output
the variable will be converted to scientific notation.  If <I>n</I> is
nonzero it defines the number of significant figures to display; the
default is ten.
<DT><B>-F</B><DD>
Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output
the variable will be converted to fixed-point decimal notation.  If <I>n</I>
is nonzero it defines the number of digits to display after the decimal
point; the default is ten.
<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
Convert the result to lower case whenever the parameter is expanded.
The value is <I>not</I> converted when assigned.
<DT><B>-r</B><DD>
The given <I>name</I>s are marked readonly.  Note that if <I>name</I> is a
special parameter, the readonly attribute can be turned on, but cannot then
be turned off.
<DT><B>-t</B><DD>
Tags the named parameters.  Tags have no special meaning to the shell.
This flag has a different meaning when used with <B>-f</B>; see above.
<DT><B>-u</B><DD>
Convert the result to upper case whenever the parameter is expanded.
The value is <I>not</I> converted when assigned.
This flag has a different meaning when used with <B>-f</B>; see above.
<DT><B>-x</B><DD>
Mark for automatic export to the environment of subsequently
executed commands.  If the option <B>GLOBAL_EXPORT</B> is set, this implies
the option <B>-g</B>, unless <B>+g</B> is also explicitly given; in other words
the parameter is not made local to the enclosing function.  This is for
compatibility with previous versions of zsh.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>ulimit</B> [ <B>-SHacdflmnpstv</B> [ <I>limit</I> ] ... ]<DD>
Set or display resource limits of the shell and the processes started by
the shell.  The value of <I>limit</I> can be a number in the unit specified
below or the value `<B>unlimited</B>'.  By default, only soft limits are
manipulated. If the <B>-H</B> flag is given use
hard limits instead of soft limits.  If the <B>-S</B> flag is given
together with the <B>-H</B> flag set both hard and soft limits.  If no
options are used, the file size limit (<B>-f</B>) is assumed.  If
<I>limit</I> is omitted the current value of the specified resources are
printed.  When more than one resource values are printed the limit name and
unit is printed before each value.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B><DD>
Lists all of the current resource limits.
<DT><B>-c</B><DD>
512-byte blocks on the size of core dumps.
<DT><B>-d</B><DD>
K-bytes on the size of the data segment.
<DT><B>-f</B><DD>
512-byte blocks on the size of files written.
<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
K-bytes on the size of locked-in memory.
<DT><B>-m</B><DD>
K-bytes on the size of physical memory.
<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
open file descriptors.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
K-bytes on the size of the stack.
<DT><B>-t</B><DD>
CPU seconds to be used.
<DT><B>-u</B><DD>
processes available to the user.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
K-bytes on the size of virtual memory.  On some systems this
refers to the limit called `address space'.

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>umask</B> [ <B>-S</B> ] [ <I>mask</I> ]<DD>
The umask is set to <I>mask</I>.  <I>mask</I> can be either
an octal number or a symbolic value as described in <I><A HREF="../man1/chmod.1.php">chmod</A></I>(1).
If <I>mask</I> is omitted, the current value is printed.  The <B>-S</B>
option causes the mask to be printed as a symbolic value.  Otherwise,
the mask is printed as an octal number.  Note that in
the symbolic form the permissions you specify are those which are to be
allowed (not denied) to the users specified.
<DT><B>unalias</B><DD>
Same as <B>unhash -a</B>.
<DT><B>unfunction</B><DD>
Same as <B>unhash -f</B>.
<DT><B>unhash</B> [ <B>-adfms</B> ] <I>name</I> ...<DD>
Remove the element named <I>name</I> from an internal hash table.  The
default is remove elements from the command hash table.  The <B>-a</B>
option causes <B>unhash</B> to remove regular or global aliases.
The <B>-s</B> option causes <B>unhash</B> to remove suffix aliases.
The <B>-f</B> option causes
<B>unhash</B> to remove shell functions.  The <B>-d</B> options causes
<B>unhash</B> to remove named directories.  If the <B>-m</B> flag is given
the arguments are taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all elements
of the corresponding hash table with matching names will be removed.
<DT><B>unlimit</B> [ <B>-hs</B> ] <I>resource</I> ...<DD>
The resource limit for each <I>resource</I> is set to the hard limit.
If the <B>-h</B> flag is given and the shell has appropriate privileges,
the hard resource limit for each <I>resource</I> is removed.
The resources of the shell process are only changed if the <B>-s</B>
flag is given.
<DT><B>unset</B> [ <B>-fmv</B> ] <I>name</I> ...<DD>
Each named parameter is unset.
Local parameters remain local even if unset; they appear unset within scope,
but the previous value will still reappear when the scope ends.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Individual elements of associative array parameters may be unset by using
subscript syntax on <I>name</I>, which should be quoted (or the entire command
prefixed with <B>noglob</B>) to protect the subscript from filename generation.
<P>

If the <B>-m</B> flag is specified the arguments are taken as patterns (should
be quoted) and all parameters with matching names are unset.  Note that this
cannot be used when unsetting associative array elements, as the subscript
will be treated as part of the pattern.
<P>

The <B>-v</B> flag specifies that <I>name</I> refers to parameters. This is the
default behaviour.
<P>

<B>unset -f</B> is equivalent to <B>unfunction</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>unsetopt</B> [ {<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>}<I>options</I> | {<B>+</B>|<B>-</B>}<B>o</B> <I>option_name</I> ] [ <I>name</I> ... ]<DD>
Unset the options for the shell.  All options specified either
with flags or by name are unset.  If no arguments are supplied,
the names of all options currently unset are printed.
If the <B>-m</B> flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns
(which should be quoted to preserve them from being interpreted as glob
patterns), and all options with names matching these patterns are unset.
<DT><B>vared</B><DD>
See the section `Zle Builtins' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1).
<DT><B>wait</B> [ <I>job</I> ... ]<DD>
Wait for the specified jobs or processes.  If <I>job</I> is not given
then all currently active child processes are waited for.
Each <I>job</I> can be either a job specification or the process ID
of a job in the job table.
The exit status from this command is that of the job waited for.
<DT><B>whence</B> [ <B>-vcwfpams</B> ] <I>name</I> ...<DD>
For each name, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a
command name.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-v</B>
Produce a more verbose report.
<DT><B>-c</B><DD>
Print the results in a <B>csh</B>-like format.
This takes precedence over <B>-v</B>.
<DT><B>-w</B><DD>
For each <I>name</I>, print `<I>name</I><B>:</B> <I>word</I>' where <I>word</I>
is one of <B>alias</B>, <B>builtin</B>, <B>command</B>, <B>function</B>,
<B>hashed</B>, <B>reserved</B> or <B>none</B>, according as <I>name</I>
corresponds to an alias, a built-in command, an external command, a
shell function, a command defined with the <B>hash</B> builtin, a
reserved word, or is not recognised.  This takes precedence over
<B>-v</B> and <B>-c</B>.
<DT><B>-f</B><DD>
Causes the contents of a shell function to be
displayed, which would otherwise not happen unless the <B>-c</B>
flag were used.
<DT><B>-p</B><DD>
Do a path search for <I>name</I>
even if it is an alias, reserved word, shell function or builtin.
<DT><B>-a</B><DD>
Do a search for all occurrences of <I>name</I>
throughout the command path.
Normally only the first occurrence is printed.
<DT><B>-m</B><DD>
The arguments are taken as patterns (should be
quoted), and the information is displayed for each command matching one
of these patterns.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
If a pathname contains symlinks, print the symlink-free pathname as well.

<DT><B>where</B> [ <B>-wpms</B> ] <I>name</I> ...<DD>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>zcompile -t</B> <I>file</I> [ <I>name</I> ... ]
This builtin command can be used to compile functions or scripts,
storing the compiled form in a file, and to examine files containing
the compiled form.  This allows faster autoloading of functions and
execution of scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files
are read.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The first form (without the <B>-c</B>, <B>-a</B> or <B>-t</B> options) creates a
compiled file.  If only the <I>file</I> argument is given, the
output file has the name `<I>file</I><B>.zwc</B>' and will be placed in
the same directory as the <I>file</I>.  The shell will load the compiled
file instead of the normal function file when the function
is autoloaded; see
the section `Autoloading Functions' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshfunc.1.php">zshfunc</A></I>(1)
for a description of how autoloaded functions are searched.  The
extension <B>.zwc</B> stands for `zsh word code'.
<P>

If there is at least one <I>name</I> argument, all the named files
are compiled into the output <I>file</I> given as the first argument.  If
<I>file</I> does not end in <B>.zwc</B>, this extension is automatically
appended.  Files containing multiple compiled functions are called `digest'
files, and are intended to be used as elements of the <B>FPATH</B>/<B>fpath</B>
special array.
<P>

The second form, with the <B>-c</B> or <B>-a</B> options, writes the compiled
definitions for all the named functions into <I>file</I>.  For <B>-c</B>, the
names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not those marked
for autoloading.  Undefined functions that are marked for autoloading
may be written by using the <B>-a</B> option, in which case the <B>fpath</B>
is searched and the contents of the definition files for those
functions, if found, are compiled into <I>file</I>.  If both <B>-c</B> and
<B>-a</B> are given, names of both defined functions and functions marked
for autoloading may be given.  In either case, the functions in files
written with the <B>-c</B> or <B>-a</B> option will be autoloaded as if the
<B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> option were unset.
<P>

The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded functions with
different options is that some definition files for autoloading define
multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the
file, and, at the end, call that function.  In such cases the output of
`<B>zcompile -c</B>' does not include the additional functions defined in
the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost.  Using
`<B>zcompile -a</B>' captures all this extra information.
<P>

If the <B>-m</B> option is combined with <B>-c</B> or <B>-a</B>,
the <I>name</I>s are used as patterns and all functions whose names
match one of these patterns will be written. If no <I>name</I> is given,
the definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as
autoloaded will be written.
<P>

The third form, with the <B>-t</B> option, examines an existing
compiled file.  Without further arguments, the names of the original
files compiled into it are listed.  The first line of output shows
the version of the shell which compiled the file and how the file
will be used (i.e. by reading it directly or by mapping it into memory).
With arguments, nothing is output and the return value is set to zero if
definitions for <I>all</I> <I>name</I>s were found in the compiled
file, and non-zero if the definition for at least one <I>name</I> was not
found.
<P>

Other options:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-U</B>
Aliases are not expanded when compiling the <I>name</I>d files.
<DT><B>-R</B><DD>
When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied into the
shell's memory, rather than memory-mapped (see <B>-M</B>).  This
happens automatically on systems that do not support memory mapping.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is
often desirable to use this option; otherwise the whole file, including the
code to define functions which have already been defined, will
remain mapped, consequently wasting memory.
</DL>

<DT><B>-M</B><DD>
The compiled file is mapped into the shell's memory when read. This
is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running
on the same host will share this mapped file.  If neither <B>-R</B> nor
<B>-M</B> is given, the <B>zcompile</B> builtin decides what to do based
on the size of the compiled file.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-k</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-z</B>
These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which
are to be autoloaded. If <B>-z</B> is given, the
function will be autoloaded as if the <B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> option is
<I>not</I> set, even if it is set at the time the compiled file is
read, while if the <B>-k</B> is given, the function will be loaded as if
<B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> <I>is</I> set.  If neither of these options is given, the
function will be loaded as determined by the setting of the
<B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> option at the time the compiled file is read.
<BR>&nbsp;
These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed
<I>name</I>s to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to
the next <B>-k</B> or <B>-z</B>.
<P>
The created file always contains two versions of the compiled
format, one for big-endian machines and one for small-endian
machines.  The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine
independent and if it is read or mapped, only one half of the file
is actually used (and mapped).

Loading of modules while the shell is running (`dynamical loading') is not
available on all operating systems, or on all installations on a particular
operating system, although the <B>zmodload</B> command itself is always
available and can be used to manipulate modules built into versions of the
shell executable without dynamical loading.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules are

<DT>
<DD>
<B>zmodload</B> <B>-u</B> [ <B>-i</B> ] <I>name</I> ...
In the simplest case, <B>zmodload</B> loads a binary module.  The module must
be in a file with a name consisting of the specified <I>name</I> followed by
a standard suffix, usually `<B>.so</B>' (`<B>.sl</B>' on HPUX).
If the module to be loaded is
already loaded and the <B>-i</B> option is given, the duplicate module is
ignored.  Otherwise <B>zmodload</B> prints an error message.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>name</I>d module is searched for in the same way a command is, using
<B>$module_path</B> instead of <B>$path</B>.  However, the path search is
performed even when the module name contains a `<B>/</B>', which it usually does.
There is no way to prevent the path search.
<P>

With <B>-u</B>, <B>zmodload</B> unloads modules.  The same <I>name</I>
must be given that was given when the module was loaded, but it is not
necessary for the module to exist in the filesystem.
The <B>-i</B> option suppresses the error if the module is already
unloaded (or was never loaded).
<P>

Each module has a boot and a cleanup function.  The module
will not be loaded if its boot function fails.  Similarly a module
can only be unloaded if its cleanup function runs successfully.

in the first argument is loaded.  If only the <I>name</I> is given, one
builtin is defined, with the same name as the module.  <B>-i</B> suppresses
the error if the builtin is already defined or autoloaded, regardless of
which module it came from.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

If given no condition names, all defined names are listed (as a series of

The <B>-e</B> option without arguments lists all loaded modules; if the <B>-A</B>
option is also given, module aliases corresponding to loaded modules are
also shown.  With arguments only the return status is set to zero
if all <I>string</I>s given as arguments are names of loaded modules
and to one if at least on <I>string</I> is not the name of a
loaded module.  This can be used to test for the availability 
of things implemented by modules.  In this case, any aliases are
automatically resolved and the <B>-A</B> flag is not used.
<DT><B>zmodload</B> <B>-A</B> [ <B>-L</B> ] [ <I>modalias</I>[<B>=</B><I>module</I>] ... ]<DD>
For each argument, if both <I>modalias</I> and <I>module</I> are given,
define <I>modalias</I> to be an alias for the module <I>module</I>.
If the module <I>modalias</I> is ever subsequently requested, either via a
call to <B>zmodload</B> or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load
<I>module</I> instead.  If <I>module</I> is not given, show the definition of
<I>modalias</I>.  If no arguments are given, list all defined module aliases.
When listing, if the <B>-L</B> flag was also given, list the definition as a
<B>zmodload</B> command to recreate the alias.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of whether
the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists,
loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same
effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by
<B>zmodload -R</B> or by redefining the alias.  Chains of aliases (i.e. where
the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are
not circular.  As the aliases take the same format as module names, they
may include path separators:  in this case, there is no requirement for any
part of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first.  For
example, `<B>any/old/alias</B>' is always a valid alias.
<P>

Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved
module; these remain if the alias is removed.  It is valid to create an
alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to
a different module.  However, if a module has dependencies, it
will not be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will
already be marked as a loadable module in its own right.
<P>

Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the <B>zmodload</B> command
anywhere module names are required.  However, aliases will not be
shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `<B>zmodload</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>zmodload</B> <B>-R</B> <I>modalias</I> ... <DD>
For each <I>modalias</I> argument that was previously defined as a module
alias via <B>zmodload -A</B>, delete the alias.  If any was not defined, an
error is caused and the remainder of the line is ignored.
</DL>
<P>

Note that <B>zsh</B> makes no distinction between modules that were linked 
into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically. In both cases
this builtin command has to be used to make available the builtins and
other things defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on
these definitions). This is true even for systems that don't support
dynamic loading of modules.

<A NAME="lbDJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

zshzle - zsh command line editor

<A NAME="lbDK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

If the <B>ZLE</B> option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells)
and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user
is able to edit command lines.
<P>

There are two display modes.  The first, multiline mode, is the
default.  It only works if the <B>TERM</B> parameter is set to a valid
terminal type that can move the cursor up.  The second, single line
mode, is used if <B>TERM</B> is invalid or incapable of moving the
cursor up, or if the <B>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</B> option is set.
This mode
is similar to <B>ksh</B>, and uses no termcap sequences.  If <B>TERM</B> is
&quot;emacs&quot;, the <B>ZLE</B> option will be unset by default.
<P>

The parameters <B>BAUD</B>, <B>COLUMNS</B>, and <B>LINES</B> are also used by the
line editor.
See <I>Parameters Used By The Shell</I> in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1).
<P>

<P>

<A NAME="lbDL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>KEYMAPS</H2>

A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences
and ZLE commands.  The empty key sequence cannot be bound.
<P>

There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one
or more names.  If all of a keymap's names are deleted, it disappears.
<B>bindkey</B> can be used to manipulate keymap names.
<P>

Initially, there are four keymaps:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>emacs</B><DD>
EMACS emulation
<DT><B>viins</B><DD>
vi emulation - insert mode
<DT><B>vicmd</B><DD>
vi emulation - command mode
<DT><B>.safe</B><DD>
fallback keymap

</DL>
<P>

The `<B>.safe</B>' keymap is special.  It can never be altered, and the name
can never be removed.  However, it can be linked to other names, which can
be removed.  In the future other special keymaps may be added; users should
avoid using names beginning with `<B>.</B>' for their own keymaps.
<P>

In addition to these four names, either `<B>emacs</B>' or `<B>viins</B>' is
also linked to the name `<B>main</B>'.  If one of the <B>VISUAL</B> or
<B>EDITOR</B> environment variables contain the string `<B>vi</B>' when the shell
starts up then it will be `<B>viins</B>', otherwise it will be `<B>emacs</B>'.
<B>bindkey</B>'s <B>-e</B> and <B>-v</B>
options provide a convenient way to override this default choice.
<P>

When the editor starts up, it will select the `<B>main</B>' keymap.
If that keymap doesn't exist, it will use `<B>.safe</B>' instead.
<P>

In the `<B>.safe</B>' keymap, each single key is bound to <B>self-insert</B>,
except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to <B>accept-line</B>.
This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it
means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back.
<A NAME="lbDM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Reading Commands</H3>

When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence
that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string.
In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more characters
are typed, and if not (or they don't match any longer string) it will
execute the binding.  This timeout is defined by the <B>KEYTIMEOUT</B> parameter;
its default is 0.4 sec.  There is no timeout if the prefix string is not
itself bound to a command.
<P>

As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by using
`<B>bindkey -s</B>'.
When such a sequence is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input,
and the command reading process starts again using these fake keystrokes.
This input can itself invoke further replacement strings, but in order to
detect loops the process will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements
without a real command being read.
<P>

<A NAME="lbDN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ZLE BUILTINS</H2>

The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The <B>bindkey</B>
command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the <B>vared</B> command invokes
ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the <B>zle</B> command manipulates
editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within
shell functions.

<B>bindkey</B> [ <I>options</I> ] [ <I>in-string</I> ]
<B>bindkey</B>'s options can be divided into three categories: keymap selection,
operation selection, and others.  The keymap selection options are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-e</B>
Selects keymap `<B>emacs</B>', and also links it to `<B>main</B>'.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
Selects keymap `<B>viins</B>', and also links it to `<B>main</B>'.
<DT><B>-a</B><DD>
Selects keymap `<B>vicmd</B>'.
<DT><B>-M</B> <I>keymap</I><DD>
The <I>keymap</I> specifies a keymap name.
</DL>
<P>

If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above are used, the
`<B>main</B>' keymap is used.  Some operations do not permit a keymap to be
selected, namely:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-l</B>
List all existing keymap names.  If the <B>-L</B>
option is also used, list in the form of <B>bindkey</B>
commands to create the keymaps.
<DT><B>-d</B><DD>
Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default state.
<DT><B>-D</B> <I>keymap</I> ...<DD>
Delete the named <I>keymap</I>s.
<DT><B>-A</B> <I>old-keymap new-keymap</I><DD>
Make the <I>new-keymap</I> name an alias for <I>old-keymap</I>, so that
both names refer to the same keymap.  The names have equal standing;
if either is deleted, the other remains.  If there is already a keymap
with the <I>new-keymap</I> name, it is deleted.
<DT><B>-N</B> <I>new-keymap</I> [ <I>old-keymap</I> ]<DD>
Create a new keymap, named <I>new-keymap</I>.  If a keymap already has that
name, it is deleted.  If an <I>old-keymap</I> name is given, the new keymap
is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will
be empty.
</DL>
<P>

To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to <B>main</B>.  Hence
the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap `<B>mymap</B>'
initialized from the <B>emacs</B> keymap (which remains unchanged) is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey -N mymap emacs
bindkey -A mymap main</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Note that while `<B>bindkey -A</B> <I>newmap</I> <B>main</B>' will work when
<I>newmap</I> is <B>emacs</B> or <B>viins</B>, it will not work for <B>vicmd</B>, as
switching from vi insert to command mode becomes impossible.
<P>

The following operations act on the `<B>main</B>' keymap if no keymap
selection option was given:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-m</B>
Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the selected keymap.
Only keys that are unbound or bound to <B>self-insert</B> are affected.
<DT><B>-r</B> <I>in-string</I> ...<DD>
Unbind the specified <I>in-string</I>s in the selected keymap.
This is exactly equivalent to binding the strings to <B>undefined-key</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When <B>-R</B> is also used, interpret the <I>in-string</I>s as ranges.
<P>

When <B>-p</B> is also used, the <I>in-string</I>s specify prefixes.  Any
binding that has the given <I>in-string</I> as a prefix, not including the
binding for the <I>in-string</I> itself, if any, will be removed.  For
example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey -rpM viins '^['</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap beginning with an escape
character (probably cursor keys), but leave the binding for the escape
character itself (probably <B>vi-cmd-mode</B>).  This is incompatible with the
option <B>-R</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>-s</B> <I>in-string out-string</I> ...<DD>
Bind each <I>in-string</I> to each <I>out-string</I>.
When <I>in-string</I> is typed, <I>out-string</I> will be
pushed back and treated as input to the line editor.
When <B>-R</B> is also used, interpret the <I>in-string</I>s as ranges.
<DT><I>in-string command</I> ...<DD>
Bind each <I>in-string</I> to each <I>command</I>.
When <B>-R</B> is used, interpret the <I>in-string</I>s as ranges.
<DT>[ <I>in-string</I> ]<DD>
List key bindings.  If an <I>in-string</I> is specified, the binding of
that string in the selected keymap is displayed.  Otherwise, all key
bindings in the selected keymap are displayed.  (As a special case,
if the <B>-e</B> or <B>-v</B> option is used alone, the keymap is <I>not</I>
displayed - the implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that
happens.)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When the option <B>-p</B> is used, the <I>in-string</I> must be present.
The listing shows all bindings which have the given key sequence as a
prefix, not including any bindings for the key sequence itself.
<P>

When the <B>-L</B> option is used, the list is in the form of <B>bindkey</B>
commands to create the key bindings.
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

When the <B>-R</B> option is used as noted above, a valid range consists of
two characters, with an optional `<B>-</B>' between them.  All characters
between the two specified, inclusive, are bound as specified.
<P>

For either <I>in-string</I> or <I>out-string</I>, the following
escape sequences are recognised:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>\a</B><DD>

In all other cases, `<B>\</B>' escapes the following character.  Delete is
written as `<B>^?</B>'.  Note that `<B>\M^?</B>' and `<B>^\M?</B>' are not the same,
and that (unlike emacs), the bindings `<B>\M-</B><I>X</I>' and `<B>\e</B><I>X</I>'
are entirely distinct, although they are initialized to the same bindings
by `<B>bindkey -m</B>'.

The value of the parameter <I>name</I> is loaded into the edit
buffer, and the line editor is invoked.  When the editor exits,
<I>name</I> is set to the string value returned by the editor.
When the <B>-c</B> flag is given, the parameter is created if it doesn't
already exist.  The <B>-a</B> flag may be given with <B>-c</B> to create
an array parameter, or the <B>-A</B> flag to create an associative array.
If the type of an existing parameter does not match the type to be

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If an array or array slice is being edited, separator characters as defined
in <B>$IFS</B> will be shown quoted with a backslash, as will backslashes
themselves.  Conversely, when the edited text is split into an array, a
backslash quotes an immediately following separator character or backslash;
no other special handling of backslashes, or any handling of quotes, is
performed.
<P>

Individual elements of existing array or associative array parameters
may be edited by using subscript syntax on <I>name</I>.  New elements are
created automatically, even without <B>-c</B>.
<P>

If the <B>-p</B> flag is given, the following string will be taken as
the prompt to display at the left.  If the <B>-r</B> flag is given,
the following string gives the prompt to display at the right.  If the
<B>-h</B> flag is specified, the history can be accessed from ZLE. If the 
<B>-e</B> flag is given, typing <B>^D</B> (Control-D) on an empty line
causes <B>vared</B> to exit immediately with a non-zero return value.

<DT><B>-R</B> [ <B>-c</B> ] [ <I>display-string</I> ] [ <I>string</I> ... ]<DD>
Redisplay the command line; this is to be called from within a user-defined
widget to allow changes to become visible.  If a <I>display-string</I> is
given and not empty, this is shown in the status line (immediately
below the line being edited).
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the optional <I>string</I>s are given they are listed below the
prompt in the same way as completion lists are printed. If no
<I>string</I>s are given but the <B>-c</B> option is used such a list is
cleared.
<P>

Note that this option is only useful for widgets that do not exit
immediately after using it because the strings displayed will be erased 
immediately after return from the widget.
<P>

This command can safely be called outside user defined widgets; if zle is
active, the display will be refreshed, while if zle is not active, the
command has no effect.  In this case there will usually be no other
arguments.  The status is zero if zle was active, else one.
</DL>

<DT><B>-M</B> <I>string</I><DD>
As with the <B>-R</B> option, the <I>string</I> will be displayed below the 
command line; unlike the <B>-R</B> option, the string will not be put into
the status line but will instead be printed normally below the
prompt.  This means that the <I>string</I> will still be displayed after
the widget returns (until it is overwritten by subsequent commands).
<DT><B>-U</B> <I>string</I><DD>
This pushes the characters in the <I>string</I> onto the input stack of
ZLE.  After the widget currently executed finishes ZLE will behave as
if the characters in the <I>string</I> were typed by the user.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

As ZLE uses a stack, if this option is used repeatedly
the last string pushed onto the stack will be processed first.  However,
the characters in each <I>string</I> will be processed in the order in which
they appear in the string.
</DL>

<DT><B>-K</B> <I>keymap</I><DD>
Selects the keymap named <I>keymap</I>.  An error message will be displayed if
there is no such keymap.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This keymap selection affects the interpretation of following keystrokes
within this invocation of ZLE.  Any following invocation (e.g., the next
command line) will start as usual with the `<B>main</B>' keymap selected.
</DL>

<DT><B>-F</B> [ <B>-L</B> ] [ <I>fd</I> [ <I>handler</I> ] ]<DD>
Only available if your system supports one of the `poll' or `select' system
calls; most modern systems do.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Installs <I>handler</I> (the name of a shell function) to handle input from
file descriptor <I>fd</I>.  When zle is attempting to read data, it will
examine both the terminal and the list of handled <I>fd</I>'s.  If data
becomes available on a handled <I>fd</I>, zle will call <I>handler</I> with
the fd which is ready for reading as the only argument.  If the handler
produces output to the terminal, it should call `<B>zle -I</B>' before doing
so (see below).  The handler should not attempt to read from the terminal.
Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this fd is actually
readable when installing the handler.  The user must make their own
arrangements for handling the file descriptor when zle is not active.
<P>

Any number of handlers for any number of readable file descriptors may be
installed.  Installing a handler for an <I>fd</I> which is already handled
causes the existing handler to be replaced.
<P>

If no <I>handler</I> is given, but an <I>fd</I> is present, any handler for
that <I>fd</I> is removed.  If there is none, an error message is printed
and status 1 is returned.
<P>

If no arguments are given, or the <B>-L</B> option is supplied, a list of
handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later execution.
<P>

An <I>fd</I> (but not a <I>handler</I>) may optionally be given with the <B>-L</B>
option; in this case, the function will list the handler if any, else
silently return status 1.
<P>

Note that this feature should be used with care.  Activity on one of the
<I>fd</I>'s which is not properly handled can cause the terminal to become
unusable.
<P>

Here is a simple example of using this feature.  A connection to a remote
TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see 
the description of the <B>zsh/net/tcp</B> module in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).  Then a handler is installed
which simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection.  Note
that `select' will indicate that the file descriptor needs handling
if the remote side has closed the connection; we handle that by testing
for a failed read.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>if ztcp pwspc 2811; then
  tcpfd=$REPLY
  handler() {
    zle -I
    local line
    if ! read -r line &lt;&amp;$1; then
      # select marks this fd if we reach EOF,
      # so handle this specially.
      print &quot;[Read on fd $1 failed, removing.]&quot; &gt;&amp;2
      zle -F $1
      return 1
    fi
    print -r - $line
  }
  zle -F $tcpfd handler
fi</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>-I</B><DD>
Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary widget functions,
though it may be used within if normal output to the terminal is required.
It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output; typically
this will be from a trap function.  It has no effect if zle is not
active.  When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display needs
restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as not to
disturb the line being edited:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>TRAPUSR1() {
    # Invalidate zle display
  [[ -o zle ]] &amp;&amp; zle -I
    # Show output
  print Hello
}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is active before
using this method (as shown in the example), since the <B>zsh/zle</B> module
may not even be loaded; if it is not, the command can be skipped.
<P>

It is possible to call `<B>zle -I</B>' several times before control is
returned to the editor; the display will only be invalidated the first time
to minimise disruption.
<P>

Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating the display from
within zle widgets; see, for example, `<B>zle -R</B>' above.
<P>

The status is zero if zle is active and the current zle display has
been invalidated (even if this was by a previous call to `<B>zle -I</B>'),
else one.
</DL>

<DT><I>widget</I> <B>[ -n</B> <I>num</I> <B>]</B> <B>[ -N ]</B> <I>args</I> ...<DD>
Invoke the specified widget.  This can only be done when ZLE is
active; normally this will be within a user-defined widget.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With the options <B>-n</B> and <B>-N</B>, the current numerical argument will be
saved and then restored after the call to <B>widget</B>; `<B>-n</B> <I>num</I>'
sets the numerical argument temporarily to <I>num</I>, while `<B>-N</B>' sets it
to the default, i.e. as if there were none.
<P>

Any further arguments will be passed to the widget.  If it is a shell
function, these are passed down as positional parameters; for builtin
widgets it is up to the widget in question what it does with them.
Currently arguments are only handled by the incremental-search commands,
the <B>history-search-forward</B> and <B>-backward</B> and the corresponding
functions prefixed by <B>vi-</B>, and by <B>universal-argument</B>.  No error is
flagged if the command does not use the arguments, or only uses some of
them.
<P>

The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation carried
out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget the return status of
the shell function.  
<P>

A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget exits,
unless the <B>BEEP</B> options was unset or the widget was called via the
<B>zle</B> command.  Thus if a user defined widget requires an immediate beep,
it should call the <B>beep</B> widget directly.
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

With no options and no arguments, only the return status will be
set. It is zero if ZLE is currently active and widgets could be
invoked using this builtin command and non-zero if ZLE is not active.


<P>

<A NAME="lbDO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WIDGETS</H2>

All actions in the editor are performed by `widgets'.  A widget's job is
simply to perform some small action.  The ZLE commands that key sequences
in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets.  Widgets can be user-defined
or built in.
<P>

The standard widgets built in to ZLE are listed in Standard Widgets below.
Other built-in widgets can be defined by other modules (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)).  Each built-in widget has two names: its normal canonical name, and the
same name preceded by a `<B>.</B>'.  The `<B>.</B>' name is special: it can't be
rebound to a different widget.  This makes the widget available even when
its usual name has been redefined.
<P>

User-defined widgets are defined using `<B>zle -N</B>', and implemented
as shell functions.  When the widget is executed, the corresponding
shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions.
It is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names
starting with `<B>.</B>'.
<A NAME="lbDP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USER-DEFINED WIDGETS</H2>

User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions,
can execute any normal shell command.  They can also run other widgets
(whether built-in or user-defined) using the <B>zle</B> builtin command.
The standard input of the function is closed to prevent external commands
from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but
<B>read -k</B> or <B>read -q</B> can be used to read characters.  Finally,
they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by
reading and setting the special parameters described below.
<P>

These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but
are not in any way special outside ZLE.  If they have some normal value
outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return
when the widget function exits.  These special parameters in fact have
local scope, like parameters created in a function using <B>local</B>.
<P>

Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active, these
parameters are available read-only.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>BUFFER</B> (scalar)
The entire contents of the edit buffer.  If it is written to, the
cursor remains at the same offset, unless that would put it outside the
buffer.
<DT><B>BUFFERLINES</B> (integer)<DD>
The number of screen lines needed for the edit buffer currently
displayed on screen (i.e. without any changes to the preceding
parameters done after the last redisplay); read-only.
<DT><B>CONTEXT</B> (scalar)<DD>
The context in which zle was called to read a line; read-only.  One of
the values:

<DT>
<DD>
start
The start of a command line (at prompt <B>PS1</B>).
<DT>cont<DD>
A continuation to a command line (at prompt <B>PS2</B>).
<DT>select<DD>
In a <B>select</B> loop.
<DT>vared<DD>
Editing a variable in <B>vared</B>.

<DT><B>CURSOR</B> (integer)<DD>
The offset of the cursor, within the edit buffer.  This is in the range
0 to <B>$#BUFFER</B>, and is by definition equal to <B>$#LBUFFER</B>.
Attempts to move the cursor outside the buffer will result in the
cursor being moved to the appropriate end of the buffer.
<DT><B>CUTBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
The last item to be cut using one of the `<B>kill-</B>' commands; the
string which the next yank would insert in the line.
<DT><B>HISTNO</B> (integer)<DD>
The current history number; read-only.
<DT><B>KEYMAP</B> (scalar)<DD>
The name of the currently selected keymap; read-only.
<DT><B>KEYS</B> (scalar)<DD>
The keys typed to invoke this widget, as a literal string; read-only.
<DT><B>killring</B> (array)<DD>
The array of previously killed items, with the most recently killed first.
This gives the items that would be retrieved by a <B>yank-pop</B> in the
same order.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default size for the kill ring is eight, however the length may be
changed by normal array operations.  Any empty string in the kill ring is
ignored by the <B>yank-pop</B> command, hence the size of the array
effectively sets the maximum length of the kill ring, while the number of
non-zero strings gives the current length, both as seen by the user at the
command line.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>LASTSEARCH</B> (scalar)<DD>
The last search string used by an interactive search ; read-only.
<DT><B>LASTWIDGET</B> (scalar)<DD>
The name of the last widget that was executed; read-only.
<DT><B>LBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
The part of the buffer that lies to the left of the cursor position.
If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the
cursor remains between the new <B>$LBUFFER</B> and the old <B>$RBUFFER</B>.
<DT><B>MARK</B> (integer)<DD>
Like <B>CURSOR</B>, but for the mark.
<DT><B>NUMERIC</B> (integer)<DD>
The numeric argument. If no numeric argument was given, this parameter
is unset. When this is set inside a widget function, builtin widgets
called with the <B>zle</B> builtin command will use the value
assigned. If it is unset inside a widget function, builtin widgets
called behave as if no numeric argument was given.
<DT><B>PENDING</B> (integer)<DD>
The number of bytes pending for input, i.e. the number of bytes which have
already been typed and can immediately be read. On systems where the shell
is not able to get this information, this parameter will always have a
value of zero.  Read-only.
<DT><B>PREBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
In a multi-line input at the secondary prompt, this read-only parameter
contains the contents of the lines before the one the cursor is
currently in.
<DT><B>PREDISPLAY</B> (scalar)<DD>
Text to be displayed before the start of the editable text buffer.  This
does not have to be a complete line; to display a complete line, a newline
must be appended explicitly.    The text is reset on each new invocation
(but not recursive invocation) of zle.
<DT><B>POSTDISPLAY</B> (scalar)<DD>
Text to be displayed after the end of the editable text buffer.  This
does not have to be a complete line; to display a complete line, a newline
must be prepended explicitly.  The text is reset on each new invocation
(but not recursive invocation) of zle.
<DT><B>RBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
The part of the buffer that lies to the right of the cursor position.
If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the
cursor remains between the old <B>$LBUFFER</B> and the new <B>$RBUFFER</B>.
<DT><B>WIDGET</B> (scalar)<DD>
The name of the widget currently being executed; read-only.

<H2>STANDARD WIDGETS</H2>

The following is a list of all the standard widgets,

vi command mode and vi insert mode
(the `<B>emacs</B>', `<B>vicmd</B>' and `<B>viins</B>' keymaps, respectively).
<P>

Note that cursor keys are bound to movement keys in all three keymaps;
the shell assumes that the cursor keys send the key sequences reported
by the terminal-handling library (termcap or terminfo).  The key sequences
shown in the list are those based on the VT100, common on many modern
terminals, but in fact these are not necessarily bound.  In the case of the
<B>viins</B> keymap, the initial escape character of the sequences serves also
to return to the <B>vicmd</B> keymap: whether this happens is determined by
the <B>KEYTIMEOUT</B> parameter, see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1).

<P>

A restricted set of editing functions
is available in the mini-buffer.  An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty

<B>clear-screen</B>,
<B>redisplay</B>,
<B>quoted-insert</B>,
<B>vi-quoted-insert</B>,

<B>accept-and-infer-next-history</B>,
<B>accept-line</B> and
<B>accept-line-and-down-history</B>.
<P>

<B>magic-space</B> just inserts a space.
<B>vi-cmd-mode</B> toggles between the `<B>main</B>' and `<B>vicmd</B>' keymaps;
the `<B>main</B>' keymap (insert mode) will be selected initially.
<B>history-incremental-search-backward</B> will get the
next occurrence of the contents of the mini-buffer.
<B>history-incremental-search-forward</B> inverts the sense of the search.
<B>vi-repeat-search</B> and <B>vi-rev-repeat-search</B> are similarly supported.
The direction of the search is indicated in the mini-buffer.
<P>

Any multi-character string
that is not bound to one of the above functions will beep and interrupt the
search, leaving the last found line in the buffer. Any single character that
is not bound to one of the above functions, or <B>self-insert</B> or
<B>self-insert-unmeta</B>, will have the same effect but the function will be
executed.
<P>

When called from a widget function by the <B>zle</B> command, the incremental
search commands can take a string argument.  This will be treated as a
string of keys, as for arguments to the <B>bindkey</B> command, and used as
initial input for the command.  Any characters in the string which are

mini-buffer are the same as for <B>history-incremental-search-backward</B>.
<DT><B>history-search-backward</B> (ESC-P ESC-p) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Search backward in the history for a line beginning with the first
word in the buffer.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If called from a function by the <B>zle</B> command with arguments, the first
argument is taken as the string for which to search, rather than the
first word in the buffer.
</DL>

<DT><B>vi-history-search-backward</B> (unbound) (/) (unbound)<DD>
Search backward in the history for a specified string.
The string may begin with `<B>^</B>' to anchor the search to the
beginning of the line.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

A restricted set of editing functions is available in
the mini-buffer.  An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting,  will
stop the search.
The functions available in the mini-buffer are:
<B>accept-line</B>,
<B>backward-delete-char</B>,
<B>vi-backward-delete-char</B>,
<B>backward-kill-word</B>,
<B>vi-backward-kill-word</B>,

<B>redisplay</B>,
<B>quoted-insert</B>
and
<B>vi-quoted-insert</B>.
<P>

<B>vi-cmd-mode</B> is treated the same as accept-line, and
<B>magic-space</B> is treated as a space.
Any other character that is not bound to self-insert or
self-insert-unmeta will beep and be ignored. If the function is called from vi
command mode, the bindings of the current insert mode will be used.
<P>

If called from a function by the <B>zle</B> command with arguments, the first
argument is taken as the string for which to search, rather than the
first word in the buffer.
</DL>

<DT><B>history-search-forward</B> (ESC-N ESC-n) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Search forward in the history for a line beginning with the first
word in the buffer.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If called from a function by the <B>zle</B> command with arguments, the first
argument is taken as the string for which to search, rather than the
first word in the buffer.
</DL>

<DT><B>vi-history-search-forward</B> (unbound) (?) (unbound)<DD>
Search forward in the history for a specified string.
The string may begin with `<B>^</B>' to anchor the search to the
beginning of the line. The functions available in the mini-buffer are the same
as for <B>vi-history-search-backward</B>.  Argument handling is also the same
as for that command.
<DT><B>infer-next-history</B> (^X^N) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Search in the history list for a line matching the current one and
fetch the event following it.
<DT><B>insert-last-word</B> (ESC-_ ESC-.) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Insert the last word from the previous history event at the
cursor position.  If a positive numeric argument is given,
insert that word from the end of the previous history event.
If the argument is zero or negative insert that word from the
left (zero inserts the previous command word).  Repeating this command
replaces the word just inserted with the last word from the
history event prior to the one just used; numeric arguments can be used in
the same way to pick a word from that event.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When called from a shell function invoked from a user-defined widget, the
command can take one to three arguments.  The first argument specifies a
history offset which applies to successive calls to this widget: if is -1,
the default behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive calls will move
forwards through the history.  The value 0 can be used to indicate that the
history line examined by the previous execution of the command will be
reexamined.  Note that negative numbers should be preceded with a
`<B>-</B><B>-</B>' argument to avoid confusing them with options.
<P>

If two arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the command
line in normal array index notation (as a more natural alternative to the
prefix argument).  Hence 1 is the first word, and -1 (the default) is the
last word.
<P>

If a third argument is given, its value is ignored, but it is used to
signify that the history offset is relative to the current history line,
rather than the one remembered after the previous invocations of
<B>insert-last-word</B>.
<P>

For example, the default behaviour of the command corresponds to
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle insert-last-word -- -1 -1</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

while the command
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle insert-last-word -- -1 1 -</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

always copies the first word of the line in the history immediately before
the line being edited.  This has the side effect that later invocations of
the widget will be relative to that line.
</DL>

<DT><B>vi-repeat-search</B> (unbound) (n) (unbound)<DD>
Repeat the last vi history search.
<DT><B>vi-rev-repeat-search</B> (unbound) (N) (unbound)<DD>

Changes the sign of the following argument.
<DT><B>universal-argument</B><DD>
Multiply the argument of the next command by 4.  Alternatively, if
this command is followed by an integer (positive or negative), use
that as the argument for the next command.  Thus digits cannot be

twice, followed immediately by <B>forward-char</B>, move forward sixteen
spaces; if instead it is followed by <B>-2</B>, then <B>forward-char</B>,
move backward two spaces.

Inside a widget function, if passed an argument, i.e. `<B>zle

<DT><B>push-input</B><DD>
Push the entire current multiline construct onto the buffer stack and
return to the top-level (<B>PS1</B>) prompt.
If the current parser construct is only a single line, this is exactly
like <B>push-line</B>.
Next time the editor starts up or is popped with <B>get-line</B>, the
construct will be popped off the top of the buffer stack and loaded
into the editing buffer.
<DT><B>push-line</B> (^Q ESC-Q ESC-q) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Push the current buffer onto the buffer stack and clear
the buffer.
Next time the editor starts up, the buffer will be popped
off the top of the buffer stack and loaded into the editing
buffer.
<DT><B>push-line-or-edit</B><DD>
At the top-level (<B>PS1</B>) prompt, equivalent to <B>push-line</B>.
At a secondary (<B>PS2</B>) prompt, move the entire current multiline
construct into the editor buffer.
The latter is equivalent to <B>push-input</B> followed by <B>get-line</B>.
<DT><B>recursive-edit</B><DD>
Only useful from a user-defined widget.  At this point in the function,
the editor regains control until one of the standard widgets which would
normally cause zle to exit (typically an <B>accept-line</B> caused by
hitting the return key) is executed.  Instead, control returns to the
user-defined widget.  The status returned is non-zero if the return was
caused by an error, but the function still continues executing and hence
may tidy up.  This makes it safe for the user-defined widget to alter
the command line or key bindings temporarily.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

The following widget, <B>caps-lock</B>, serves as an example.

This causes typed letters to be inserted capitalised until either
<B>accept-line</B> (i.e. typically the return key) is typed or the
<B>caps-lock</B> widget is invoked again; the later is handled by saving
the old definition of <B>caps-lock</B> as <B>save-caps-lock</B> and then
rebinding it to invoke <B>accept-line</B>.  Note that an error from the

Push the buffer onto the buffer stack, and execute the
command `<B>run-help</B> <I>cmd</I>', where <I>cmd</I> is the current
command.  <B>run-help</B> is normally aliased to <B>man</B>.
<DT><B>vi-set-buffer</B> (unbound) (&quot;) (unbound)<DD>
Specify a buffer to be used in the following command.
There are 35 buffers that can be specified:
the 26 `named' buffers <B>&quot;a</B> to <B>&quot;z</B>
and the nine `queued' buffers <B>&quot;1</B> to <B>&quot;9</B>.  The named buffers can also
be specified as <B>&quot;A</B> to <B>&quot;Z</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When a buffer is specified for a cut command, the text being cut replaces
the previous contents of the specified buffer.  If a named buffer
is specified using a capital, the newly cut text is appended to the buffer
instead of overwriting it.
<P>

If no buffer is specified for a cut command, <B>&quot;1</B> is used, and the
contents of <B>&quot;1</B> to <B>&quot;8</B> are each shifted along one buffer; the contents of
<B>&quot;9</B> is lost.
</DL>

<DT><B>vi-set-mark</B> (unbound) (m) (unbound)<DD>
Set the specified mark at the cursor position.
<DT><B>set-mark-command</B> (^@) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Set the mark at the cursor position.
<DT><B>spell-word</B> (ESC-$ ESC-S ESC-s) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Attempt spelling correction on the current word.
<DT><B>undefined-key</B><DD>
This command is executed when a key sequence that is not bound to any
command is typed.  By default it beeps.
<DT><B>undo</B> (^_ ^Xu ^X^U) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Incrementally undo the last text modification.
<DT><B>redo</B><DD>
Incrementally redo undone text modifications.
<DT><B>vi-undo-change</B> (unbound) (u) (unbound)<DD>

hexadecimal number, the current cursor position within the buffer and the
column of the cursor in the current line.
<DT><B>where-is</B><DD>
Read the name of an editor command and and print the listing of key
sequences that invoke the specified command.
<DT><B>which-command</B> (ESC-?) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Push the buffer onto the buffer stack, and execute the
command `<B>which-command</B> <I>cmd</I>'. where <I>cmd</I> is the current
command.  <B>which-command</B> is normally aliased to <I>whence</I>.
<DT><B>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line</B> (unbound) (0) (unbound)<DD>
If the last command executed was a digit as part of an argument,
continue the argument.  Otherwise, execute vi-beginning-of-line.

<H2>NAME</H2>

zshcompwid - zsh completion widgets

<A NAME="lbDZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The shell's programmable completion mechanism can be manipulated in two
ways; here the low-level features supporting the newer, function-based
mechanism are defined.  A complete set of shell functions based on these
features is described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompsys.1.php">zshcompsys</A></I>(1),
and users with no interest in adding to that system (or, potentially,
writing their own --- see dictionary entry for `hubris') should skip this
section.  The older system based on the <B>compctl</B> builtin command is
described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompctl.1.php">zshcompctl</A></I>(1).
<P>

Completion widgets are defined by the <B>-C</B> option to the <B>zle</B>
builtin command provided by the <B>zsh/zle</B> module (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1)). For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -C complete expand-or-complete completer</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

defines a widget named `<B>complete</B>'.  The second argument is the name
of any of the builtin widgets that handle completions:
<B>complete-word</B>, <B>expand-or-complete</B>,
<B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B>, <B>menu-complete</B>,
<B>menu-expand-or-complete</B>, <B>reverse-menu-complete</B>,
<B>list-choices</B>, or <B>delete-char-or-list</B>.  Note that this will still
work even if the widget in question has been re-bound.
<P>

When this newly defined widget is bound to a key
using the <B>bindkey</B> builtin command defined in the <B>zsh/zle</B> module
(see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1)), typing that key will call the shell function `<B>completer</B>'. This
function is responsible for generating the possible matches using the
builtins described below.  As with other ZLE widgets, the function is
called with its standard input closed.
<P>

Once the function returns, the completion code takes over control again
and treats the matches in the same manner as the specified builtin
widget, in this case <B>expand-or-complete</B>.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME="lbEA">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SPECIAL PARAMETERS</H2>

<P>

Inside completion widgets, and any functions called from them, some
parameters have special meaning; outside these functions they are not
special to the shell in any way.  These parameters are used to pass
information between the completion code and the completion widget. Some of
the builtin commands and the condition codes use or change the current
values of these parameters.  Any existing values will be hidden during
execution of completion widgets; except for <B>compstate</B>, the parameters
are reset on each function exit (including nested function calls from
within the completion widget) to the values they had when the function was
entered.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>CURRENT</B>
This is the number of the current word, i.e. the word the cursor is
currently on in the <B>words</B> array.  Note that this value is only
correct if the <B>ksharrays</B> option is not set.
<DT><B>IPREFIX</B><DD>
Initially this will be set to the empty string.  This parameter functions
like <B>PREFIX</B>; it contains a string which precedes the one in <B>PREFIX</B>
and is not considered part of the list of matches.  Typically, a string is
transferred from the beginning of <B>PREFIX</B> to the end of <B>IPREFIX</B>, for
example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>IPREFIX=${PREFIX%%\=*}=
PREFIX=${PREFIX#*=}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

causes the part of the prefix up to and including the first equal sign not
to be treated as part of a matched string.  This can be done automatically
by the <B>compset</B> builtin, see below.
</DL>

<DT><B>ISUFFIX</B><DD>
As <B>IPREFIX</B>, but for a suffix that should not be considered part
of the matches; note that the <B>ISUFFIX</B> string follows the <B>SUFFIX</B>
string.
<DT><B>PREFIX</B><DD>
Initially this will be set to the part of the current word from the
beginning of the word up to the position of the cursor; it may be altered
to give a common prefix for all matches.
<DT><B>QIPREFIX</B><DD>
This parameter is read-only and contains the quoted string up to the
word being completed. E.g. when completing `<B>&quot;foo</B>', this parameter
contains the double quote. If the <B>-q</B> option of <B>compset</B> is used 
(see below), and the original string was `<B>&quot;foo bar</B>' with the
cursor on the `<B>bar</B>', this parameter contains `<B>&quot;foo </B>'.
<DT><B>QISUFFIX</B><DD>
Like <B>QIPREFIX</B>, but containing the suffix.
<DT><B>SUFFIX</B><DD>
Initially this will be set to the part of the current word from the
cursor position to the end; it may be altered to give a common suffix for
all matches.  It is most useful when the option <B>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</B> is
set, as otherwise the whole word on the command line is treated as a
prefix.
<DT><B>compstate</B><DD>
This is an associative array with various keys and values that the
completion code uses to exchange information with the completion widget.
The keys are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>all_quotes</B>
The <B>-q</B> option of the <B>compset</B> builtin command (see below)
allows a quoted string to be broken into separate words; if the cursor is
on one of those words, that word will be completed, possibly invoking
`<B>compset -q</B>' recursively.  With this key it is possible to test the
types of quoted strings which are currently broken into parts in this
fashion.  Its value contains one character for each quoting level.  The
characters are a single quote or a double quote for strings quoted with
these characters and a backslash for strings not starting with a quote
character.  The first character in the value always corresponds to the
innermost quoting level.
<DT><B>context</B><DD>
This will be set by the completion code to the overall context
in which completion is attempted. Possible values are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>array_value</B>
when completing inside the value of an array parameter assignment; in
this case the <B>words</B> array contains the words inside the parentheses.
<DT><B>brace_parameter</B><DD>
when completing the name of a parameter in a parameter expansion beginning
with <B>${</B>.
<DT><B>assign_parameter</B><DD>
when completing the name of a parameter in a parameter assignment.
<DT><B>command</B><DD>
when completing for a normal command (either in command position or for
an argument of the command).
<DT><B>condition</B><DD>
when completing inside a `<B>[[</B>...<B>]]</B>' conditional expression; in
this case the <B>words</B> array contains only the words inside the
conditional expression.
<DT><B>math</B><DD>
when completing in a mathematical environment such as a
`<B>((</B>...<B>))</B>' construct.
<DT><B>parameter</B><DD>
when completing the name of a parameter in a parameter expansion beginning
with <B>$</B> but not <B>${</B>.
<DT><B>redirect</B><DD>
when completing after a redirection operator.
<DT><B>subscript</B><DD>
when completing inside a parameter subscript.
<DT><B>value</B><DD>
when completing the value of a parameter assignment.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>exact</B><DD>
Controls the behaviour when the <B>REC_EXACT</B> option is set.  It will be
set to <B>accept</B> if an exact match would be accepted, and will be unset
otherwise.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If it was set when at least one match equal to the string on the line
was generated, the match is accepted.
</DL>

<DT><B>exact_string</B><DD>
The string of an exact match if one was found, otherwise unset.
<DT><B>ignored</B><DD>
The number of words that were ignored because they matched one of the
patterns given with the <B>-F</B> option to the <B>compadd</B> builtin
command.
<DT><B>insert</B><DD>
This controls the manner in which a match is inserted into the command
line.  On entry to the widget function, if it is unset the command line is
not to be changed; if set to <B>unambiguous</B>, any prefix common to all
matches is to be inserted; if set to <B>automenu-unambiguous</B>, the
common prefix is to be inserted and the next invocation of the
completion code may start menu completion (due to the <B>AUTO_MENU</B>
option being set); if set to <B>menu</B> or <B>automenu</B> menu completion
will be started for the matches currently generated (in the
latter case this will happen because the <B>AUTO_MENU</B> is set). The
value may also contain the string `<B>tab</B>' when the completion code
would normally not really do completion, but only insert the TAB
character.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

On exit it may be set to any of the values above (where setting it to
the empty string is the same as unsetting it), or to a number, in which
case the match whose number is given will be inserted into the command line.
Negative numbers count backward from the last match (with `<B>-1</B>'
selecting the last match) and out-of-range values are wrapped
around, so that a value of zero selects the last match and a value
one more than the maximum selects the first. Unless the value of this
key ends in a space, the match is inserted as in a menu completion,
i.e. without automatically appending a space.
<P>

Both <B>menu</B> and <B>automenu</B> may also specify the the number of the
match to insert, given after a colon.  For example, `<B>menu:2</B>' says
to start menu completion, beginning with the second match.
<P>

Note that a value containing the substring `<B>tab</B>' makes the
matches generated be ignored and only the TAB be inserted.
<P>

Finally, it may also be set to <B>all</B>, which makes all matches
generated be inserted into the line.
</DL>

<DT><B>insert_positions</B><DD>
When the completion system inserts an unambiguous string into the
line, there may be multiple places where characters are missing or
where the character inserted differs from at least one match.  The
value of this key contains a colon separated list of all these
positions, as indexes into the command line.
<DT><B>last_prompt</B><DD>
If this is set to a non-empty string for every match added, the
completion code will move the cursor back to the previous prompt after
the list of completions has been displayed.  Initially this is set or
unset according to the <B>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</B> option.
<DT><B>list</B><DD>
This controls whether or how the list of matches will be displayed.  If it
is unset or empty they will never be listed; if its value begins with
<B>list</B>, they will always be listed; if it begins with <B>autolist</B>
or <B>ambiguous</B>, they will be listed when the <B>AUTO_LIST</B> or
<B>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</B> options respectively would normally cause them to
be.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the substring <B>force</B> appears in the value, this makes the
list be shown even if there is only one match. Normally, the list
would be shown only if there are at least two matches.
<P>

The value contains the substring <B>packed</B> if the <B>LIST_PACKED</B>
option is set. If this substring is given for all matches added to a
group, this group will show the <B>LIST_PACKED</B> behavior. The same is
done for the <B>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</B> option with the substring <B>rows</B>.
<P>

Finally, if the value contains the string <B>explanations</B>, only the
explanation strings, if any, will be listed and if it contains
<B>messages</B>, only the messages (added with the <B>-x</B> option of
<B>compadd</B>) will be listed.  If it contains both <B>explanations</B> and 
<B>messages</B> both kinds of explanation strings will be listed.  It
will be set appropriately on entry to a completion widget and may be
changed there.
</DL>

<DT><B>list_lines</B><DD>
This gives the number of lines that are needed to display the full
list of completions.  Note that to calculate the total number of lines
to display you need to add the number of lines needed for the command
line to this value, this is available as the value of the <B>BUFFERLINES</B>
special parameter.
<DT><B>list_max</B><DD>
Initially this is set to the value of the <B>LISTMAX</B> parameter.
It may be set to any other value; when the widget exits this value
will be used in the same way as the value of <B>LISTMAX</B>.
<DT><B>nmatches</B><DD>
The number of matches generated and accepted by the completion code so
far.
<DT><B>old_insert</B><DD>
On entry to the widget this will be set to the number of the match of
an old list of completions that is currently inserted into the command
line. If no match has been inserted, this is unset.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

As with <B>old_list</B>, the value of this key will only be used if it is the
string <B>keep</B>. If it was set to this value by the widget and there was an
old match inserted into the command line, this match will be kept and if
the value of the <B>insert</B> key specifies that another match should be
inserted, this will be inserted after the old one.
</DL>

<DT><B>old_list</B><DD>
This is set to <B>yes</B> if there is still a valid list of completions
from a previous completion at the time the widget is invoked.  This will
usually be the case if and only if the previous editing operation was a
completion widget or one of the builtin completion functions.  If there is a
valid list and it is also currently shown on the screen, the value of this
key is <B>shown</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

After the widget has exited the value of this key is only used if it
was set to <B>keep</B>.  In this case the completion code will continue
to use this old list.  If the widget generated new matches, they will
not be used.
</DL>

<DT><B>parameter</B><DD>
The name of the parameter when completing in a subscript or in the
value of a parameter assignment.
<DT><B>pattern_insert</B><DD>
Normally this is set to <B>menu</B>, which specifies that menu completion will
be used whenever a set of matches was generated using pattern matching.  If
it is set to any other non-empty string by the user and menu completion is
not selected by other option settings, the code will instead insert any
common prefix for the generated matches as with normal completion.
<DT><B>pattern_match</B><DD>
Locally controls the behaviour given by the <B>GLOB_COMPLETE</B> option.
Initially it is set to `<B>*</B>' if and only if the option is set.
The completion widget may set it to this value, to an empty string
(which has the same effect as unsetting it), or to any
other non-empty string.  If it is non-empty, unquoted metacharacters on the
command line will be treated as patterns; if it is `<B>*</B>', then
additionally a wildcard `<B>*</B>' is assumed at the cursor position; if
it is empty or unset, metacharacters will be treated literally.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that the matcher specifications given to the <B>compadd</B> builtin
command are not used if this is set to a non-empty string.
</DL>

<DT><B>quote</B><DD>
When completing inside quotes, this contains the quotation character
(i.e. either a single quote, a double quote, or a backtick).  Otherwise it
is unset.
<DT><B>quoting</B><DD>
When completing inside single quotes, this is set to the string
<B>single</B>; inside double quotes, the string
<B>double</B>; inside backticks, the string <B>backtick</B>.
Otherwise it is unset.
<DT><B>redirect</B><DD>
The redirection operator when completing in a redirection position,
i.e. one of <B>&lt;</B>, <B>&gt;</B>, etc.
<DT><B>restore</B><DD>
This is set to <B>auto</B> before a function is entered, which forces the
special parameters mentioned above (<B>words</B>, <B>CURRENT</B>, <B>PREFIX</B>,
<B>IPREFIX</B>, <B>SUFFIX</B>, and <B>ISUFFIX</B>) to be restored to their
previous values when the function exits.   If a function unsets it or
sets it to any other string, they will not be restored.
<DT><B>to_end</B><DD>
Specifies the occasions on which the cursor is moved to the end of a string
when a match is inserted.  On entry to a widget function, it may be
<B>single</B> if this will happen when a single unambiguous match was inserted
or <B>match</B> if it will happen any time a match is inserted (for example,
by menu completion; this is likely to be the effect of the <B>ALWAYS_TO_END</B>
option).
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

On exit, it may be set to <B>single</B> as above.  It may also be set to
<B>always</B>, or to the empty string or unset; in those cases the cursor will
be moved to the end of the string always or never respectively.  Any
other string is treated as <B>match</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>unambiguous</B><DD>
This key is read-only and will always be set to the common (unambiguous)
prefix the completion code has generated for all matches added so far.
<DT><B>unambiguous_cursor</B><DD>
This gives the position the cursor would be placed at if the
common prefix in the <B>unambiguous</B> key were inserted, relative to
the value of that key. The cursor would be placed before the character
whose index is given by this key.
<DT><B>unambiguous_positions</B><DD>
This contains all positions where characters in the unambiguous string
are missing or where the character inserted differs from at least one
of the matches.  The positions are given as indexes into the string
given by the value of the <B>unambiguous</B> key.
<DT><B>vared</B><DD>
If completion is called while editing a line using the <B>vared</B>
builtin, the value of this key is set to the name of the parameter
given as an argument to <B>vared</B>.  This key is only set while a <B>vared</B>
command is active.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>words</B><DD>
This array contains the words present on the command line currently being
edited.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This builtin command can be used to add matches directly and control
all the information the completion code stores with each possible
match. The return value is zero if at least one match was added and
non-zero if no matches were added.
<P>

The completion code breaks the string to complete into seven fields in
the order: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<I>&lt;ipre&gt;&lt;apre&gt;&lt;hpre&gt;&lt;word&gt;&lt;hsuf&gt;&lt;asuf&gt;&lt;isuf&gt;</I>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The first field
is an ignored prefix taken from the command line, the contents of the
<B>IPREFIX</B> parameter plus the string given with the <B>-i</B>
option. With the <B>-U</B> option, only the string from the <B>-i</B>
option is used. The field <I>&lt;apre&gt;</I> is an optional prefix string
given with the <B>-P</B> option.  The <I>&lt;hpre&gt;</I> field is a string
that is considered part of the match but that should not be shown when 
listing completions, given with the <B>-p</B> option; for example,
functions that do filename generation might specify
a common path prefix this way.  <I>&lt;word&gt;</I> is the part of the match that
should appear in the list of completions, i.e. one of the <I>words</I> given
at the end of the <B>compadd</B> command line. The suffixes <I>&lt;hsuf&gt;</I>,
<I>&lt;asuf&gt;</I> and <I>&lt;isuf&gt;</I> correspond to the prefixes <I>&lt;hpre&gt;</I>,
<I>&lt;apre&gt;</I> and <I>&lt;ipre&gt;</I> and are given by the options <B>-s</B>, <B>-S</B> and
<B>-I</B>, respectively.
<P>

The supported flags are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-P</B> <I>prefix</I>
This gives a string to be inserted before the given <I>words</I>.  The
string given is not considered as part of the match and any shell
metacharacters in it will not be quoted when the string is inserted.
<DT><B>-S</B> <I>suffix</I><DD>
Like <B>-P</B>, but gives a string to be inserted after the match.
<DT><B>-p</B> <I>hidden-prefix</I><DD>
This gives a string that should be inserted into the command line before the
match but that should not appear in the list of matches. Unless the
<B>-U</B> option is given, this string must be matched as part of the string
on the command line.
<DT><B>-s</B> <I>hidden-suffix</I><DD>
Like `<B>-p</B>', but gives a string to insert after the match.
<DT><B>-i</B> <I>ignored-prefix</I><DD>
This gives a string to insert into the command line just before any
string given with the `<B>-P</B>' option.  Without `<B>-P</B>' the string is
inserted before the string given with `<B>-p</B>' or directly before the
match.
<DT><B>-I</B> <I>ignored-suffix</I><DD>
Like <B>-i</B>, but gives an ignored suffix.
<DT><B>-a</B><DD>
With this flag the <I>words</I> are taken as names of arrays and the
possible matches are their values.  If only some elements of the
arrays are needed, the <I>words</I> may also contain subscripts, as in
`<B>foo[2,-1]</B>'.
<DT><B>-k</B><DD>
With this flag the <I>words</I> are taken as names of associative arrays
and the possible matches are their keys.  As for <B>-a</B>, the
<I>words</I> may also contain subscripts, as in `<B>foo[(R)*bar*]</B>'.
<DT><B>-d</B> <I>array</I><DD>
This adds per-match display strings. The <I>array</I> should contain one 
element per <I>word</I> given. The completion code will then display the 
first element instead of the first <I>word</I>, and so on. The
<I>array</I> may be given as the name of an array parameter or directly
as a space-separated list of words in parentheses.

If there are fewer display strings than <I>words</I>, the leftover
<I>words</I> will be displayed unchanged and if there are more display
strings than <I>words</I>, the leftover display strings will be silently
ignored.
</DL>

<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
This option only has an effect if used together with the <B>-d</B>
option. If it is given, the display strings are listed one per line,
not arrayed in columns.
<DT><B>-J</B> <I>name</I><DD>
Gives the name of the group of matches the words should be stored in.
<DT><B>-V</B> <I>name</I><DD>
Like <B>-J</B> but naming a unsorted group. These are in a different name 
space than groups created with the <B>-J</B> flag.
<DT><B>-1</B><DD>
If given together with the <B>-V</B> option, makes
only consecutive duplicates in the group be removed. If combined with
the <B>-J</B> option, this has no visible effect. Note that groups
with and without this flag are in different name spaces.
<DT><B>-2</B><DD>
If given together with the <B>-J</B> or <B>-V</B> option, makes all
duplicates be kept. Again, groups with and without this flag are in
different name spaces.
<DT><B>-X</B> <I>explanation</I><DD>
The <I>explanation</I> string will be printed with the list of matches,
above the group currently selected.
<DT><B>-x</B> <I>message</I><DD>
Like <B>-X</B>, but the <I>message</I> will be printed even if there are no 
matches in the group.
<DT><B>-q</B><DD>
The suffix given with <B>-S</B> will be automatically removed if 
the next character typed is a blank or does not insert anything, or if
the suffix consists of only one character and the next character typed 
is the same character.
<DT><B>-r</B> <I>remove-chars</I><DD>
This is a more versatile form of the <B>-q</B> option.
The suffix given with <B>-S</B> or the slash automatically added after
completing directories will be automatically removed if
the next character typed inserts one of the characters given in the
<I>remove-chars</I>.  This string is parsed as a characters class and
understands the backslash sequences used by the <B>print</B> command.  For
example, `<B>-r &quot;a-z\t&quot;</B>' removes the suffix if the next character typed
inserts a lowercase character or a TAB, and `<B>-r &quot;^0-9&quot;</B>' removes the
suffix if the next character typed inserts anything but a digit. One extra
backslash sequence is understood in this string: `<B>\-</B>' stands for
all characters that insert nothing. Thus `<B>-S &quot;=&quot; -q</B>' is the same
as `<B>-S &quot;=&quot; -r &quot;= \t\n\-&quot;</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This option may also be used without the <B>-S</B> option; then any
automatically added space will be removed when one of the characters in the
list is typed.
</DL>

<DT><B>-R</B> <I>remove-func</I><DD>
This is another form of the <B>-r</B> option. When a suffix 
has been inserted and the completion accepted, the function
<I>remove-func</I> will be called after the next character typed.  It is
passed the length of the suffix as an argument and can use the special
parameters available in ordinary (non-completion) zle widgets (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1)) to analyse and modify the command line.
<DT><B>-f</B><DD>
If this flag is given, all of the matches built from <I>words</I> are
marked as being the names of files.  They are not required to be actual
filenames, but if they are, and the option <B>LIST_TYPES</B> is set, the
characters describing the types of the files in the completion lists will
be shown. This also forces a slash to be added when the name of a
directory is completed.
<DT><B>-e</B><DD>
This flag can be used to tell the completion code that the matches
added are parameter names for a parameter expansion. This will make
the <B>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH</B> and <B>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS</B> options be used for
the matches.
<DT><B>-W</B> <I>file-prefix</I><DD>
This string is a pathname that will be
prepended to each of the matches formed by the given <I>words</I> together 
with any prefix specified by the <B>-p</B> option to form a complete filename
for testing.  Hence it is only useful if combined with the <B>-f</B> flag, as
the tests will not otherwise be performed.
<DT><B>-F</B> <I>array</I><DD>
Specifies an array containing patterns. Words matching one of these
patterns are ignored, i.e. not considered to be possible matches.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>array</I> may be the name of an array parameter or a list of
literal patterns enclosed in parentheses and quoted, as in `<B>-F &quot;(*?.o
*?.h)&quot;</B>'. If the name of an array is given, the elements of the array are
taken as the patterns.
</DL>

<DT><B>-Q</B><DD>
This flag instructs the completion 
code not to quote any metacharacters in the words when inserting them
into the command line.
<DT><B>-M</B> <I>match-spec</I><DD>
This gives local match specifications as described below in
the section `Matching Control'. This option may be given more than once. In 
this case all <I>match-spec</I>s given are concatenated with spaces
between them to form the specification string to use.
Note that they will only be used if the <B>-U</B> option is not given.
<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
Specifies that the words added are to be used as possible
matches, but are not to appear in the completion listing.
<DT><B>-U</B><DD>
If this flag is given, all words given will be accepted and no matching
will be done by the completion code. Normally this is used in
functions that do the matching themselves.
<DT><B>-O</B> <I>array</I><DD>
If this option is given, the <I>words</I> are <I>not</I> added to the set of
possible completions.  Instead, matching is done as usual and all of the
<I>words</I> given as arguments that match the string on the command line
will be stored in the array parameter whose name is given as <I>array</I>.
<DT><B>-A</B> <I>array</I><DD>
As the <B>-O</B> option, except that instead of those of the <I>words</I> which
match being stored in <I>array</I>, the strings generated internally by the
completion code are stored. For example,
with a matching specification of `<B>-M &quot;L:|no=&quot;</B>', the string `<B>nof</B>'
on the command line and the string `<B>foo</B>' as one of the <I>words</I>, this
option stores the string `<B>nofoo</B>' in the array, whereas the <B>-O</B>
option stores the `<B>foo</B>' originally given.
<DT><B>-D</B> <I>array</I><DD>
As with <B>-O</B>, the <I>words</I> are not added to the set of possible
completions.  Instead, the completion code tests whether each <I>word</I> 
in turn matches what is on the line.  If the <I>n</I>'th <I>word</I> does not
match, the <I>n</I>'th element of the <I>array</I> is removed.  Elements
for which the corresponding <I>word</I> is matched are retained.
<DT><B>-C</B><DD>
This option adds a special match which expands to all other matches
when inserted into the line, even those that are added after this
option is used.  Together with the <B>-d</B> option it is possible to
specify a string that should be displayed in the list for this special 
match.  If no string is given, it will be shown as a string containing 
the strings that would be inserted for the other matches, truncated to 
the width of the screen.
<DT><B>-E</B><DD>
This option adds <I>number</I> empty matches after the <I>words</I> have
been added.  An empty match takes up space in completion listings but
will never be inserted in the line and can't be selected with menu
completion or menu selection.  This makes empty matches only useful to
format completion lists and to make explanatory string be shown in
completion lists (since empty matches can be given display strings
with the <B>-d</B> option).  And because all but one empty string would
otherwise be removed, this option implies the <B>-V</B> and <B>-2</B>
options (even if an explicit <B>-J</B> option is given).
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-</B>

This flag ends the list of flags and options. All arguments after it
will be taken as the words to use as matches even if they begin with
hyphens.

Except for the <B>-M</B> flag, if any of these flags is given more than
once, the first one (and its argument) will be used.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-p</B> <I>number</I>
If the contents of the <B>PREFIX</B> parameter is longer than <I>number</I>
characters, the first <I>number</I> characters are removed from it and
appended to the contents of the <B>IPREFIX</B> parameter.
<DT><B>-P</B> [ <I>number</I> ] <I>pattern</I><DD>
If the value of the <B>PREFIX</B> parameter begins with anything that
matches the <I>pattern</I>, the matched portion is removed from
<B>PREFIX</B> and appended to <B>IPREFIX</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Without the optional <I>number</I>, the longest match is taken, but
if <I>number</I> is given, anything up to the <I>number</I>'th match is
moved.  If the <I>number</I> is negative, the <I>number</I>'th longest
match is moved. For example, if <B>PREFIX</B> contains the string
`<B>a=b=c</B>', then <B>compset -P '*\='</B> will move the string `<B>a=b=</B>' 
into the <B>IPREFIX</B> parameter, but <B>compset -P 1 '*\='</B> will move only
the string `<B>a=</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>-s</B> <I>number</I><DD>
As <B>-p</B>, but transfer the last <I>number</I> characters from the

<DT><B>-S</B> [ <I>number</I> ] <I>pattern</I><DD>
As <B>-P</B>, but match the last portion of <B>SUFFIX</B> and transfer the
matched portion to the front of the value of <B>ISUFFIX</B>.
<DT><B>-n</B> <I>begin</I> [ <I>end</I> ]<DD>
If the current word position as specified by the parameter <B>CURRENT</B> 
is greater than or equal to <I>begin</I>, anything up to the
<I>begin</I>'th word is removed from the <B>words</B> array and the value
of the parameter <B>CURRENT</B> is decremented by <I>begin</I>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the optional <I>end</I> is given, the modification is done only if
the current word position is also less than or equal to <I>end</I>. In
this case, the words from position <I>end</I> onwards are also removed from
the <B>words</B> array.
<P>

Both <I>begin</I> and <I>end</I> may be negative to count backwards
from the last element of the <B>words</B> array.
</DL>

<DT><B>-N</B> <I>beg-pat</I> [ <I>end-pat</I> ]<DD>
If one of the elements of the <B>words</B> array before the one at the
index given by the value of the parameter <B>CURRENT</B> matches the
pattern <I>beg-pat</I>, all elements up to and including the matching one are
removed from the <B>words</B> array and the value of <B>CURRENT</B> is changed to
point to the same word in the changed array.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the optional pattern <I>end-pat</I> is also given, and there is an
element in the <B>words</B> array matching this pattern, the parameters
are modified only if the index of this word is higher than the one
given by the <B>CURRENT</B> parameter (so that the matching word has 
to be after the cursor). In this case, the words starting with the one
matching <B>end-pat</B> are also removed from the <B>words</B>
array. If <B>words</B> contains no word matching <I>end-pat</I>, the
testing and modification is performed as if it were not given.
</DL>

<DT><B>-q</B><DD>
The word
currently being completed is split on spaces into separate words,
respecting the usual shell quoting conventions.  The 
resulting words are stored in the <B>words</B> array, and <B>CURRENT</B>,
<B>PREFIX</B>, <B>SUFFIX</B>, <B>QIPREFIX</B>, and <B>QISUFFIX</B> are modified to
reflect the word part that is completed.
</DL>
<P>

In all the above cases the return value is zero if the test succeeded
and the parameters were modified and non-zero otherwise. This allows
one to use this builtin in tests such as:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>if compset -P '*\='; then ...</B>

</DL>

<P>

This forces anything up to and including the last equal sign to be
ignored by the completion code.
</DL>

<DT><B>compcall</B> [ <B>-TD</B> ]<DD>
This allows the use of completions defined with the <B>compctl</B> builtin
from within completion widgets.  The list of matches will be generated as
if one of the non-widget completion function (<B>complete-word</B>, etc.)
had been called, except that only <B>compctl</B>s given for specific commands
are used. To force the code to try completions defined with the <B>-T</B>
option of <B>compctl</B> and/or the default completion (whether defined by
<B>compctl -D</B> or the builtin default) in the appropriate places, the
<B>-T</B> and/or <B>-D</B> flags can be passed to <B>compcall</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The return value can be used to test if a matching <B>compctl</B>
definition was found. It is non-zero if a <B>compctl</B> was found and

<H2>MATCHING CONTROL</H2>

<P>

It is possible by use of the
<B>-M</B> option of the <B>compadd</B> builtin command to specify how the
characters in the string to be completed (referred to here as the
command line) map onto the characters in the list of matches produced by
the completion code (referred to here as the trial completions). Note
that this is not used if the command line contains a glob pattern and
the <B>GLOB_COMPLETE</B> option is set or the <B>pattern_match</B> of the
<B>compstate</B> special association is set to a non-empty string.
<P>

The <I>match-spec</I> given as the argument to the <B>-M</B> option (see
`Builtin Commands' above) consists of one or more matching descriptions separated by
whitespace.  Each description consists of a letter followed by a colon
and then the patterns describing which character sequences on the line match
which character sequences in the trial completion.  Any sequence of
characters not handled in this fashion must match exactly, as usual.
<P>

The forms of <I>match-spec</I> understood are as follows. In each case, the
form with an uppercase initial character retains the string already
typed on the command line as the final result of completion, while with
a lowercase initial character the string on the command line is changed
into the corresponding part of the trial completion.

These letters are for patterns that are anchored by another pattern on
the left side. Matching for <I>lpat</I> and <I>tpat</I> is as for <B>m</B> and
<B>M</B>, but the pattern <I>lpat</I> matched on the command line must be
preceded by the pattern <I>lanchor</I>.  The <I>lanchor</I> can be blank to
anchor the match to the start of the command line string; otherwise the
anchor can occur anywhere, but must match in both the command line and
trial completion strings.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If no <I>lpat</I> is given but a <I>ranchor</I> is, this matches the gap
between substrings matched by <I>lanchor</I> and <I>ranchor</I>. Unlike
<I>lanchor</I>, the <I>ranchor</I> only needs to match the trial
completion string.
<P>

The <B>b</B> and <B>B</B> forms are similar to <B>l</B> and <B>L</B> with an empty 
anchor, but need to match only the beginning of the trial completion
or the word on the command line, respectively.

line and trial completion patterns are anchored on the right side.
Here an empty <I>ranchor</I> and the <B>e</B> and <B>E</B> forms force the
match to the end of the trial completion or command line string.
</DL>
<P>

Each <I>lpat</I>, <I>tpat</I> or <I>anchor</I> is either an empty string or
consists of a sequence of literal characters (which may be quoted with a
backslash), question marks, character classes, and correspondence
classes; ordinary shell patterns are not used.  Literal characters match
only themselves, question marks match any character, and character
classes are formed as for globbing and match any character in the given
set.
<P>

Correspondence classes are defined like character classes, but with two
differences: they are delimited by a pair of braces, and negated classes
are not allowed, so the characters <B>!</B> and <B>^</B> have no special
meaning directly after the opening brace.  They indicate that a range of
characters on the line match a range of characters in the trial
completion, but (unlike ordinary character classes) paired according to
the corresponding position in the sequence. For example, to make any
lowercase letter on the line match the corresponding uppercase letter in
the trial completion, you can use `<B>m:{a-z}={A-Z}</B>'.  More than one
pair of classes can occur, in which case the first class before the
<B>=</B> corresponds to the first after it, and so on.  If one side has
more such classes than the other side, the superfluous classes behave
like normal character classes.  In anchor patterns correspondence classes
also behave like normal character classes.
<P>

The pattern <I>tpat</I> may also be one or two stars, `<B>*</B>' or
`<B>**</B>'. This means that the pattern on the command line can match
any number of characters in the trial completion. In this case the
pattern must be anchored (on either side); in the case of a single
star, the <I>anchor</I> then determines how much of the trial completion
is to be included --- only the characters up to the next appearance of
the anchor will be matched. With two stars, substrings matched by the
anchor can be matched, too.
<P>

Examples:
<P>

The keys of the <B>options</B> association defined by the <B>parameter</B>
module are the option names in all-lowercase form, without
underscores, and without the optional <B>no</B> at the beginning even
though the builtins <B>setopt</B> and <B>unsetopt</B> understand option names
with uppercase letters, underscores, and the optional <B>no</B>.  The
following alters the matching rules so that the prefix <B>no</B> and any
underscore are ignored when trying to match the trial completions
generated and uppercase letters on the line match the corresponding
lowercase letters in the words:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compadd -M 'L:|[nN][oO]= M:_= M:{A-Z}={a-z}' - \ 
  ${(k)options} </B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The first part says that the pattern `<B>[nN][oO]</B>' at the beginning
(the empty anchor before the pipe symbol) of the string on the
line matches the empty string in the list of words generated by
completion, so it will be ignored if present. The second part does the
same for an underscore anywhere in the command line string, and the
third part uses correspondence classes so that any
uppercase letter on the line matches the corresponding lowercase
letter in the word. The use of the uppercase forms of the
specification characters (<B>L</B> and <B>M</B>) guarantees that what has
already been typed on the command line (in particular the prefix
<B>no</B>) will not be deleted.
<P>

Note that the use of <B>L</B> in the first part means that it matches
only when at the beginning of both the command line string and the
trial completion. I.e., the string `<B>_NO_f</B>' would not be
completed to `<B>_NO_foo</B>', nor would `<B>NONO_f</B>' be completed to
`<B>NONO_foo</B>' because of the leading underscore or the second
`<B>NO</B>' on the line which makes the pattern fail even though they are 
otherwise ignored. To fix this, one would use `<B>B:[nN][oO]=</B>'
instead of the first part. As described above, this matches at the
beginning of the trial completion, independent of other characters or
substrings at the beginning of the command line word which are ignored
by the same or other <I>match-spec</I>s.
<P>

The second example makes completion case insensitive.  This is just
the same as in the option example, except here we wish to retain the
characters in the list of completions:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compadd -M 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}' ... </B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This makes lowercase letters match their uppercase counterparts.
To make uppercase letters match the lowercase forms as well:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compadd -M 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}' ... </B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

A nice example for the use of <B>*</B> patterns is partial word
completion. Sometimes you would like to make strings like `<B>c.s.u</B>'
complete to strings like `<B>comp.source.unix</B>', i.e. the word on the
command line consists of multiple parts, separated by a dot in this
example, where each part should be completed separately --- note,
however, that the case where each part of the word, i.e. `<B>comp</B>',
`<B>source</B>' and `<B>unix</B>' in this example, is to be completed from
separate sets of matches
is a different problem to be solved by the implementation of the
completion widget.  The example can be handled by:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compadd -M 'r:|.=* r:|=*' \ 
  - comp.sources.unix comp.sources.misc ...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The first specification says that <I>lpat</I> is the empty string, while
<I>anchor</I> is a dot; <I>tpat</I> is <B>*</B>, so this can match anything
except for the `<B>.</B>' from the anchor in
the trial completion word.  So in `<B>c.s.u</B>', the matcher sees `<B>c</B>',
followed by the empty string, followed by the anchor `<B>.</B>', and
likewise for the second dot, and replaces the empty strings before the
anchors, giving `<B>c</B>[<B>omp</B>]<B>.s</B>[<B>ources</B>]<B>.u</B>[<B>nix</B>]', where
the last part of the completion is just as normal.
<P>

With the pattern shown above, the string `<B>c.u</B>' could not be
completed to `<B>comp.sources.unix</B>' because the single star means
that no dot (matched by the anchor) can be skipped. By using two stars 
as in `<B>r:|.=**</B>', however, `<B>c.u</B>' could be completed to
`<B>comp.sources.unix</B>'. This also shows that in some cases,
especially if the anchor is a real pattern, like a character class,
the form with two stars may result in more matches than one would like.
<P>

The second specification is needed to make this work when the cursor is
in the middle of the string on the command line and the option
<B>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</B> is set. In this case the completion code would
normally try to match trial completions that end with the string as
typed so far, i.e. it will only insert new characters at the cursor
position rather then at the end.  However in our example we would like
the code to recognise matches which contain extra characters after the
string on the line (the `<B>nix</B>' in the example).  Hence we say that the
empty string at the end of the string on the line matches any characters
at the end of the trial completion.
<P>

More generally, the specification
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compadd -M 'r:|[.,_-]=* r:|=*' ... </B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

allows one to complete words with abbreviations before any of the
characters in the square brackets.  For example, to
complete <B>veryverylongfile.c</B> rather than <B>veryverylongheader.h</B>
with the above in effect, you can just type <B>very.c</B> before attempting
completion.
<P>

The specifications with both a left and a right anchor are useful to
complete partial words whose parts are not separated by some
special character. For example, in some places strings have to be
completed that are formed `<B>LikeThis</B>' (i.e. the separate parts are
determined by a leading uppercase letter) or maybe one has to
complete strings with trailing numbers. Here one could use the simple
form with only one anchor as in:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compadd -M 'r:|[A-Z0-9]=* r:|=*' LikeTHIS FooHoo 5foo123 5bar234</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

But with this, the string `<B>H</B>' would neither complete to `<B>FooHoo</B>'
nor to `<B>LikeTHIS</B>' because in each case there is an uppercase
letter before the `<B>H</B>' and that is matched by the anchor. Likewise, 
a `<B>2</B>' would not be completed. In both cases this could be changed
by using `<B>r:|[A-Z0-9]=**</B>', but then `<B>H</B>' completes to both
`<B>LikeTHIS</B>' and `<B>FooHoo</B>' and a `<B>2</B>' matches the other
strings because characters can be inserted before every uppercase
letter and digit. To avoid this one would use:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compadd -M 'r:[^A-Z0-9]||[A-Z0-9]=** r:|=*' \ 
    LikeTHIS FooHoo foo123 bar234</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

By using these two anchors, a `<B>H</B>' matches only uppercase `<B>H</B>'s that 
are immediately preceded by something matching the left anchor
`<B>[^A-Z0-9]</B>'. The effect is, of course, that `<B>H</B>' matches only
the string `<B>FooHoo</B>', a `<B>2</B>' matches only `<B>bar234</B>' and so on.
<P>

When using the completion system (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompsys.1.php">zshcompsys</A></I>(1)), users can define match specifications that are to be used for
specific contexts by using the <B>matcher</B> and <B>matcher-list</B>
styles. The values for the latter will be used everywhere.
<P>

<H2>COMPLETION WIDGET EXAMPLE</H2>

<P>

The first step is to define the widget:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -C complete complete-word complete-files</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Then the widget can be bound to a key using the <B>bindkey</B> builtin
command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey '^X\t' complete</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

After that the shell function <B>complete-files</B> will be invoked
after typing control-X and TAB. The function should then generate the
matches, e.g.:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>complete-files () { compadd - * }</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This function will complete files in the current directory matching the 
current word.


<A NAME="lbEF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

zshcompsys - zsh completion system

<A NAME="lbEG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This describes the shell code for the new completion system.  It consists
of various shell functions; those beginning `<B>comp</B>' are to be called
directly, while those beginning `<B>_</B>' are called by the
completion code.  The shell functions of the second set, which implement
completion behaviour and may be bound to keystrokes, are referred to
as `widgets'.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME="lbEH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2>

<P>

If the system was installed completely, it should be enough to
call the shell function <B>compinit</B> from your initialization file; see the
next section.  However, the function <B>compinstall</B> can be run by a user
to configure various aspects of the completion system.
<P>

Usually, <B>compinstall</B> will insert code into <B>.zshrc</B>, although if
that is not writable it will save it in another file and tell you that
file's location.  Note that it is up to you to make sure that the lines
added to <B>.zshrc</B> are actually run; you may, for example, need to move
them to an earlier place in the file if <B>.zshrc</B> usually returns early.
So long as you keep them all together (including the comment lines at the
start and finish), you can rerun <B>compinstall</B> and it will correctly
locate and modify these lines.  Note, however, that any code you add to
this section by hand is likely to be lost if you rerun <B>compinstall</B>,
although lines using the command `<B>zstyle</B>' should be gracefully handled.
<P>

The new code will take effect next time you start the shell, or run
<B>.zshrc</B> by hand; there is also an option to make them take effect
immediately.  However, if <B>compinstall</B> has removed definitions, you will
need to restart the shell to see the changes.
<P>

To run <B>compinstall</B> you will need to make sure it is in a directory
mentioned in your <B>fpath</B> parameter, which should already be the case if
zsh was properly configured as long as your startup files do not remove the
appropriate directories from <B>fpath</B>.  Then it must be autoloaded
(`<B>autoload -U compinstall</B>' is recommended).  You can abort the
installation any time you are being prompted for information, and your
<B>.zshrc</B> will not be altered at all; changes only take place right at the
end, where you are specifically asked for confirmation.
<P>

<A NAME="lbEI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Use of compinit</H3>

<P>

This section describes the use of <B>compinit</B> to initialize completion for
the current session when called directly; if you have run
<B>compinstall</B> it will be called automatically from your <B>.zshrc</B>.
<P>

To initialize the system, the function <B>compinit</B> should be in a
directory mentioned in the <B>fpath</B> parameter, and should be autoloaded
(`<B>autoload -U compinit</B>' is recommended), and then run simply as
`<B>compinit</B>'.  This will define a
few utility functions, arrange for all the necessary shell functions to be
autoloaded, and will then re-define all widgets that do completion to use the
new system.  If you use the <B>menu-select</B> widget, which is part of the
<B>zsh/complist</B> module, you should make sure that that module is loaded
before the call to <B>compinit</B> so that that widget is also
re-defined.  If completion styles (see below) are set up to perform
expansion as well as completion by default, and the TAB key is bound to
<B>expand-or-complete</B>, <B>compinit</B> will rebind it to <B>complete-word</B>;
this is necessary to use the correct form of expansion.
<P>

Should you need to use the original completion commands, you can still
bind keys to the old widgets by putting a `<B>.</B>' in front of the
widget name, e.g. `<B>.expand-or-complete</B>'.
<P>

To speed up the running of <B>compinit</B>, it can be made to produce a dumped
configuration that will be read in on future invocations; this is the
default, but can be turned off by calling <B>compinit</B> with the
option <B>-D</B>.  The dumped file is <B>.zcompdump</B> in the same
directory as the startup files (i.e. <B>$ZDOTDIR</B> or <B>$HOME</B>);
alternatively, an explicit file name can be given by `<B>compinit -d</B>
<I>dumpfile</I>'.  The next invocation of <B>compinit</B> will read the dumped
file instead of performing a full initialization.
<P>

If the number of completion files changes, <B>compinit</B> will recognise this
and produce a new dump file.  However, if the name of a function or the
arguments in the first line of a <B>#compdef</B> function (as described below)
change, it is easiest to delete the dump file by hand so that
<B>compinit</B> will re-create it the next time it is run.  The check
performed to see if there are new functions can be omitted by giving
the option <B>-C</B>.  In this case the dump file will only be created if
there isn't one already.
<P>

The dumping is actually done by another function, <B>compdump</B>, but you
will only need to run this yourself if you change the configuration
(e.g. using <B>compdef</B>) and then want to dump the new one.  The name of
the old dumped file will be remembered for this purpose.
<P>

If the parameter <B>_compdir</B> is set, <B>compinit</B> uses it as a directory
where completion functions can be found; this is only necessary if they are
not already in the function search path.
<P>

For security reasons <B>compinit</B> also checks if the completion system
would use files not owned by root or by the current user, or files in
directories that are world- or group-writable or that are not owned by 
root or by the current user.  If such files or directories are found,
<B>compinit</B> will ask if the completion system should really be used.  To
avoid these tests and make all files found be used without asking, use the
option <B>-u</B>, and to make <B>compinit</B> silently ignore all insecure files
and directories use the option <B>-i</B>.  This security check is skipped
entirely when the <B>-C</B> option is given.
<P>

The security check can be retried at any time by running the function
<B>compaudit</B>.  This is the same check used by <B>compinit</B>, but when it
is executed directly any changes to <B>fpath</B> are made local to the
function so they do not persist.  The directories to be checked may be
passed as arguments; if none are given, <B>compaudit</B> uses <B>fpath</B> and
<B>_compdir</B> to find completion system directories, adding missing ones
to <B>fpath</B> as necessary.  To force a check of exactly the directories
currently named in <B>fpath</B>, set <B>_compdir</B> to an empty string before
calling <B>compaudit</B> or <B>compinit</B>.
<P>

<A NAME="lbEJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Autoloaded files</H3>

<P>

The convention for autoloaded functions used in completion is that they
start with an underscore; as already mentioned, the <B>fpath/FPATH</B>
parameter must contain the directory in which they are stored.  If <B>zsh</B>
was properly installed on your system, then <B>fpath/FPATH</B> automatically
contains the required directories for the standard functions.
<P>

For incomplete installations, if <B>compinit</B> does not find enough files
beginning with an underscore (fewer than twenty) in the search path, it
will try to find more by adding the directory <B>_compdir</B> to the search
path.  If that directory has a subdirectory named <B>Base</B>, all
subdirectories will be added to the path.  Furthermore, if the subdirectory
<B>Base</B> has a subdirectory named <B>Core</B>, <B>compinit</B> will add all
subdirectories of the subdirectories is to the path: this allows
the functions to be in the same format as in the <B>zsh</B> source
distribution.
<P>

When <B>compinit</B> is run, it searches all such files accessible via
<B>fpath/FPATH</B> and reads the first line of each of them.  This line should
contain one of the tags described below.  Files whose first line does not
start with one of these tags are not considered to be part of the
completion system and will not be treated specially.
<P>

The tags are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>#compdef</B> <I>names...</I> [ <B>-[pP]</B> <I>patterns...</I> [ <B>-N</B> <I>names...</I> ] ]
The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined 
in it will be called when completing <I>names</I>, each of which is
either the name of a command whose arguments are to be completed or one of
a number of special contexts in the form <B>-</B><I>context</I><B>-</B> described
below.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Each <I>name</I> may also be of the form `<I>cmd</I><B>=</B><I>service</I>'.
When completing the command <I>cmd</I>, the function typically behaves as
if the command (or special context) <I>service</I> was being completed
instead.  This provides a way of altering the behaviour of functions
that can perform many different completions.  It is implemented
by setting the parameter <B>$service</B> when calling the function;
the function may choose to interpret this how it wishes, and simpler
functions will probably ignore it.
<P>

If the <B>#compdef</B> line contains one of the options <B>-p</B> or <B>-P</B>,
the words following are taken to be patterns.  The function will be
called when completion is attempted for a command or context that matches
one of the patterns.  The options <B>-p</B> and <B>-P</B> are used to specify
patterns to be tried before or after other completions respectively.
Hence <B>-P</B> may be used to specify default actions.
<P>

The option <B>-N</B> is used after a list following <B>-p</B> or <B>-P</B>; it
specifies that remaining words no longer define patterns.  It is
possible to toggle between the three options as many times as necessary.
</DL>

<DT><B>#compdef -k</B> <I>style key-sequences...</I><DD>
This option creates a widget behaving like the
builtin widget <I>style</I> and binds it to the given <I>key-sequences</I>,
if any.  The <I>style</I> must be one of the builtin widgets that perform
completion, namely <B>complete-word</B>, <B>delete-char-or-list</B>,
<B>expand-or-complete</B>, <B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B>, <B>list-choices</B>,
<B>menu-complete</B>, <B>menu-expand-or-complete</B>, or
<B>reverse-menu-complete</B>.  If the <B>zsh/complist</B> module is loaded (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)) the widget <B>menu-select</B> is also available.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When one of the <I>key-sequences</I> is typed, the function in the file will
be invoked to generate the matches.  Note that a key will not be re-bound
if if it already was (that is, was bound to something other than
<B>undefined-key</B>).  The widget created has the same name as the file and
can be bound to any other keys using <B>bindkey</B> as usual.
</DL>

<DT><B>#compdef -K</B> <I>widget-name</I> <I>style</I> <I>key-sequences</I> ...<DD>
This is similar to <B>-k</B> except that only one <I>key-sequences</I>
argument may be given for each <I>widget-name</I> <I>style</I> pair.
However, the entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a
different set of arguments.  Note in particular that the
<I>widget-name</I> must be distinct in each set.  If it does not begin with
`<B>_</B>' this will be added.  The <I>widget-name</I> should not clash with
the name of any existing widget: names based on the name of the function
are most useful.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>#compdef -K _foo_complete complete-word &quot;^X^C&quot; \ 
  _foo_list list-choices &quot;^X^D&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

(all on one line) defines a widget <B>_foo_complete</B> for completion, bound
to `<B>^X^C</B>', and a widget <B>_foo_list</B> for listing, bound to `<B>^X^D</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>#autoload</B> [ <I>options</I> ]<DD>
Functions with the <B>#autoload</B> tag are marked for autoloading but
are not otherwise treated specially.  Typically they are to be called
from within one of the completion functions.  Any <I>options</I> supplied
will be passed to the <B>autoload</B> builtin; a typical use is <B>+X</B> to
force the function to be loaded immediately.  Note that the <B>-U</B> flag is
always added implicitly.
</DL>
<P>

The <B>#</B> is part of the tag name and no white space is allowed after it.
The <B>#compdef</B> tags use the <B>compdef</B> function described below; the
main difference is that the name of the function is supplied implicitly.
<P>

Note also that the functions for the completion system assume that the
<B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B> option is not set.  They cannot be loaded if it is
set.  To avoid having to unset <B>KSH_AUTOLOAD</B>, you can instead use one or
more <B>zwc</B> file(s) that have been created with the command <B>zcompile
-z</B> to load the functions for the completion system; see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshbuiltins.1.php">zshbuiltins</A></I>(1).  This forces the functions to be autoloaded the way zsh normally
loads functions.
<P>

The special contexts for which completion functions can be defined are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-array-value-</B>
The right hand side of an array-assignment
(`<B>foo=(...)</B>')
<DT><B>-brace-parameter-</B><DD>
The name of a parameter expansion within braces (`<B>${...}</B>')
<DT><B>-assign-parameter-</B><DD>
The name of a parameter in an assignment, i.e. on the left hand side of
an `<B>=</B>'
<DT><B>-command-</B><DD>
A word in command position
<DT><B>-condition-</B><DD>
A word inside a condition (`<B>[[...]]</B>')
<DT><B>-default-</B><DD>
Any word for which no other completion is defined
<DT><B>-equal-</B><DD>
A word beginning with an equals sign
<DT><B>-first-</B><DD>
This is tried before any other completion function.  The function called
may set the <B>_compskip</B> parameter to one of various values: 
<B>all</B>: no further completion is attempted; a string
containing the substring <B>patterns</B>: no pattern completion functions
will be called; a string containing <B>default</B>: the
function for the `<B>-default-</B>' context will not be called, but
functions defined for commands will
<DT><B>-math-</B><DD>
Inside mathematical contexts, such as
`<B>((</B>...<B>))</B>'
<DT><B>-parameter-</B><DD>
The name of a parameter expansion (`<B>$...</B>')
<DT><B>-redirect-</B><DD>
The word after a redirection operator.
<DT><B>-subscript-</B><DD>
The contents of a parameter subscript.
<DT><B>-tilde-</B><DD>
After an initial tilde (`<B>~</B>'), but before the first slash
in the word.
<DT><B>-value-</B><DD>
On the right hand side of an assignment.
</DL>
<P>

Default implementations are supplied for each of these
contexts.  In most cases the context <B>-</B><I>context</I><B>-</B> is
implemented by a corresponding function <B>_</B><I>context</I>, for example
the context `<B>-tilde-</B>' and the function `<B>_tilde</B>').
<P>

The contexts <B>-redirect-</B> and <B>-value-</B> allow extra context-specific
information.  (Internally, this is handled by the functions for each
context calling the function <B>_dispatch</B>.)  The extra
information is added separated by commas.
<P>

For the <B>-redirect-</B> context, the extra information is in the form
`<B>-redirect-,</B><I>op</I><B>,</B><I>command</I>', where <I>op</I> is the
redirection operator and <I>command</I> is the name of the command on
the line.  If there is no command on the line yet, the <I>command</I>
field will be empty.
<P>

For the <B>-value-</B> context, the form is
`<B>-value-,</B><I>name</I><B>,</B><I>command</I>', where <I>name</I> is the name of
the parameter.  In the case of elements of an associative array, for
example `<B>assoc=(key &lt;TAB&gt;</B>', <I>name</I> is expanded to
`<I>name</I><B>-</B><I>key</I>'.  In certain special contexts, such as
completing after `<B>make CFLAGS=</B>', the <I>command</I> part gives the
name of the command, here <B>make</B>; otherwise it is empty.
<P>

It is not necessary to define fully specific completions as the
functions provided will try to generate completions by progressively
replacing the elements with `<B>-default-</B>'.  For example, when
completing after `<B>foo=&lt;TAB&gt;</B>', <B>_value</B> will try the names
`<B>-value-,foo,</B>' (note the empty <I>command</I> part),
`<B>-value-,foo,-default-</B>' and`<B>-value-,-default-,-default-</B>', in
that order, until it finds a function to handle the context.
<P>

As an example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compdef '_files -g &quot;*.log&quot;' '-redirect-,2&gt;,-default-'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

completes files matching `<B>*.log</B>' after `<B>2&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</B>' for any
command with no more specific handler defined.
<P>

Also:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compdef _foo -value-,-default-,-default-</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

specifies that <B>_foo</B> provides completions for the values of
parameters for which no special function has been defined.  This is
usually handled by the function <B>_value</B> itself.
<P>

The same lookup rules are used when looking up styles (as described
below); for example
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:-redirect-,2&gt;,*:*' file-patterns '*.log'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

is another way to make completion after `<B>2&gt; &lt;TAB&gt;</B>' complete files
matching `<B>*.log</B>'.
<P>

<A NAME="lbEK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Functions</H3>

<P>

The following function is defined by <B>compinit</B> and may be called
directly.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>compdef</B> [ <B>-an</B> ] <I>function names...</I> [ <B>-[pP]</B> <I>patterns...</I> [ <B>-N</B> <I>names...</I> ] ]
<DT>

<B>compdef -d</B> <I>names...</I>

<B>compdef -k</B> [ <B>-an</B> ] <I>function style key-sequences...</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>compdef -K</B> [ <B>-an</B> ] <I>function name style key-sequences ...</I>
The first form defines the <I>function</I> to call for completion in the
given contexts as described for the <B>#compdef</B> tag above.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Alternatively, all the arguments may have the form
`<I>cmd</I><B>=</B><I>service</I>'.  Here <I>service</I> should already have been
defined by `<I>cmd1</I><B>=</B><I>service</I>' lines in <B>#compdef</B> files, as
described above.  The argument for <I>cmd</I> will be completed in the
same way as <I>service</I>.
<P>

The <I>function</I> argument may alternatively be a string containing any
shell code.  The string will be executed using the <B>eval</B> builtin
command to generate completions.  This provides a way of avoiding having
to define a new completion function.  For example, to complete
files ending in `<B>.h</B>' as arguments to the command <B>foo</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compdef '_files -g &quot;*.h&quot;' foo</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The option <B>-n</B> prevents any completions already defined for the
command or context from being overwritten.
<P>

The option <B>-d</B> deletes any completion defined for the command or
contexts listed.
<P>

The <I>names</I> may also contain <B>-p</B>, <B>-P</B> and <B>-N</B> options as
described for the <B>#compdef</B> tag.  The effect on the argument list is
identical, switching between definitions of patterns tried initially,
patterns tried finally, and normal commands and contexts.
<P>

The parameter <B>$_compskip</B> may be set by any function defined for a
pattern context.  If it is set to a value containing the substring
`<B>patterns</B>' none of the pattern-functions will be called; if it is
set to a value containing the substring `<B>all</B>', no other function
will be called.
<P>

The form with <B>-k</B> defines a widget with the same name as the <I>function</I>
that will be called for each of the <I>key-sequences</I>; this is like the
<B>#compdef -k</B> tag.  The function should generate the completions needed
and will otherwise behave like the builtin widget whose name is given as
the <I>style</I> argument.  The widgets usable for this are:
<B>complete-word</B>, <B>delete-char-or-list</B>, <B>expand-or-complete</B>,
<B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B>, <B>list-choices</B>, <B>menu-complete</B>,
<B>menu-expand-or-complete</B>, and <B>reverse-menu-complete</B>, as well as
<B>menu-select</B> if the <B>zsh/complist</B> module is loaded.  The option <B>-n</B>
prevents the key being bound if it is already to bound to something other
than <B>undefined-key</B>.
<P>

The form with <B>-K</B> is similar and defines multiple widgets based on the
same <I>function</I>, each of which requires the set of three arguments
<I>name</I>, <I>style</I> and <I>key-sequences</I>, where the latter two are as
for <B>-k</B> and the first must be a unique widget name beginning with an
underscore.
<P>

Wherever applicable, the <B>-a</B> option makes the <I>function</I>
autoloadable, equivalent to <B>autoload -U </B><I>function</I>.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

The function <B>compdef</B> can be used to associate existing completion
functions with new commands.  For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compdef _pids foo</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

uses the function <B>_pids</B> to complete process IDs for the command <B>foo</B>.
<P>

Note also the <B>_gnu_generic</B> function described below, which can be
used to complete options for commands that understand the
`<B>-</B><B>-help</B>' option.

<H2>COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION</H2>

<P>

This section gives a short overview of how the completion system works,
and then more detail on how users can configure how and when matches are
generated.
<P>

<A NAME="lbEM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>

When completion is attempted somewhere on the command line the
completion system first works out the context.  This takes account of a
number of things including the command word (such as `<B>grep</B>' or
`<B>zsh</B>') and options to which the current word may be an argument
(such as the `<B>-o</B>' option to <B>zsh</B> which takes a shell option as an
argument).
<P>

This context information is condensed into a string consisting of
multiple fields separated by colons, referred to simply as `the context'
in the remainder of the documentation.  This is used to look up
<I>styles</I>, context-sensitive options that can be used to configure the
completion system.  The context used for lookup may vary during the same
call to the completion system.
<P>

The context string always consists of the following fields, separated
by colons and with a leading colon before the first:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
*
The literal string <B>completion</B>, saying that this style is used by
the completion system.  This distinguishes the context from those used
by, for example, zle widgets and ZFTP functions.
<P>
<DT>*<DD>
The <I>function</I>, if completion is called from a named widget rather
than through the normal completion system.  Typically this is blank, but
it is set by special widgets such as <B>predict-on</B> and the various
functions in the <B>Widget</B> directory of the distribution to the name of
that function, often in an abbreviated form.
<P>
<DT>*<DD>
The <I>completer</I> currently active, the name of the function
without the leading underscore.  A `completer' is in
overall control of how completion is to be performed; `<B>complete</B>'
is the simplest, but other completers exist to perform
related tasks such as correction, or to modify the behaviour of a
later completer.  See
the section `Control Functions' below 
for more information.  
<P>
<DT>*<DD>
The <I>command</I> or a special <B>-</B><I>context</I><B>-</B>, just at it appears
following the <B>#compdef</B> tag or the <B>compdef</B> function.  Completion
functions for commands that have sub-commands usually modify this field
to contain the name of the command followed by a minus sign and the
sub-command.  For example, the completion function for the <B>cvs</B>
command sets this field to <B>cvs-add</B> when completing arguments to
the <B>add</B> subcommand.
<P>
<DT>*<DD>
The <I>argument</I>; this indicates which command line or option argument
we are completing.  For command arguments this generally takes the form
<B>argument-</B><I>n</I>, where <I>n</I> is the number of the argument,
and for arguments to options the form <B>option-</B><I>opt</I><B>-</B><I>n</I>
where <I>n</I> is the number of the argument to option <I>opt</I>.  However,
this is only the case if the command line is parsed with standard
UNIX-style options and arguments, so many completions do not set this.
<P>
<DT>*<DD>
The <I>tag</I>.  Tags are used to discriminate between the types
of matches a completion function can generate in a certain context and
are described further below.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

As an example, the context name
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>:completion::complete:dvips:option-o-1:files</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

says that normal completion was attempted as the first argument to the
option <B>-o</B> of the command <B>dvips</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>dvips -o ...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

and the completion function will generate filenames.
<P>

Each type of completion the system can perform in a given context is
described by a `tag', a short descriptive string such as <B>files</B> in
the example above.  Any completion function may use any tag name it
likes, but a list of the more common ones is given below.
<P>

Usually completion will be tried by all possible tags in an order given
by the completion function.  However, this can be altered by using the
<B>tag-order</B> style.  Completion is then restricted to the list of given
tags in the given order.
<P>

The <B>_complete_help</B> bindable command shows all the contexts and tags
available for completion at a particular point.  This provides an easy
way of finding information for <B>tag-order</B> and other styles.  It is
described in
the section `Bindable Commands' below.
<P>

Styles determine such things as how the matches are generated, similarly
to shell options but with much more control.  They can have any number
of strings as their value.  They are defined with the <B>zstyle</B> builtin
command (see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)).
<P>

When looking up styles the completion system uses full context names,
including the tag.  Looking up the value of a style therefore consists
of two things:  the context, which may be matched as a pattern, and the
name of the style itself, which must be given exactly.
<P>

For example, many completion functions can generate matches in a
simple and a verbose form and use the <B>verbose</B> style to decide
which form should be used.  To make all such functions use the verbose form,
put
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' verbose yes</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

in a startup file (probably <B>.zshrc</B>).
This gives the <B>verbose</B> style the value <B>yes</B> in every
context inside the completion system, unless that context has a more
specific definition.  It is best to avoid giving the context as `<B>*</B>'
in case the style has some meaning outside the completion system.
<P>

Many such general purpose styles can be configured simply by using the
<B>compinstall</B> function.
<P>

A more specific example of the use of the <B>verbose</B> style is by the
completion for the <B>kill</B> builtin.  If the style is set, the builtin
lists full job texts and process command lines; otherwise it shows the
bare job numbers and PIDs.  To turn the style off for this use only:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*' verbose no</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

For even more control, the style can use one of the tags `<B>jobs</B>' or
`<B>processes</B>'.  To turn off verbose display only for jobs:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:kill:*:jobs' verbose no</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <B>-e</B> option to <B>zstyle</B> even allows completion function code to
appear as the argument to a style; this requires some understanding of
the internals of completion functions (see
see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompwid.1.php">zshcompwid</A></I>(1))).  For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle -e ':completion:*' completer '
    if [[ $words[1] = cvs ]]; then
      reply=(_complete)
    else
      reply=(_complete _approximate)
    fi'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

uses the value `<B>_complete</B>' for the <B>completer</B> style in most
contexts, but the value `<B>_complete _approximate</B>' when the first word
on the command line is `<B>cvs</B>'.  This is probably more conveniently done
by specifying the style for two different contexts.  This form can be
slow and should be avoided for commonly examined styles such
as <B>menu</B> and <B>list-rows-first</B>.
<P>

Note that the order in which styles are <I>defined</I> does not matter; the
style mechanism uses the most specific possible match for a particular
style to determine the set of values.  More precisely, strings are
preferred over patterns (for example, `<B>:completion::complete:foo</B>' is
more specific than `<B>:completion::complete:*'</B>), and longer patterns are
preferred over shorter patterns.
<P>

Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend on the completion
function.  However, the following two sections list some of the most
common tags and styles.
<P>

<A NAME="lbEN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Standard Tags</H3>

<P>

<A NAME="lbEO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Standard Styles</H3>

<P>

Note that the values of several of these styles represent boolean
values.  Any of the strings `<B>true</B>', `<B>on</B>',
`<B>yes</B>', and `<B>1</B>' can be used for the value `true' and
any of the strings `<B>false</B>', `<B>off</B>', `<B>no</B>', and `<B>0</B>' for
the value `false'.  The behavior for any other value is undefined 
except where explicitly mentioned.  The default value may
be either true or false if the style is not set.
<P>

Some of these styles are tested first for every possible tag
corresponding to a type of match, and if no style was found, for the
<B>default</B> tag.  The most notable styles of this type are <B>menu</B>, 
<B>list-colors</B> and styles controlling completion listing such as 
<B>list-packed</B> and <B>last-prompt</B>).  When tested for the <B>default</B>
tag, only the <I>function</I> field of the context will be set so that
a style using the default tag will normally be defined along the lines of:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:default' menu ...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>accept-exact</B>
This is tested for the default tag in addition to the tags valid for
the current context.  If it is set to `true' and any of the trial
matches is the same as the string on the command line, this match will
immediately be accepted (even if it would otherwise be considered
ambiguous).
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When completing pathnames (where the tag used is `<B>paths</B>')
this style accepts any number of patterns as the value in addition to
the boolean values.  Pathnames matching one of these
patterns will be accepted immediately even if the command line contains
some more partially typed pathname components and these match no file
under the directory accepted.
<P>

This style is also used by the <B>_expand</B> completer to decide if
words beginning with a tilde or parameter expansion should be
expanded.  For example, if there are parameters
<B>foo</B> and <B>foobar</B>, the string `<B>$foo</B>' will only be expanded if 
<B>accept-exact</B> is set to `true'; otherwise the completion system will
be allowed to complete <B>$foo</B> to <B>$foobar</B>. If the style is set to
`continue', _expand will add the expansion as a match and the completion
system will also be allowed to continue.
</DL>

<DT><B>add-space</B><DD>
This style is used by the <B>_expand</B> completer.  If it is true (the
default), a space will be inserted after all words resulting from the 
expansion, or a slash in the case of directory names.  If the value
is `<B>file</B>', the completer will only add a space
to names of existing files.  Either a boolean true or the value
`<B>file</B>' may be combined with `<B>subst</B>', in which case the completer
will not add a space to words generated from the expansion of a
substitution of the form `<B>$(...)</B>' or `<B>${...}</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>_prefix</B> completer uses this style as a simple boolean value
to decide if a space should be inserted before the suffix.
</DL>

<DT><B>ambiguous</B><DD>
This applies when completing non-final components of filename paths, in
other words those with a trailing slash.  If it is set, the cursor is
left after the first ambiguous component, even if menu completion is in
use.  The style is always tested with the <B>paths</B> tag.
<DT><B>assign-list</B><DD>
When completing after an equals sign that is being treated as an
assignment, the completion system normally completes only one filename.
In some cases the value  may be a list of filenames separated by colons,
as with <B>PATH</B> and similar parameters.  This style can be set to a
list of patterns matching the names of such parameters.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default is to complete lists when the word on the line already
contains a colon.
</DL>

<DT><B>auto-description</B><DD>
If set, this style's value will be used as the description for options that
are not described by the completion functions, but that have exactly
one argument.  The sequence `<B>%d</B>' in the value will be replaced by
the description for this argument.  Depending on personal preferences,
it may be useful to set this style to something like `<B>specify: %d</B>'. 
Note that this may not work for some commands.
<DT><B>avoid-completer</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_all_matches</B> completer to decide if the string 
consisting of all matches should be added to the list currently being
generated.  Its value is a list of names of completers.  If any of
these is the name of the completer that generated the matches in this
completion, the string will not be added.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default value for this style is `<B>_expand _old_list _correct
_approximate</B>', i.e. it contains the completers for which a string
with all matches will almost never be wanted.
</DL>

<DT><B>cache-path</B><DD>
This style defines the path where any cache files containing dumped
completion data are stored.  It defaults to `<B>$ZDOTDIR/.zcompcache</B>', or
`<B>$HOME/.zcompcache</B>' if <B>$ZDOTDIR</B> is not defined.  The completion
cache will not be used unless the <B>use-cache</B> style is set.
<DT><B>cache-policy</B><DD>
This style defines the function that will be used to determine whether
a cache needs rebuilding.  See the section on the <B>_cache_invalid</B>
function below.
<DT><B>call-command</B><DD>
This style is used in the function for commands such as <B>make</B> and
<B>ant</B> where calling the command directly to generate matches suffers
problems such as being slow or, as in the case of <B>make</B> can
potentially causes actions in the makefile to be executed. If it is set
to `true' the command is called to generate matches. The default value
of this style is `false'.
<DT><B>command</B><DD>
In many places, completion functions need to call external commands to
generate the list of completions.  This style can be used to override the
command that is called in some such cases.  The elements of the value are
joined with spaces to form a command line to execute.  The value can also
start with a hyphen, in which case the usual command will be added to the
end; this is most useful for putting `<B>builtin</B>' or `<B>command</B>' in
front to make sure the appropriate version of a command is called, for
example to avoid calling a shell function with the same name as an external
command.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

As an example, the completion function for process IDs uses this
style with the <B>processes</B> tag to generate the IDs to complete and
the list of processes to display (if the <B>verbose</B> style is `true').
The list produced by the command should look like the output of the
<B>ps</B> command.  The first line is not displayed, but is searched for
the string `<B>PID</B>' (or `<B>pid</B>') to find the position of the
process IDs in the following lines.  If the line does not contain
`<B>PID</B>', the first numbers in each of the other lines are taken as the 
process IDs to complete.
<P>

Note that the completion function generally has to call the specified
command for each attempt to generate the completion list.  Hence
care should be taken to specify only commands that take a short
time to run, and in particular to avoid any that may never terminate.
</DL>

<DT><B>commands</B><DD>
This is used by the function completing sub-commands for the system
initialisation scripts (residing in <B>/etc/init.d</B> or somewhere not
too far away from that).  Its values give the default commands to
complete for those commands for which the completion function isn't
able to find them out automatically.  The default for this style are
the two strings `<B>start</B>' and `<B>stop</B>'.
<DT><B>complete</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_expand_alias</B> function when invoked as a
bindable command.  If it set to `true' and the word on the command
line is not the name of an alias, matching alias names will be
completed.
<DT><B>completer</B><DD>
The strings given as the value of this style provide the names of the
completer functions to use. The available completer functions are
described in
the section `Control Functions' below.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Each string may be either the name of a completer function or a string
of the form `<I>function</I><B>:</B><I>name</I>'.  In the first case the
<I>completer</I> field of the context will contain the name of the
completer without the leading underscore and with all other
underscores replaced by hyphens.  In the second case the
<I>function</I> is the name of the completer to call, but the context
will contain the user-defined <I>name</I> in the <I>completer</I> field of
the context.  If the <I>name</I> starts with a hyphen, the string for the
context will be build from the name of the completer function as in
the first case with the <I>name</I> appended to it.  For example: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _complete:-foo</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Here, completion will call the <B>_complete</B> completer twice, once
using `<B>complete</B>' and once using `<B>complete-foo</B>' in the
<I>completer</I> field of the context.  Normally, using the same
completer more than once only makes sense when used with the
`<I>functions</I><B>:</B><I>name</I>' form, because otherwise the context
name will be the same in all calls to the completer; possible
exceptions to this rule are the <B>_ignored</B> and <B>_prefix</B>
completers.
<P>

The default value for this style is `<B>_complete _ignored</B>':
only completion will be done, first using the <B>ignored-patterns</B> style
and the <B>$fignore</B> array and then without ignoring matches.
</DL>

<DT><B>condition</B><DD>
This style is used by the <B>_list</B> completer function to decide if
insertion of matches should be delayed unconditionally. The default is 
`true'.
<DT><B>disabled</B><DD>
If this is set to `true', the <B>_expand_alias</B> completer and bindable 
command will try to expand disabled aliases, too.  The default is
`<B>false</B>'.
<DT><B>disable-stat</B><DD>
This is used with an empty tag by the <B>_cvs</B> function
to decide whether the <B>zsh/stat</B> module should be used to
generate names of modified files in the appropriate places (this is its
only use).  If the style is set, completion will use the <B>ls</B> command.
<DT><B>domains</B><DD>
A list of names of network domains for completion.
If this is not set, domain names will be taken from
the file <B>/etc/resolv.conf</B>.
<DT><B>expand</B><DD>
This style is used when completing strings consisting of multiple
parts, such as path names.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If one of its values is the string `<B>prefix</B>', the partially typed
word from the line will be expanded as far as possible even if trailing
parts cannot be completed.
<P>

If one of its values is the string `<B>suffix</B>', matching names for
components after the first ambiguous one will also be added.  This means
that the resulting string is the longest unambiguous string possible.
However, menu completion can be used to cycle through all matches.
</DL>

<DT><B>fake</B><DD>
This style may be set for any completion context.  It
specifies additional strings that will always be completed in that
context.  The form of each string is `<I>value</I><B>:</B><I>description</I>'; 
the colon and description may be omitted, but any literal colons in
<I>value</I> must be quoted with a backslash.  Any <I>description</I>
provided is shown alongside the value in completion listings.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

It is important to use a sufficiently restrictive context when specifying
fake strings.  Note that the styles <B>fake-files</B> and <B>fake-parameters</B>
provide additional features when completing files or parameters.
</DL>

<DT><B>fake-files</B><DD>
This style is used when completing files and looked up 
without a tag.  Its values are of the form
`<I>dir</I><B>:</B><I>names...</I>'.  This will add the <I>names</I> (strings
separated by spaces) as
possible matches when completing in the directory <I>dir</I>, even if no 
such files really exist.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This can be useful on systems that support special filesystems whose
top-level pathnames can not be listed or generated with glob patterns.
It can also be used for directories for which one does not have read
permission.
</DL>

<DT><B>fake-parameters</B><DD>
This is used by the completion function for parameter names.
Its values are names of parameters that might not yet be
set but should be completed nonetheless.  Each name may also be 
followed by a colon and a string specifying the type of the parameter
(like `<B>scalar</B>', `<B>array</B>' or `<B>integer</B>').  If the type is
given, the name will only be completed if parameters of that type are
required in the particular context.  Names for which no type is
specified will always be completed.
<DT><B>file-patterns</B><DD>
This is used by the standard function for completing filenames,
<B>_files</B>.  If the style is unset up to three tags are offered,
`<B>globbed-files</B>',`<B>directories</B>' and `<B>all-files</B>', depending on
the types of files  expected by the caller of <B>_files</B>.  The first two
(`<B>globbed-files</B>' and `<B>directories</B>') are normally offered
together to make it easier to complete files in sub-directories.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>file-patterns</B> style provides alternatives to the default tags,
which are not used.  Its value consists of elements of the form
`<I>pattern</I><B>:</B><I>tag</I>'; each string may contain any number of
such specifications separated by spaces.
<P>

The <I>pattern</I> is a pattern that is to be used to generate filenames.
Any occurrence of the sequence `<B>%p</B>' is replaced by any pattern(s)
passed by the function calling <B>_files</B>.  Colons in the pattern must
be preceded by a backslash to make them distinguishable from the colon
before the <I>tag</I>.  If more than one pattern is needed, the patterns
can be given inside braces, separated by commas.
<P>

The <I>tag</I>s of all strings in the value will be offered by <B>_files</B>
and used when looking up other styles.  Any <I>tag</I>s in the same
word will be offered at the same time and before later words.
If no `<B>:</B><I>tag</I>' is given the `<B>files</B>' tag will be used.
<P>

The <I>tag</I> may also be followed by an optional second colon and a
description, which will be used for the `<B>%d</B>' in the value of
the <B>format</B> style (if that is set) instead of the default
description supplied by the completion function.  If the description
given here contains itself a `<B>%d</B>', that is replaced with the
description supplied by the completion function.
<P>

For example, to make the <B>rm</B> command first complete only names of
object files and then the names of all files if there is no matching
object file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:rm:*' file-patterns \ 
    '*.o:object-files' '%p:all-files'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

To alter the default behaviour of file completion --- offer files
matching a pattern and directories on the first attempt, then all files
--- to offer only matching files on the first attempt, then directories,
and finally all files:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' file-patterns \ 
    '%p:globbed-files' '*(-/):directories' '*:all-files'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This works even where there is no special pattern: <B>_files</B> matches
all files using the pattern `<B>*</B>' at the first step and stops when it
sees this pattern.  Note also it will never try a pattern more than once
for a single completion attempt.
<P>

During the execution of completion functions, the <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B>
option is in effect, so the characters `<B>#</B>', `<B>~</B>' and `<B>^</B>' have
special meanings in the patterns.
</DL>

<DT><B>file-sort</B><DD>
The standard filename completion function uses this style without a tag
to determine in which order the names should be listed; menu completion
will cycle through them in the same order.  The possible
values are: `<B>size</B>' to sort by the size of the file;
`<B>links</B>' to sort by the number of links to the file;
`<B>modification</B>' (or `<B>time</B>' or `<B>date</B>') to sort by the last
modification time; `<B>access</B>' to sort by the last access time; and
`<B>inode</B>' (or `<B>change</B>') to sort by the last inode change
time.  If the style is set to any other value, or is unset, files will be
sorted alphabetically by name.  If the value contains the string
`<B>reverse</B>', sorting is done in the opposite order.
<DT><B>filter</B><DD>
This is used by the LDAP plugin for e-mail address completion to specify
the attributes to match against when filtering entries.  So for example, if
the style is set to `<B>sn</B>', matching is done against surnames.  Standard
LDAP filtering is used so normal completion matching is bypassed.  If this
style is not set, the LDAP plugin is skipped.  You may also need to set the
<B>command</B> style to specify how to connect to your LDAP server.
<DT><B>force-list</B><DD>
This forces a list of completions to be shown at any point where listing is
done, even in cases where the list would usually be suppressed.
For example, normally the list is only shown if
there are at least two different matches.  By setting this style to
`<B>always</B>', the list will always be shown, even if there is only a
single match that will immediately be accepted.  The style may also
be set to a number.  In this case the list will be shown if there are
at least that many matches, even if they would all insert the same
string.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This style is tested for the default tag as well as for each tag valid
for the current completion.  Hence the listing can be forced only for
certain types of match.
</DL>

<DT><B>format</B><DD>
If this is set for the <B>descriptions</B> tag, its value is used as a
string to display above matches in completion lists.  The sequence
`<B>%d</B>' in this string will be replaced with a short description of
what these matches are.  This string may also contain the sequences to
specify output attributes, such as `<B>%B</B>', `<B>%S</B>' and
`<B>%{</B>...<B>%}</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The style is tested with each tag valid for the current completion
before it is tested for the <B>descriptions</B> tag.  Hence different format 
strings can be defined for different types of match.
<P>

Note also that some completer functions define additional
`<B>%</B>'-sequences.  These are described for the completer functions that 
make use of them.
<P>

Some completion functions display messages that may be customised by
setting this style for the <B>messages</B> tag.  Here, the `<B>%d</B>' is
replaced with a message given by the completion function.
<P>

Finally, the format string is looked up with the <B>warnings</B> tag, 
for use when no matches could be generated at all.  In this case the
`<B>%d</B>' is replaced with the descriptions for the matches that were
expected separated by spaces.  The sequence `<B>%D</B>' is replaced with
the same descriptions separated by newlines.
<P>

It is possible to use printf-style field width specifiers with `<B>%d</B>'
and similar escape sequences.  This is handled by the <B>zformat</B>
builtin command from the <B>zsh/zutil</B> module, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).
</DL>

<DT><B>glob</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_expand</B> completer.  If
it is set to `true' (the default), globbing will be attempted on the
words resulting from a previous substitution (see the <B>substitute</B>
style) or else the original string from the line.
<DT><B>global</B><DD>
If this is set to `true' (the default), the <B>_expand_alias</B>
completer and bindable command will try to expand global aliases.
<DT><B>group-name</B><DD>
The completion system can group different types of matches, which appear
in separate lists.  This style can be used to give the names of groups
for particular tags.  For example, in command position the completion
system generates names of builtin and external commands, names of
aliases, shell functions and parameters and reserved words as possible
completions.  To have the external commands and shell functions listed
separately:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:commands' group-name commands
zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*:functions' group-name functions</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

As a consequence, any match with the same tag will be displayed in the
same group.
<P>

If the name given is the empty string the name of the tag for
the matches will be used as the name of the group.  So, to have all
different types of matches displayed separately, one can just set:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' group-name ''</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

All matches for which no group name is defined will be put in a group
named <B>-default-</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>group-order</B><DD>
This style is additional to the <B>group-name</B> style to specify the
order for display of the groups defined by that style (compare <B>tag-order</B>,
which determines which completions appear at all).  The groups named
are shown in the given order; any other groups
are shown in the order defined by the completion function.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example, to have names of builtin commands, shell functions and
external commands appear in that order when completing in command
position:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*' group-order \ 
       builtins functions commands</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>groups</B><DD>
A list of names of UNIX groups.  If this is not set,
group names are taken from the YP database or the file `<B>/etc/group</B>'.
<DT><B>hidden</B><DD>
If this is set to true, matches for the given context
will not be listed, although
any description for the matches set with the <B>format</B> style will be
shown.  If it is set to `<B>all</B>', not even the description will be
displayed.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that the matches will still be completed; they are just not shown 
in the list.  To avoid having matches considered as possible
completions at all, the <B>tag-order</B> style can be modified as described
below.
</DL>

<DT><B>hosts</B><DD>
A list of names of hosts that should be completed.  If this is not set,
hostnames are taken from the file `<B>/etc/hosts</B>'.
<DT><B>hosts-ports</B><DD>
This style is used by commands that need or accept hostnames and
network ports.  The strings in the value should be of the form
`<I>host</I><B>:</B><I>port</I>'.  Valid ports are determined by the presence
of hostnames; multiple ports for the same host may appear.
<DT><B>ignore-line</B><DD>
This is tested for each tag valid for the current completion.  If
it is set to `<B>true</B>', none of the words that are already on the line
will be considered as possible completions.  If it is set to
`<B>current</B>', the word the cursor is on will not be considered as a
possible completion.  The value `<B>current-shown</B>' is similar but only
applies if the list of completions is currently shown on the screen.
Finally, if the style is set to `<B>other</B>', no word apart from the
current one will be considered as a possible completion.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The values `<B>current</B>' and `<B>current-shown</B>' are a bit like the
opposite of the <B>accept-exact</B> style:  only strings with
missing characters will be completed.
<P>

Note that you almost certainly don't want to set this to `true' or
`<B>other</B>' for a general
context such as `<B>:completion:*</B>'.  This is because it would disallow
completion of, for example, options multiple times even if the command
in question accepts the option more than once.
</DL>

<DT><B>ignore-parents</B><DD>
The style is tested without a tag by the function completing pathnames
in order to determine whether to ignore
the names of directories already mentioned in the current word, or the
name of the current working directory.  The value must include one or both
of the following strings:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>parent</B>
The name of any directory whose path is already contained in the word on
the line is ignored.  For example, when completing after <B>foo/../</B>, the
directory <B>foo</B> will not be considered a valid completion.
<DT><B>pwd</B><DD>
The name of the current working directory will not be completed; hence,
for example, completion after <B>../</B> will not use the name of the current
directory.
</DL>
<P>

In addition, the value may include one or both of:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>..</B>
Ignore the specified directories only when the word on the line contains
the substring `<B>../</B>'.
<DT><B>directory</B><DD>
Ignore the specified directories only when names of directories are
completed, not when completing names of files.
</DL>
<P>

Excluded values act in a similar fashion to values of the
<B>ignored-patterns</B> style, so they can be restored to consideration by
the <B>_ignored</B> completer.
</DL>

<DT><B>ignored-patterns</B><DD>
A list of patterns; any trial completion matching one of the patterns
will be excluded from consideration.  The
<B>_ignored</B> completer can appear in the list of completers to
restore the ignored matches.  This is a more configurable
version of the shell parameter <B>$fignore</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that the
<B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> option is set during the execution of completion
functions, so the characters `<B>#</B>', `<B>~</B>' and `<B>^</B>' have special
meanings in the patterns.
</DL>

<DT><B>insert</B><DD>
This style is used by the <B>_all_matches</B> completer to decide whether to
insert the list of all matches unconditionally instead of adding the
list as another match.
<DT><B>insert-ids</B><DD>
When completing process IDs, for example as arguments to the <B>kill</B> and
<B>wait</B> builtins the name of a
command may be converted to the appropriate process ID.  A problem
arises when the process name typed is not unique.  By default (or if this
style is set explicitly to `<B>menu</B>') the name will be converted
immediately to a set of possible IDs, and menu completion will be started
to cycle through them.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the value of the style is `<B>single</B>',
the shell will wait until the user has typed enough to make the command
unique before converting the name to an ID; attempts at completion will
be unsuccessful until that point.  If the value is any other
string, menu completion will be started when the string typed by the
user is longer than the common prefix to the corresponding IDs.
</DL>

<DT><B>insert-tab</B><DD>
If this is set to `true', the completion system will
insert a TAB character (assuming that was used to start completion) instead
of performing completion when there is no non-blank character to the left
of the cursor.  If it is set to `false', completion will be done even there.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The value may also contain the substrings `<B>pending</B>' or
`<B>pending=</B><I>val</I>'.  In this case, the typed character will be
inserted instead of staring completion when there is unprocessed input
pending.  If a <I>val</I> is given, completion will not be done if there
are at least that many characters of unprocessed input.  This is often
useful when pasting characters into a terminal.  Note
however, that it relies on the <B>$PENDING</B> special parameter from the
<B>zsh/zle</B> module being set properly which is not guaranteed on all
platforms.
<P>

The default value of this style is `true' except for completion within
<B>vared</B> builtin command where it is `false'.
</DL>

<DT><B>insert-unambiguous</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_match</B> and <B>_approximate</B> completers.
These completers are often used with menu completion since the word typed
may bear little resemblance to the final completion.
However, if this style is `true', the completer will start menu
completion only if it could find no unambiguous initial string at
least as long as the original string typed by the user.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

In the case of the <B>_approximate</B> completer, the completer
field in the context will already have been set to one of
<B>correct-</B><I>num</I> or <B>approximate-</B><I>num</I>, where <I>num</I> is the
number of errors that were accepted.
<P>

In the case of the <B>_match</B> completer, the style may also be set to
the string `<B>pattern</B>'.  Then the pattern on the line is left
unchanged if it does not match unambiguously.
</DL>

<DT><B>keep-prefix</B><DD>
This style is used by the <B>_expand</B> completer.  If it is `true', the
completer will try to keep a prefix containing a tilde or parameter
expansion.  Hence, for example, the string `<B>~/f*</B>' would be expanded to
`<B>~/foo</B>' instead of `<B>/home/user/foo</B>'.  If the style is set to
`<B>changed</B>' (the default), the prefix will only be left unchanged if
there were other changes between the expanded words and the original
word from the command line.  Any other value forces the prefix to be
expanded unconditionally.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The behaviour of expand when this style is true is to cause <B>_expand</B>
to give up when a single expansion with the restored prefix is the same
as the original; hence any remaining completers may be called.
</DL>

<DT><B>last-prompt</B><DD>
This is a more flexible form of the <B>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</B> option.
If it is true, the completion system will try to return the cursor to
the previous command line after displaying a completion list.  It is
tested for all tags valid for the current completion, then the
<B>default</B> tag.  The cursor will be moved back to the
previous line if this style is `true' for all types of match.  Note
that unlike the <B>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</B> option this is independent of the
numeric prefix argument.
<DT><B>list</B><DD>
This style is used by the <B>_history_complete_word</B> bindable command.
If it is set to `true' it has no effect.  If it is set to `false'
matches will not be listed.  This overrides the setting of the options
controlling listing behaviour, in particular <B>AUTO_LIST</B>.  The context
always starts with `<B>:completion:history-words</B>'.
<DT><B>list-colors</B><DD>
If the <B>zsh/complist</B> module is loaded, this style can be used to set
color specifications.  This mechanism replaces the use of the
<B>ZLS_COLORS</B> and <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> parameters described in
the section `The zsh/complist Module' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1), but the syntax is the same.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If this style is set for the <B>default</B> tag, the strings in the value 
are taken as specifications that are to be used everywhere.  If it is
set for other tags, the specifications are used only for matches of
the type described by the tag.  For this to work best, the <B>group-name</B>
style must be set to an empty string.  
<P>

In addition to setting styles for specific tags, it is also possible to
use group names specified explicitly by the <B>group-name</B> tag together
with the `<B>(group)</B>' syntax allowed by the <B>ZLS_COLORS</B> and
<B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> parameters and simply using the <B>default</B> tag.
<P>

It is possible to use any color specifications already set up for the GNU
version of the <B>ls</B> command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:default' list-colors ${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The default colors are the same as for the GNU <B>ls</B> command and can be
obtained by setting the style to an empty string (i.e. <B>''</B>).
</DL>

<DT><B>list-grouped</B><DD>
If this style is `true' (the default), the completion system will try to
make certain completion listings more compact by grouping matches.
For example, options for commands that have the same description (shown
when the <B>verbose</B> style is set to `true') will appear as a single
entry.  However, menu selection can be used to cycle through all the
matches.
<DT><B>list-packed</B><DD>
This is tested for each tag valid in the current context as well as the
<B>default</B> tag.  If it is set to `true', the corresponding matches
appear in listings as if the <B>LIST_PACKED</B> option were set.  If it is
set to `false', they are listed normally.
<DT><B>list-prompt</B><DD>
If this style is set for the <B>default</B> tag,
completion lists that don't fit on the screen can be scrolled (see
the description of the <B>zsh/complist</B> module in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)).  The value, if not the empty string, will be displayed after every
screenful and the shell will prompt for a key press; if the style is
set to the empty string,
a default prompt will be used.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The value may contain the escape sequences:
`<B>%l</B>' or `<B>%L</B>', which will be replaced by the number of the last line
displayed and the total number of lines; `<B>%m</B>' or `<B>%M</B>', 
the number of the  last match shown and the total number of
matches; and `<B>%p</B>' and `<B>%P</B>', `<B>Top</B>'
when at the beginning of the list, `<B>Bottom</B>' when at the end and the
position shown as a percentage of the total length otherwise.  In each
case the form with the uppercase letter will be replaced by a string of fixed
width, padded to the  right with spaces, while the lowercase form will
be replaced by a variable width string.  As in other prompt strings, the
escape sequences `<B>%S</B>', `<B>%s</B>', `<B>%B</B>', `<B>%b</B>', `<B>%U</B>',
`<B>%u</B>' for entering and leaving the display modes
standout, bold and underline are also available, as is the form
`<B>%{</B>...<B>%}</B>' for enclosing escape sequences which display with zero
width.
</DL>

<DT><B>list-rows-first</B><DD>
This style is tested in the same way as the <B>list-packed</B> style and
determines whether matches are to be listed in a rows-first fashion as
if the <B>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</B> option were set.
<DT><B>list-suffixes</B><DD>
This style is used by the function that completes filenames.  If it is
true, and completion is attempted on a string containing multiple partially
typed pathname components, all ambiguous components will be shown.
Otherwise, completion stops at the first ambiguous component.
<DT><B>list-separator</B><DD>
The value of this style is used in completion listing to separate the
string to complete from a description when possible (e.g. when
completing options).  It defaults to `<B>-</B><B>-</B>' (two hyphens).
<DT><B>local</B><DD>
This is for use with functions that complete URLs for which the
corresponding files are available directly from the filing system.
Its value should consist of three strings: a
hostname, the path to the default web pages for the server, and the
directory name used by a user placing web pages within their home
area.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' local toast \ 
    /var/http/public/toast public_html</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Completion after `<B><A HREF="http://toast/stuff/">http://toast/stuff/</A></B>' will look for files in the
directory <B>/var/http/public/toast/stuff</B>,  while completion after
`<B><A HREF="http://toast/~yousir/">http://toast/~yousir/</A></B>' will look for files in the directory
<B>~yousir/public_html</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>mail-directory</B><DD>
If set, zsh will assume that mailbox files can be found in
the directory specified.  It defaults to `<B>~/Mail</B>'.
<DT><B>match-original</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_match</B> completer.  If it is set to
<B>only</B>, <B>_match</B> will try to generate matches without inserting a
`<B>*</B>' at the cursor position.  If set to any other non-empty value,
it will first try to generate matches without inserting the `<B>*</B>'
and if that yields no matches, it will try again with the `<B>*</B>'
inserted.  If it is unset or set to the empty string, matching will
only be performed with the `<B>*</B>' inserted.
<DT><B>matcher</B><DD>
This style is tested separately for each tag valid in the current
context.  Its value is added to any match specifications given by the 
<B>matcher-list</B> style.  It should be in the form described in
the section `Matching Control' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompwid.1.php">zshcompwid</A></I>(1).
<DT><B>matcher-list</B><DD>
This style can be set to a list of match specifications that are to
be applied everywhere. Match specifications are described in
the section `Matching Control' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompwid.1.php">zshcompwid</A></I>(1).
The completion system will try them one after another for each completer
selected.  For example, to try first simple completion and, if that
generates no matches, case-insensitive completion:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

By default each specification replaces the previous one; however, if a
specification is prefixed with <B>+</B>, it is added to the existing list.
Hence it is possible to create increasingly general specifications
without repetition:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' matcher-list '' '+m{a-Z}={A-Z}' '+m{A-Z}={a-z}'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

It is possible to create match specifications valid for particular
completers by using the third field of the context.  For example, to
use the completers <B>_complete</B> and <B>_prefix</B> but only allow
case-insensitive completion with <B>_complete</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _prefix
zstyle ':completion:*:complete:*' matcher-list \ 
       '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

User-defined names, as explained for the <B>completer</B> style, are
available.  This makes it possible to try the same completer more than
once with different match specifications each time.  For example, to try
normal completion without a match specification, then normal completion
with case-insensitive matching, then correction, and finally
partial-word completion:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _correct _complete:foo
zstyle ':completion:*:complete:*' matcher-list \ 
    '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'
zstyle ':completion:*:foo:*' matcher-list \ 
    'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z} r:|[-_./]=* r:|=*'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If the style is unset in any context no match specification is applied.
Note also that some completers such as <B>_correct</B> and <B>_approximate</B>
do not use the match specifications at all, though these completers will
only ever called once even if the <B>matcher-list</B> contains more than
one element.
<P>

Where multiple specifications are useful, note that the <I>entire</I>
completion is done for each element of <B>matcher-list</B>, which can
quickly reduce the shell's performance.  As a rough rule of thumb,
one to three strings will give acceptable performance.  On the other
hand, putting multiple space-separated values into the same string does
not have an appreciable impact on performance.
</DL>

<DT><B>max-errors</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_approximate</B> and <B>_correct</B> completer functions
to determine the maximum number of errors to allow.  The completer will try
to generate completions by first allowing one error, then two errors, and
so on, until either a match or matches were found or the maximum number of
errors given by this style has been reached.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the value for this style contains the string `<B>numeric</B>', the 
completer function will take any numeric argument as the
maximum number of errors allowed. For example, with
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:approximate:::' max-errors 2 numeric</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

two errors are allowed if no numeric argument is given, but with
a numeric argument of six (as in `<B>ESC-6 TAB</B>'), up to six
errors are accepted.  Hence with a value of `<B>0 numeric</B>', no correcting
completion will be attempted unless a numeric argument is given.
<P>

If the value contains the string `<B>not-numeric</B>', the completer
will <I>not</I> try to generate corrected
completions when given a numeric argument, so in this case the number given
should be greater than zero.  For example, `<B>2 not-numeric</B>' specifies that
correcting completion with two errors will usually be performed, but if a
numeric argument is given, correcting completion will not be
performed.
<P>

The default value for this style is `<B>2 numeric</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>max-matches-width</B><DD>
This style is used to determine the trade off between the width of the
display used for matches and the width used for their descriptions when
the <B>verbose</B> style is in effect.  The value gives the number of
display columns to reserve for the matches.  The default is half the
width of the screen.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This has the most impact when several matches have the
same description and so will be grouped together.  Increasing the style
will allow more matches to be grouped together; decreasing it will allow
more of the description to be visible.
</DL>

<DT><B>menu</B><DD>
If this is true in the context of any of the tags defined
for the current completion menu completion will be used.  The value for
a specific tag will take precedence over that for the `<B>default</B>' tag.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If none of the values found in this way is true but at least
one is set to `<B>auto</B>', the shell behaves as if the <B>AUTO_MENU</B>
option is set.
<P>

If one of the values is explicitly set to false, menu
completion will be explicitly turned off, overriding the
<B>MENU_COMPLETE</B> option and other settings.
<P>

In the form `<B>yes=</B><I>num</I>', where `<B>yes</B>' may be any of the
true values (`<B>yes</B>', `<B>true</B>', `<B>on</B>' and `<B>1</B>'),
menu completion will be turned on if there are at least <I>num</I> matches.
In the form `<B>yes=long</B>', menu completion will be turned on
if the list does not fit on the screen.  This does not activate menu
completion if the widget normally only lists completions, but menu
completion can be activated in that case with the value `<B>yes=long-list</B>'
(Typically, the value `<B>select=long-list</B>' described later is more
useful as it provides control over scrolling.)
<P>

Similarly, with any of the `false' values (as in `<B>no=10</B>'), menu
completion will <I>not</I> be used if there are <I>num</I> or more matches.  
<P>

The value of this widget also controls menu selection, as implemented by
the <B>zsh/complist</B> module.  The following values may appear either
alongside or instead of the values above.
<P>

If the value contains the string `<B>select</B>', menu selection
will be started unconditionally.
<P>

In the form `<B>select=</B><I>num</I>', menu selection will only be started if
there are at least <I>num</I> matches.  If the values for more than one
tag provide a number, the smallest number is taken.
<P>

Menu selection can be turned off explicitly by defining a value
containing the string`<B>no-select</B>'.
<P>

It is also possible to start menu selection only if the list of
matches does not fit on the screen by using the value
`<B>select=long</B>'.  To start menu selection even if the current widget
only performs listing, use the value `<B>select=long-list</B>'.
<P>

To turn on menu completion or menu selection when a there are a certain
number of matches <I>or</I> the list of matches does not fit on the
screen, both of `<B>yes=</B>' and `<B>select=</B>' may be given twice, once
with a number and once with `<B>long</B>' or `<B>long-list</B>'.
<P>

Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of menu selection.
The word `<B>interactive</B>' in the value causes interactive mode
to be entered immediately when menu selection is started; see
the description of the <B>zsh/complist</B> module in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).RE for a description of interactive mode.  Including the string
`<B>search</B>' does the same for incremental search mode.  To select backward
incremental search, include the string `<B>search-backward</B>'.
)
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>muttrc</B><DD>
If set, gives the location of the mutt configuration file.  It defaults
to `<B>~/.muttrc</B>'.
<DT><B>numbers</B><DD>
This is used with the <B>jobs</B> tag.  If it is `true', the shell will
complete job numbers instead of the shortest unambiguous prefix
of the job command text.  If the value is a number, job numbers will
only be used if that many words from the job descriptions are required to
resolve ambiguities.  For example, if the value is `<B>1</B>', strings will
only be used if all jobs differ in the first word on their command lines.
<DT><B>old-list</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_oldlist</B> completer.  If it is set to `<B>always</B>',
then standard widgets which perform listing will retain the current list of
matches, however they were generated; this can be turned off explicitly
with the value `<B>never</B>', giving the behaviour without the <B>_oldlist</B>
completer.  If the style is unset, or any other value, then the existing
list of completions is displayed if it is not already; otherwise, the
standard completion list is generated; this is the default behaviour of
<B>_oldlist</B>.  However, if there is an old list and this style contains
the name of the completer function that generated the list, then the
old list will be used even if it was generated by a widget which does
not do listing.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example, suppose you type <B>^Xc</B> to use the <B>_correct_word</B>
widget, which generates a list of corrections for the word under the
cursor.  Usually, typing <B>^D</B> would generate a standard list of
completions for the word on the command line, and show that.  With
<B>_oldlist</B>, it will instead show the list of corrections already
generated.
<P>

As another example consider the <B>_match</B> completer: with the
<B>insert-unambiguous</B> style set to `true' it inserts only a common prefix
string, if there is any.  However, this may remove parts of the original
pattern, so that further completion could produce more matches than on the
first attempt.  By using the <B>_oldlist</B> completer and setting this style
to <B>_match</B>, the list of matches generated on the first attempt will be
used again.
</DL>

<DT><B>old-matches</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_all_matches</B> completer to decide if an old
list of matches should be used if one exists.  This is selected by one of
the `true' values or by the string `<B>only</B>'.  If
the value is `<B>only</B>', <B>_all_matches</B> will only use an old list
and won't have any effect on the list of matches currently being
generated.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If this style is set it is generally unwise to call the <B>_all_matches</B>
completer unconditionally.  One possible use is for either this style or
the <B>completer</B> style to be defined with the <B>-e</B> option to
<B>zstyle</B> to make the style conditional.
</DL>

<DT><B>old-menu</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_oldlist</B> completer.  It controls how menu
completion behaves when a completion has already been inserted and the
user types a standard completion key such as <B>TAB</B>.  The default
behaviour of <B>_oldlist</B> is that menu completion always continues
with the existing list of completions.  If this style is set to
`false', however, a new completion is started if the old list was
generated by a different completion command; this is the behaviour without
the <B>_oldlist</B> completer.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example, suppose you type <B>^Xc</B> to generate a list of corrections,
and menu completion is started in one of the usual ways.  Usually, or with
this style set to <B>false</B>, typing <B>TAB</B> at this point would start
trying to complete the line as it now appears.  With <B>_oldlist</B>, it
instead continues to cycle through the list of corrections.
</DL>

<DT><B>original</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_approximate</B> and <B>_correct</B>
completers to decide if the original string should be added as
a possible completion.  Normally, this is done only if there are
at least two possible corrections, but if this style is set to `true', it
is always added.  Note that the style will be examined with the
completer field in the context name set to <B>correct-</B><I>num</I> or
<B>approximate-</B><I>num</I>, where <I>num</I> is the number of errors that
were accepted.
<DT><B>packageset</B><DD>
This style is used when completing arguments of the Debian `<B>dpkg</B>'
program.  It contains an override for the default package set
for a given context.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:complete:dpkg:option--status-1:*' \ 
               packageset avail</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

causes available packages, rather than only installed packages,
to be completed for `dpkg --status'.
</DL>

<DT><B>path</B><DD>
The function that completes color names uses this style with the 
<B>colors</B> tag.  The value should be the pathname of a file
containing color names in the format of an X11 <B>rgb.txt</B> file.  If
the style is not set but this file is found in one of various standard
locations it will be used as the default.
<DT><B>pine-directory</B><DD>
If set, specifies the directory containing PINE mailbox files.  It
defaults to `<B>~/mail</B>'.
<DT><B>ports</B><DD>
A list of Internet service names (network ports) to complete.  If this is
not set, service names are taken from the file `<B>/etc/services</B>'.
<DT><B>prefix-hidden</B><DD>
This is used for certain completions which share a common prefix, for
example command options beginning with dashes.  If it is `true', the
prefix will not be shown in the list of matches.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default value for this style is `false'.
</DL>

<DT><B>prefix-needed</B><DD>
This, too, is used for matches with a common prefix.  If it is set to
`true' this common prefix must be typed by the user to generate the
matches.  In the case of command options, this means that the initial
`<B>-</B>', `<B>+</B>', or `<B>-</B><B>-</B>' must be typed explicitly before option
names will be completed.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default value for this style is `true'.
</DL>

<DT><B>preserve-prefix</B><DD>
This style is used when completing path names.  Its value should be a
pattern matching an initial prefix of the word to complete that should
be left unchanged under all circumstances.  For example, on some Unices
an initial `<B>//</B>' (double slash) has a special meaning; setting
this style to the string `<B>//</B>' will preserve it.  As another example,
setting this style to `<B>?:/</B>' under Cygwin would allow completion
after `<B>a:/...</B>' and so on.
<DT><B>range</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_history</B> completer and the
<B>_history_complete_word</B> bindable command to decide which words
should be completed.  
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If it is a singe number, only the last <I>N</I> words from the history
will be completed.
<P>

If it is a range of the form `<I>max</I><B>:</B><I>slice</I>',
the last <I>slice</I> words will be completed; then if that
yields no matches, the <I>slice</I> words before those will be tried and 
so on.  This process stops either when at least one match was been
found, or <I>max</I> words have been tried.
<P>

The default is to complete all words from the history at once.
</DL>

<DT><B>regular</B><DD>
This style is used by the <B>_expand_alias</B> completer and bindable 
command.  If set to `<B>true</B>' (the default), regular aliases will be
expanded but only in command position.  If it is set to `<B>false</B>',
regular aliases will never be expanded.   If it is set to `<B>always</B>',
regular aliases will be expanded even if not in command position.
<DT><B>remote-access</B><DD>
If set to <B>false</B>, certain commands will be prevented from making
Internet connections to retrieve remote information.  This includes the
completion for the <B>CVS</B> command.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

It is not always possible to know if connections are in fact to a remote
site, so some may be prevented unnecessarily.
</DL>

<DT><B>remove-all-dups</B><DD>
The <B>_history_complete_word</B> bindable command and the <B>_history</B>
completer use this to decide if all duplicate matches should be
removed, rather than just consecutive duplicates.
<DT><B>select-prompt</B><DD>
If this is set for the <B>default</B> tag, its
value will be displayed during menu selection (see the <B>menu</B> style
above) when the completion list does not fit on the screen as a
whole.  The same escapes as for the <B>list-prompt</B> style are
understood, except that the numbers refer to the match or line the mark is
on.  A default prompt is used when the value is the empty string.
<DT><B>select-scroll</B><DD>
This style is tested for the <B>default</B> tag and determines how a
completion list is scrolled during a menu selection (see the <B>menu</B>
style above) when the completion list does not fit on the screen as a
whole.  If the value is `<B>0</B>' (zero), the list is scrolled by
half-screenfuls; if it is a positive integer, the list is scrolled by the
given number of lines; if it is a negative number, the list is scrolled by a
screenful minus the absolute value of the given number of lines.
The default is to scroll by single lines.
<DT><B>separate-sections</B><DD>
This style is used with the <B>manuals</B> tag when completing names of
manual pages.  If it is `true', entries for different sections are
added separately using tag names of the form `<B>manual.</B><I>X</I>',
where <I>X</I> is the section number.  When the <B>group-name</B> style is
also in effect, pages from different sections will appear separately.
This style is also used similarly with the <B>words</B> style when
completing words for the dict command. It allows words from different
dictionary databases to be added separately.
The default for this style is `false'.
<DT><B>single-ignored</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_ignored</B> completer when there is only one match.
If its value is `<B>show</B>', the single match will be
displayed but not inserted.  If the value is `<B>menu</B>', then the single
match and the original string are both added as matches and menu completion
is started, making it easy to select either of them.
<DT><B>sort</B><DD>
Many completion widgets call <B>_description</B> at some point which
decides whether the matches are added sorted or unsorted (often
indirectly via <B>_wanted</B> or <B>_requested</B>).  This style can be set
explicitly to one of the usual true or false values as an override.
If it is not set for the context, the standard behaviour of the
calling widget is used.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The style is tested first against the full context including the tag, and
if that fails to produce a value against the context without the tag.
<P>

If the calling widget explicitly requests unsorted matches, this is usually
honoured.  However, the default (unsorted) behaviour of completion
for the command history may be overridden by setting the style to
<B>true</B>.
<P>

In the <B>_expand</B> completer, if it is set to
`true', the expansions generated will always be sorted.  If it is set
to `<B>menu</B>', then the expansions are only sorted when they are offered 
as single strings but not in the string containing all possible
expansions.
</DL>

<DT><B>special-dirs</B><DD>
Normally, the completion code will not produce the directory names
`<B>.</B>' and `<B>..</B>' as possible completions.  If this style is set to
`true', it will add both `<B>.</B>' and `<B>..</B>' as possible completions;
if it is set to `<B>..</B>', only `<B>..</B>' will be added.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The following example sets <B>special-dirs</B> to `<B>..</B>' when the
current prefix is empty, is a single `<B>.</B>', or consists only of a path
beginning with `<B>../</B>'.  Otherwise the value is `false'.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle -e ':completion:*' special-dirs \ 
   '[[ $PREFIX = (../)#(|.|..) ]] &amp;&amp; reply=(..)'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>squeeze-slashes</B><DD>
If set to `true', sequences of slashes in filename paths (for example in
`<B>foo//bar</B>') will be treated as a single slash.  This is the usual
behaviour of UNIX paths.  However, by default the file completion
function behaves as if there were a `<B>*</B>' between the slashes.
<DT><B>stop</B><DD>
If set to `true', the <B>_history_complete_word</B> bindable
command will stop once when reaching the beginning or end of the
history.  Invoking <B>_history_complete_word</B> will then wrap around to 
the opposite end of the history.  If this style is set to `false' (the 
default), <B>_history_complete_word</B> will loop immediately as in a
menu completion.
<DT><B>strip-comments</B><DD>
If set to `true', this style causes non-essential comment text to be
removed from completion matches.  Currently it is only used when
completing e-mail addresses where it removes any display name from the
addresses, cutting them down to plain <I><A HREF="mailto:user@host">user@host</A></I> form.
<DT><B>subst-globs-only</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_expand</B> completer.  If it is set to `true',
the expansion will only be used if it resulted from globbing; hence,
if expansions resulted from the use of the <B>substitute</B> style
described below, but these were not further changed by globbing, the
expansions will be rejected.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default for this style is `false'.
</DL>

<DT><B>substitute</B><DD>
This boolean style controls whether the <B>_expand</B> completer will
first try to expand all substitutions in the string (such as
`<B>$(...)</B>' and `<B>${...}</B>').
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default is `true'.
</DL>

<DT><B>suffix</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_expand</B> completer if the word starts with a
tilde or contains a parameter expansion.  If it is set to `true', the
word will only be expanded if it doesn't have a suffix, i.e. if it is
something like `<B>~foo</B>' or `<B>$foo</B>' rather than `<B>~foo/</B>' or
`<B>$foo/bar</B>', unless that suffix itself contains characters eligible
for expansion.  The default for this style is `true'.
<DT><B>tag-order</B><DD>
This provides a mechanism for sorting how the tags available in a
particular context will be used.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The values for the style are sets of space-separated lists of tags.
The tags in each value will be tried at the same time; if no match is
found, the next value is used.  (See the <B>file-patterns</B> style for
an exception to this behavior.)
<P>

For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:complete:-command-:*' tag-order \ 
    'commands functions'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

specifies that completion in command position first offers
external commands and shell functions.  Remaining tags will be tried if
no completions are found.
<P>

In addition to tag names, each string in the value may take one of the
following forms:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-</B>
If any value consists of only a hyphen,
then <I>only</I> the tags specified in the other values are
generated.  Normally all tags not explicitly selected are tried last
if the specified tags fail to generate any matches.  This means 
that a single value consisting only of a single hyphen
turns off completion.
<DT><B>!</B> <I>tags</I>...<DD>
A string starting with an exclamation mark
specifies names of tags that are <I>not</I> to be used.  The effect is
the same as if all other possible tags for the context had been
listed.
<DT><I>tag</I><B>:</B><I>label</I> ...<DD>
Here, <I>tag</I> is one of the standard tags and <I>label</I> is an
arbitrary name.  Matches are generated as normal but the name <I>label</I>
is used in contexts instead of <I>tag</I>.  This is not useful in words
starting with <B>!</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the <I>label</I> starts with a hyphen, the <I>tag</I> is prepended to the
<I>label</I> to form the name used for lookup.  This can be
used to make the completion system try a certain tag more than once,
supplying different style settings for each attempt; see below for an
example.
</DL>

<DT><I>tag</I><B>:</B><I>label</I><B>:</B><I>description</I><DD>
As before, but <B>description</B> will replace the `<B>%d</B>' in
the value of the <B>format</B> style instead of the default description
supplied by the completion function.  Spaces in the description must
be quoted with a backslash.  A `<B>%d</B>' appearing
in <I>description</I> is replaced with the description given by the
completion function.
</DL>
<P>

In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or several
patterns in the form `<B>{</B><I>pat1</I><B>,</B><I>pat2...</I><B>}</B>'.  In this
case all matching tags will be used except 
for any given explicitly in the same string.
<P>

One use of these features is to try
one tag more than once, setting other styles differently on
each attempt, but still to use all the other tags without having to
repeat them all.  For example, to make completion of function names in
command position ignore all the completion functions starting with an
underscore the first time completion is tried:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:-command-:*' tag-order \ 
    'functions:-non-comp *' functions
zstyle ':completion:*:functions-non-comp' ignored-patterns '_*'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the <B>functions</B> tag
will be replaced by <B>functions-non-comp</B>.  The <B>ignored-patterns</B> style 
is set for this tag to exclude functions starting with an underscore.
If there are no matches, the second value of the
<B>tag-order</B> style is used which completes functions using the default
tag, this time presumably including all function names.
<P>

The matches for one tag can be split into different groups.  For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' tag-order \ 
    'options:-long:long\ options
     options:-short:short\ options
     options:-single-letter:single\ letter\ options'

zstyle ':completion:*:options-long' ignored-patterns '[-+](|-|[^-]*)'
zstyle ':completion:*:options-short' ignored-patterns '--*' '[-+]?'
zstyle ':completion:*:options-single-letter' ignored-patterns '???*'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

With the <B>group-names</B> style set, options beginning with
`<B>-</B><B>-</B>', options beginning with a single `<B>-</B>' or `<B>+</B>' but
containing multiple characters, and single-letter options will be
displayed in separate groups with different descriptions.
<P>

Another use of patterns is to
try multiple match specifications one after another.  The
<B>matcher-list</B> style offers something similar, but it is tested very
early in the completion system and hence can't be set for single
commands nor for more specific contexts.  Here is how to
try normal completion without any match specification and, if that
generates no matches, try again with case-insensitive matching, restricting
the effect to arguments of the command <B>foo</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*:*:foo:*' tag-order '*' '*:-case'
zstyle ':completion:*-case' matcher 'm:{a-z}={A-Z}'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

First, all the tags offered when completing after <B>foo</B> are tried using
the normal tag name.  If that generates no matches, the second value of
<B>tag-order</B> is used, which tries all tags again except that this time
each has <B>-case</B> appended to its name for lookup of styles.  Hence this
time the value for the <B>matcher</B> style from the second call to <B>zstyle</B>
in the example is used to make completion case-insensitive.
<P>

It is possible to use the <B>-e</B> option of the <B>zstyle</B> builtin
command to specify conditions for the use of particular tags.  For
example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle -e '*:-command-:*' tag-order '
    if [[ -n $PREFIX$SUFFIX ]]; then
      reply=( )
    else
      reply=( - )
    fi'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Completion in command position will be attempted only if the string
typed so far is not empty.  This is tested using the <B>PREFIX</B>
special parameter; see
zshcompwid
for a description of parameters which are special inside completion widgets.
Setting <B>reply</B> to an empty array provides the default
behaviour of trying all tags at once; setting it to an
array containing only a hyphen disables the use of all tags and hence of
all completions.
<P>

If no <B>tag-order</B> style has been defined for a context, the strings
`<B>(|*-)argument-* (|*-)option-* values</B>' and `<B>options</B>' plus all
tags offered by the completion function will be used to provide a
sensible default behavior that causes arguments (whether normal command
arguments or arguments of options) to be completed before option names for
most commands.
</DL>

<DT><B>urls</B><DD>
This is used together with the the <B>urls</B> tag by
functions completing URLs.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the value consists of more than one string, or if the only string
does not name a file or directory, the strings are used as the URLs to
complete.
<P>

If the value contains only one string which is the name of a normal 
file the URLs are taken from that file (where the URLs may be
separated by white space or newlines).
<P>

Finally, if the only string in the value names a directory, the
directory hierarchy rooted at this directory gives the completions.  The
top level directory should be the file access method, such as
`<B>http</B>', `<B>ftp</B>', `<B>bookmark</B>' and so on.  In many cases the next
level of directories will be a filename.  The directory hierarchy can
descend as deep as necessary.
<P>

For example, 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' urls ~/.urls
mkdir -p ~/.urls/ftp/<A HREF="ftp://ftp.zsh.org">ftp.zsh.org</A>/pub/development
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

allows completion of all the components of the URL
<B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development">ftp://ftp.zsh.org/pub/development</A></B> after suitable commands such as
`<B>netscape</B>' or `<B>lynx</B>'.  Note, however, that access methods and
files are completed separately, so if the <B>hosts</B> style is set hosts
can be completed without reference to the <B>urls</B> style.
<P>

See the description in the function <B>_urls</B> itself
for more information (e.g. `<B>more $^fpath/_urls(N)</B>').
</DL>

<DT><B>use-cache</B><DD>
If this is set, the completion caching layer is activated for any completions
which use it (via the <B>_store_cache</B>, <B>_retrieve_cache</B>, and
<B>_cache_invalid</B> functions).  The directory containing the cache
files can be changed with the <B>cache-path</B> style.
<DT><B>use-compctl</B><DD>
If this style is set to a string <I>not</I> equal to <B>false</B>, <B>0</B>,
<B>no</B>, and <B>off</B>, the completion system may use any completion
specifications defined with the <B>compctl</B> builtin command.  If the
style is unset, this is done only if the <B>zsh/compctl</B> module
is loaded.  The string may also contain the substring `<B>first</B>' to
use completions defined with `<B>compctl -T</B>', and the substring
`<B>default</B>' to use the completion defined with `<B>compctl -D</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that this is only intended to smooth the transition from
<B>compctl</B> to the new completion system and may disappear in the
future.
<P>

Note also that the definitions from <B>compctl</B> will only be used if
there is no specific completion function for the command in question.  For
example, if there is a function <B>_foo</B> to complete arguments to the
command <B>foo</B>, <B>compctl</B> will never be invoked for <B>foo</B>.
However, the <B>compctl</B> version will be tried if <B>foo</B> only uses
default completion.
</DL>

<DT><B>use-perl</B><DD>
Various parts of the function system use awk to extract words from
files or command output as this universally available.  However, many
versions of awk have arbitrary limits on the size of input.  If this
style is set, perl will be used instead.  This is almost always
preferable if perl is available on your system.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Currently this is only used in completions for `make', but it may be
extended depending on authorial frustration.
</DL>

<DT><B>users</B><DD>
This may be set to a list of usernames to be completed.
If it is not set or the string on the line
doesn't match any of the strings in this list, all usernames will be
completed.
<DT><B>users-hosts</B><DD>
The values of this style should be of the form
`<I>user</I><B>@</B><I>host</I>' or `<I>user</I><B>:</B><I>host</I>'. It is used for
commands that need pairs of
user- and hostnames.  These commands will complete usernames from this
style (only), and will restrict subsequent hostname completion to hosts
paired with that user in one of the values of the style.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

It is possible to group values for sets of commands which allow a remote
login, such as <B>rlogin</B> and <B>ssh</B>, by using the <B>my-accounts</B> tag.
Similarly, values for sets of commands which usually refer to the
accounts of other people, such as <B>talk</B> and <B>finger</B>, can be
grouped by using the <B>other-accounts</B> tag.  More ambivalent commands
may use the <B>accounts</B> tag.
</DL>

<DT><B>users-hosts-ports</B><DD>
Like <B>users-hosts</B> but used for commands like <B>telnet</B> and
containing strings of the form `<I>user</I><B>@</B><I>host</I><B>:</B><I>port</I>'.
<DT><B>verbose</B><DD>
If set, as it is by default, the completion listing is more verbose.
In particular many commands show descriptions for options if this
style is `true'.
<DT><B>word</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_list</B> completer, which prevents the insertion of
completions until a second completion attempt when the line has not
changed.  The normal way of finding out if the line has changed is to
compare its entire contents between the two occasions.  If this style is
true, the comparison is instead performed only on the current word.
Hence if completion is performed on another word with the same contents,
completion will not be delayed.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbEP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONTROL FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

The initialization script <B>compinit</B> redefines all the widgets
which perform completion to call the supplied widget function
<B>_main_complete</B>.  This function acts as a wrapper calling the
so-called `completer' functions that generate matches.  If
<B>_main_complete</B> is called with arguments, these are taken as the
names of completer functions to be called in the order given.  If no
arguments are given, the set of functions to try is taken from the
<B>completer</B> style.  For example, to use normal completion and
correction if that doesn't generate any matches:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _correct</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

after calling <B>compinit</B>. The default value for this style is
`<B>_complete _ignored</B>', i.e. normally only ordinary completion is tried,
first with the effect of the <B>ignored-patterns</B> style and then without
it.  The <B>_main_complete</B> function uses the return value of the completer
functions to decide if other completers should be called.  If the return
value is zero, no other completers are tried and the <B>_main_complete</B>
function returns.
<P>

If the first argument to <B>_main_complete</B> is a single hyphen, the
arguments will not be taken as names of completers.  Instead, the
second argument gives a name to use in the <I>completer</I> field of the 
context and the other arguments give a command name and arguments to
call to generate the matches.
<P>

The following completer functions are contained in the distribution,
although users may write their own.  Note that in contexts the leading
underscore is stripped, for example basic completion is performed in the
context `<B>:completion::complete:</B><I>...</I>'.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>_all_matches</B>
This completer can be used to add a string consisting of all other
matches.  As it influences later completers it must appear as the first
completer in the list.  The list of all matches is affected by the
<B>avoid-completer</B> and <B>old-matches</B> styles described above.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

It may be useful to use the <B>_generic</B> function described below
to bind <B>_all_matches</B> to its own keystroke, for example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -C all-matches complete-word _generic
bindkey '^Xa' all-matches
zstyle ':completion:all-matches:*' old-matches only
zstyle ':completion:all-matches::::' completer _all_matches</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>_approximate</B><DD>
This is similar to the basic <B>_complete</B> completer but allows the
completions to undergo corrections.  The maximum number of errors can be
specified by the <B>max-errors</B> style; see the description of
approximate matching in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1)
for how errors are counted.  Normally this completer will only be tried
after the normal <B>_complete</B> completer:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete _approximate</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This will give correcting completion if and only if
normal completion yields no possible completions.  When
corrected completions are found, the completer will normally start
menu completion allowing you to cycle through these strings.
<P>

This completer uses the tags <B>corrections</B> and <B>original</B> when
generating the possible corrections and the original string.  The
<B>format</B> style for the former may contain the additional sequences
`<B>%e</B>' and `<B>%o</B>' which will be replaced by the number of errors
accepted to generate the corrections and the original string,
respectively.
<P>

The completer progressively increases the number of errors allowed up to
the limit by the <B>max-errors</B> style, hence if a completion is found
with one error, no completions with two errors will be shown, and so on.
It modifies the completer name in the context to indicate the number of
errors being tried: on the first try the completer field contains
`<B>approximate-1</B>', on the second try `<B>approximate-2</B>', and so on.
<P>

When <B>_approximate</B> is called from another function, the number of
errors to accept may be passed with the <B>-a</B> option.  The argument
is in the same format as the <B>max-errors</B> style, all in one string.
<P>

Note that this completer (and the <B>_correct</B> completer mentioned
below) can be quite expensive to call, especially when a large number
of errors are allowed.  One way to avoid this is to set up the
<B>completer</B> style using the <B>-e</B> option to zstyle so that some
completers are only used when completion is attempted a second time on 
the same string, e.g.:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle -e ':completion:*' completer '
  if [[ $_last_try != &quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot; ]]; then
    _last_try=&quot;$HISTNO$BUFFER$CURSOR&quot;
    reply=(_complete _match _prefix)
  else
    reply=(_ignored _correct _approximate)
  fi'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This uses the <B>HISTNO</B> parameter and the <B>BUFFER</B> and <B>CURSOR</B>
special parameters that are available inside zle and completion
widgets to find out if the command line hasn't changed since the last
time completion was tried.  Only then are the <B>_ignored</B>,
<B>_correct</B> and <B>_approximate</B> completers called.
</DL>

<DT><B>_complete</B><DD>
This completer generates all possible completions in a context-sensitive
manner, i.e. using the settings defined with the <B>compdef</B> function
explained above and the current settings of all special parameters.
This gives the normal completion behaviour.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

To complete arguments of commands, <B>_complete</B> uses the utility function
<B>_normal</B>, which is in turn responsible for finding the particular
function; it is described below.  Various contexts of the form
<B>-</B><I>context</I><B>-</B> are handled specifically. These are all
mentioned above as possible arguments to the <B>#compdef</B> tag.
<P>

Before trying to find a function for a specific context, <B>_complete</B> 
checks if the parameter `<B>compcontext</B>' is set. Setting
`<B>compcontext</B>' allows the usual completion dispatching to be
overridden which is useful in places such as a function that uses
<B>vared</B> for input. If it is set to an array, the elements are taken
to be the possible matches which will be completed using the tag
`<B>values</B>' and the description `<B>value</B>'. If it is set to an
associative array, the keys are used as the possible completions and
the values (if non-empty) are used as descriptions for the matches.  If
`<B>compcontext</B>' is set to a string containing colons, it should be of
the form `<I>tag</I><B>:</B><I>descr</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>'.  In this case the
<I>tag</I> and <I>descr</I> give the tag and description to use and the
<I>action</I> indicates what should be completed in one of the forms
accepted by the <B>_arguments</B> utility function described below.
<P>

Finally, if `<B>compcontext</B>' is set to a string without colons, the
value is taken as the name of the context to use and the function
defined for that context will be called.  For this purpose, there is a
special context named <B>-command-line-</B> that completes whole command
lines (commands and their arguments).  This is not used by the completion
system itself but is nonetheless handled when explicitly called.
</DL>

<DT><B>_correct</B><DD>
Generate corrections, but not completions, for the current word; this is
similar to <B>_approximate</B> but will not allow any number of extra
characters at the cursor as that completer does.  The effect is
similar to spell-checking.  It is based on <B>_approximate</B>, but the
completer field in the context name is <B>correct</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example, with:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:::::' completer _complete _correct _approximate
zstyle ':completion:*:correct:::' max-errors 2 not-numeric
zstyle ':completion:*:approximate:::' max-errors 3 numeric</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

correction will accept up to two errors.  If a numeric argument is
given, correction will not be performed, but correcting completion
will be, and will accept as many errors as given by the numeric
argument.  Without a numeric argument, first correction and then
correcting completion will be tried, with the first one accepting two
errors and the second one accepting three errors.
<P>

When <B>_correct</B> is called as a function, the number of errors to accept
may be given following the <B>-a</B> option.  The argument is in the same
form a values to the <B>accept</B> style, all in one string.
<P>

This completer function is intended to be used without the
<B>_approximate</B> completer or, as in the example, just before
it.  Using it after the <B>_approximate</B> completer is useless since
<B>_approximate</B> will at least generate the corrected strings
generated by the <B>_correct</B> completer -- and probably more.
</DL>

<DT><B>_expand</B><DD>
This completer function does not really perform completion, but instead
checks if the word on the command line is eligible for expansion and,
if it is, gives detailed control over how this expansion is done.  For
this to happen, the completion system needs to be invoked with
<B>complete-word</B>, not <B>expand-or-complete</B> (the default binding for
<B>TAB</B>), as otherwise the string will be expanded by the shell's
internal mechanism before the completion system is started.
Note also this completer should be called before the <B>_complete</B> 
completer function.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The tags used when generating expansions are <B>all-expansions</B> for the
string containing all possible expansions, <B>expansions</B> when adding
the possible expansions as single matches and <B>original</B> when adding
the original string from the line.  The order in which these strings are
generated, if at all, can be controlled by the <B>group-order</B> and
<B>tag-order</B> styles, as usual.
<P>

The format string for <B>all-expansions</B> and for <B>expansions</B> may
contain the sequence `<B>%o</B>' which will be replaced by the original
string from the line.
<P>

The kind of expansion to be tried is controlled by the <B>substitute</B>,
<B>glob</B> and <B>subst-globs-only</B> styles.
<P>

It is also possible to call <B>_expand</B> as a function, in which case the
different modes may be selected with options: <B>-s</B> for
<B>substitute</B>, <B>-g</B> for <B>glob</B> and <B>-o</B> for <B>subst-globs-only</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>_expand_alias</B><DD>
If the word the cursor is on is an alias, it is expanded and no other
completers are called.  The types of aliases which are to be expanded can
be controlled with the styles <B>regular</B>, <B>global</B> and <B>disabled</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This function is also a bindable command, see
the section `Bindable Commands' below.
</DL>

<DT><B>_history</B><DD>
Complete words from the shell's command  history.  This completer 
can be controlled by the <B>remove-all-dups</B>, and <B>sort</B> styles as for the
<B>_history_complete_word</B> bindable command, see
the section `Bindable Commands' below
and
the section `Completion System Configuration' above.
<DT><B>_ignored</B><DD>
The <B>ignored-patterns</B> style can be set to a list of patterns which are
compared against possible completions; matching ones are removed.
With this completer those matches can be reinstated, as
if no <B>ignored-patterns</B> style were set.  The completer actually
generates its own list of matches; which completers are invoked
is determined in the same way as for the <B>_prefix</B> completer.
The <B>single-ignored</B> style is also available as described above.
<DT><B>_list</B><DD>
This completer allows the insertion of matches to be delayed until
completion is attempted a second time without the word on the line
being changed.  On the first attempt, only the list of matches will be
shown.  It is affected by the styles <B>condition</B> and <B>word</B>, see
the section `Completion System Configuration' above.
<DT><B>_match</B><DD>
This completer is intended to be used after the <B>_complete</B>
completer.  It behaves similarly but the string on the command line may
be a pattern to match against trial completions.  This gives the effect
of the <B>GLOB_COMPLETE</B> option.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Normally completion will be performed by taking the pattern from the line,
inserting a `<B>*</B>' at the cursor position and comparing the resulting
pattern with the possible completions generated.  This can be modified
with the <B>match-original</B> style described above.
<P>

The generated matches will be offered in a menu completion unless the
<B>insert-unambiguous</B> style is set to `true'; see the description above
for other options for this style.
<P>

Note that matcher specifications defined globally or used by the
completion functions (the styles <B>matcher-list</B> and <B>matcher</B>) will
not be used.
</DL>

<DT><B>_menu</B><DD>
This completer was written as simple example function to show how menu
completion can be enabled in shell code. However, it has the notable
effect of disabling menu selection which can be useful with
<B>_generic</B> based widgets. It should be used as the first completer in
the list.  Note that this is independent of the setting of the
<B>MENU_COMPLETE</B> option and does not work with the other menu
completion widgets such as <B>reverse-menu-complete</B>, or
<B>accept-and-menu-complete</B>.
<DT><B>_oldlist</B><DD>
This completer controls how the standard completion widgets behave
when there is an existing list of completions which may have been
generated by a special completion (i.e. a separately-bound completion
command).  It allows the ordinary completion keys to continue to use the
list of completions thus generated, instead of producing a new list of
ordinary contextual completions.
It should appear in the list of completers before any of
the widgets which generate matches.  It uses two styles: <B>old-list</B> and
<B>old-menu</B>, see
the section `Completion System Configuration' above.
<DT><B>_prefix</B><DD>
This completer can be used to try completion with the suffix (everything
after the cursor) ignored.  In other words, the suffix will not be
considered to be part of the word to complete.  The effect is similar
to the <B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B> command.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>completer</B> style is used to decide which other completers are to
be called to generate matches.  If this style is unset, the list of
completers set for the current context is used -- except, of course, the
<B>_prefix</B> completer itself.  Furthermore, if this completer appears
more than once in the list of completers only those completers not
already tried by the last invocation of <B>_prefix</B> will be called.
<P>

For example, consider this global <B>completer</B> style:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer \ 
    _complete _prefix _correct _prefix:foo</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Here, the <B>_prefix</B> completer tries normal completion but ignoring the
suffix.  If that doesn't generate any matches, and neither does
the call to the <B>_correct</B> completer after it, <B>_prefix</B> will 
be called a second time and, now only trying correction with the
suffix ignored.  On the second invocation the completer part of the
context appears as `<B>foo</B>'.
<P>

To use <B>_prefix</B> as the last resort and try only normal completion
when it is invoked:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer _complete ... _prefix
zstyle ':completion::prefix:*' completer _complete</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <B>add-space</B> style is also respected.  If it is set to `true' then
<B>_prefix</B> will insert a space between the matches generated (if any) 
and the suffix.
<P>

Note that this completer is only useful if the
<B>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</B> option is set; otherwise, the cursor will
be moved to the end of the current word before the completion code is
called and hence there will be no suffix.
</DL>

<DT><B>bashcompinit</B><DD>
This function provides compatibility with bash's programmable completion
system.  When run it will define the functions, <B>compgen</B> and
<B>complete</B> which correspond to the bash builtins with the same names.
It will then be possible to use completion specifications and functions
written for bash.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbEQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BINDABLE COMMANDS</H2>

<P>

In addition to the context-dependent completions provided, which are
expected to work in an intuitively obvious way, there are a few widgets
implementing special behaviour which can be bound separately to keys.  The
following is a list of these and their default bindings.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>_bash_completions</B>
This function is used by two widgets, <B>_bash_complete-word</B> and
<B>_bash_list-choices</B>.  It exists to provide compatibility with
completion bindings in bash.  The last character of the binding determines
what is completed: `<B>!</B>', command names; `<B>$</B>', environment variables;
`<B>@</B>', host names; `<B>/</B>', file names; `<B>~</B>' user names.  In bash, the
binding preceded by `<B>\e</B>' gives completion, and preceded by `<B>^X</B>'
lists options.  As some of these bindings clash with standard zsh
bindings, only `<B>\e~</B>' and `<B>^X~</B>' are bound by default.  To add the
rest, the following should be added to <B>.zshrc</B> after <B>compinit</B> has
been run:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

<P>

This includes the bindings for `<B>~</B>' in case they were already bound to
something else; the completion code does not override user bindings.
</DL>

<DT><B>_correct_filename (^XC)</B><DD>
Correct the filename path at the cursor position.  Allows up to six errors
in the name.  Can also be called with an argument to correct
a filename path, independently of zle; the correction is printed on
standard output.
<DT><B>_correct_word</B> (^Xc)<DD>
Performs correction of the current argument using the usual contextual
completions as possible choices. This stores the string
`<B>correct-word</B>' in the <I>function</I> field of the context name and
then calls the <B>_correct</B> completer.
<DT><B>_expand_alias (^Xa)</B><DD>
This function can be used as a completer and as a bindable command.
It expands the word the cursor is on if it is an alias.  The types of
alias expanded can be controlled with the styles <B>regular</B>, <B>global</B>
and <B>disabled</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When used as a bindable command there is one additional feature that
can be selected by setting the <B>complete</B> style to `true'.  In this
case, if the word is not the name of an alias, <B>_expand_alias</B> tries
to complete the word to a full alias name without expanding it.  It
leaves the cursor directly after the completed word so that invoking
<B>_expand_alias</B> once more will expand the now-complete alias name.
</DL>

<DT><B>_expand_word (^Xe)</B><DD>
Performs expansion on the current word:  equivalent to the standard
<B>expand-word</B> command, but using the <B>_expand</B> completer.  Before
calling it, the <I>function</I> field of the context is set to
`<B>expand-word</B>'.
<DT><B>_generic</B><DD>
This function is not defined as a widget and not bound by
default.  However, it can be used to define a widget and will then
store the name of the widget in the <I>function</I> field of the context 
and call the completion system.  This allows custom completion widgets
with their own set of style settings to be defined easily.  For example, 
to define a widget that performs normal completion and starts
menu selection:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -C foo complete-word _generic
bindkey '...' foo
zstyle ':completion:foo:*' menu yes select=1</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>_history_complete_word</B> (\e/)<DD>
Complete words from the shell's command history. This uses the
<B>list</B>, <B>remove-all-dups</B>, <B>sort</B>, and <B>stop</B> styles.
<DT><B>_most_recent_file (^Xm)</B><DD>
Complete the name of the most recently modified file matching the pattern
on the command line (which may be blank).  If given a numeric argument
<I>N</I>, complete the <I>N</I>th most recently modified file.  Note the
completion, if any, is always unique.
<DT><B>_next_tags</B> (^Xn)<DD>
This command alters the set of matches used to that for the next tag, or
set of tags, either as given by the <B>tag-order</B> style or as set by
default; these matches would otherwise not be available.
Successive invocations of the command cycle through all possible sets of
tags.
<DT><B>_read_comp (^X^R)</B><DD>
Prompt the user for a string, and use that to perform completion on the
current word.  There are two possibilities for the string.  First, it can
be a set of words beginning `<B>_</B>', for example `<B>_files -/</B>', in which
case the function with any arguments will be called to generate the
completions.  Unambiguous parts of the function name will be completed
automatically (normal completion is not available at this point) until a
space is typed.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Second, any other string will be passed as a set of arguments to
<B>compadd</B> and should hence be an expression specifying what should
be completed.
<P>

A very restricted set of editing commands is available when reading the
string:  `<B>DEL</B>' and `<B>^H</B>' delete the last character; `<B>^U</B>' deletes
the line, and `<B>^C</B>' and `<B>^G</B>' abort the function, while `<B>RET</B>'
accepts the completion.  Note the string is used verbatim as a command
line, so arguments must be quoted in accordance with standard shell rules.
<P>

Once a string has been read, the next call to <B>_read_comp</B> will use the
existing string instead of reading a new one.  To force a new string to be
read, call <B>_read_comp</B> with a numeric argument.
</DL>

<DT><B>_complete_debug (^X?)</B><DD>
This widget performs ordinary completion, but captures in a temporary file
a trace of the shell commands executed by the completion system.  Each
completion attempt gets its own file.  A command to view each of these
files is pushed onto the editor buffer stack.
<DT><B>_complete_help (^Xh)</B><DD>
This widget displays information about the context names, 
the tags, and the completion functions used 
when completing at the current cursor position. If given a numeric
argument other than <B>1</B> (as in `<B>ESC-2 ^Xh</B>'), then the styles
used and the contexts for which they are used will be shown, too.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that the information about styles may be incomplete; it depends on the
information available from the completion functions called, which in turn
is determined by the user's own styles and other settings.
</DL>

<DT><B>_complete_tag (^Xt)</B><DD>
This widget completes symbol tags created by the <B>etags</B> or <B>ctags</B>
programmes (note there is no connection with the completion system's tags)
stored in a file <B>TAGS</B>, in the format used by <B>etags</B>, or <B>tags</B>, in the
format created by <B>ctags</B>.  It will look back up the path hierarchy for
the first occurrence of either file; if both exist, the file <B>TAGS</B> is
preferred.  You can specify the full path to a <B>TAGS</B> or <B>tags</B> file by
setting the parameter <B>$TAGSFILE</B> or <B>$tagsfile</B> respectively.
The corresponding completion tags used are <B>etags</B> and <B>vtags</B>, after
emacs and vi respectively.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbER">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>UTILITY FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

Descriptions follow for utility functions that may be
useful when writing completion functions.  If functions are installed in
subdirectories, most of these reside in the
<B>Base</B> subdirectory.  Like the example 
functions for commands in the distribution, the utility functions
generating matches all follow the convention of returning zero if they
generated completions and non-zero if no matching completions could be 
added.
<P>

Two more features are offered by the <B>_main_complete</B> function.  The
arrays <B>compprefuncs</B> and <B>comppostfuncs</B> may contain
names of functions that are to be called immediately before or after
completion has been tried.  A function will only be called once unless
it explicitly reinserts itself into the array.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>_all_labels</B> [ <B>-x</B> ] [ <B>-12VJ</B> ] <I>tag</I> <I>name</I> <I>descr</I> [ <I>command</I> <I>args</I> ... ]
This is a convenient interface to the <B>_next_label</B> function below,
implementing the loop shown in the <B>_next_label</B> example.  The
<I>command</I> and its arguments are called to generate the matches.  The
options stored in the parameter <I>name</I> will automatically be inserted
into the <I>args</I> passed to the <I>command</I>.  Normally, they are put
directly after the <I>command</I>, but if one of the <I>args</I> is a single
hyphen, they are inserted directly before that.  If the hyphen is the last
argument, it will be removed from the argument list before the
<I>command</I> is called.  This allows <B>_all_labels</B> to be used in almost all
cases where the matches can be generated by a single call to the
<B>compadd</B> builtin command or by a call to one of the utility functions.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>local expl
...
if _requested foo; then
  ...
  _all_labels foo expl '...' compadd ... - $matches
fi</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Will complete the strings from the <B>matches</B> parameter, using
<B>compadd</B> with additional options which will take precedence over
those generated by <B>_all_labels</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>_alternative</B> [ <B>-C</B> <I>name</I> ] <I>spec</I> ...<DD>
This function is useful in simple cases where multiple tags are available.
Essentially it implements a loop like the one described for the <B>_tags</B>
function below.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The tags to use and the action to perform if a tag is requested are
described using the <I>spec</I>s which are of the form:
`<I>tag</I><B>:</B><I>descr</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>'.  The <I>tag</I>s are offered using
<B>_tags</B> and if the tag is requested, the <I>action</I> is executed with the
given description <I>descr</I>.  The <I>action</I>s are those accepted
by the <B>_arguments</B> function (described below), excluding the
`<B>-&gt;</B><I>state</I>' and `<B>=</B><I>...</I>' forms.
<P>

For example, the <I>action</I> may be a simple function call:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_alternative \ 
    'users:user:_users' \ 
    'hosts:host:_hosts'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

offers usernames and hostnames as possible matches,
generated by the <B>_users</B> and <B>_hosts</B> functions respectively.
<P>

Like <B>_arguments</B>, this functions uses <B>_all_labels</B> to execute 
the actions, which will loop over all sets of tags.  Special handling is
only required if there is an additional valid tag, for example inside a
function called from <B>_alternative</B>.
<P>

Like <B>_tags</B> this function supports the <B>-C</B> option to give a
different name for the argument context field.
</DL>

<DT><B>_arguments</B> [ <B>-swWACRS</B> ] [ <B>-O</B> <I>name</I> ] [ <B>-M</B> <I>matchspec</I> ] [ <B>:</B> ] <I>spec</I> ...<DD>
This function can be used to give a complete specification for
completion for a command whose arguments follow standard UNIX option and
argument conventions.  The following forms specify individual sets of
options and arguments; to avoid ambiguity, these may be separated from the
options to <B>_arguments</B> itself by a single colon.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>n</I><B>:</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>n</I><B>::</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
This describes the <I>n</I>'th normal argument.  The <I>message</I> will be 
printed above the matches generated and the <I>action</I> indicates what can
be completed in this position (see below).  If there are two colons
before the <I>message</I> the argument is optional.  If the
<I>message</I> contains only white space, nothing will be printed above
the matches unless the action adds an explanation string itself.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>:</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>::</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
Similar, but describes the <I>next</I> argument, whatever number that
happens to be.  If all arguments are specified in this form in the
correct order the numbers are unnecessary.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>*:</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>*::</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>*:::</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
This describes how arguments (usually non-option arguments, those not
beginning with <B>-</B> or <B>+</B>) are to be completed when neither
of the first two forms was provided.  Any number of arguments can
be completed in this fashion.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With two colons before the <I>message</I>, the <B>words</B> special array and
the <B>CURRENT</B> special parameter are modified to refer only to the
normal arguments when the <I>action</I> is executed or evaluated.  With
three colons before the <I>message</I> they are modified to refer only to
the normal arguments covered by this description.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<I>optspec</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>optspec</I>:<I>...</I>
This describes an option.  The colon indicates handling for one or more
arguments to the option; if it is not present, the option is assumed to
take no arguments.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

By default, options are multi-character name, one `<B>-</B><I>word</I>' per
option.  With <B>-s</B>, options may be single characters, with more than
one option per word, although words starting with two hyphens, such as
`<B>-</B><B>-prefix</B>', are still considered complete option names.  This is
suitable for standard GNU options.
<P>

The combination of <B>-s</B> with <B>-w</B> allows single-letter options to be
combined in a single word even if one or more of the options take
arguments.  For example, if <B>-a</B> takes an argument, with no
<B>-s</B> `<B>-ab</B>' is considered as a single (unhandled) option; with
<B>-s</B> <B>-ab</B> is an option with the argument `<B>b</B>'; with both <B>-s</B>
and <B>-w</B>, <B>-ab</B> may be the option <B>-a</B> and the option(-b) with
arguments still to come.
<P>

The option <B>-W</B> takes this a stage further:  it is possible to
complete single-letter options even after an argument that occurs in the
same word.  However, it depends on the action performed whether options
will really be completed at this point.  For more control, use a
utility function like <B>_guard</B> as part of the action.
<P>

The following forms are available for the initial <I>optspec</I>, whether
or not the option has arguments.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>*</B><I>optspec</I>
Here <I>optspec</I> is one of the remaining forms below.  This indicates
the following <I>optspec</I> may be repeated.  Otherwise if the
corresponding option is already present on the command line to the left
of the cursor it will not be offered again.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-</B><I>optname</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>+</B><I>optname</I>
In the simplest form the <I>optspec</I> is just the option name beginning
with a minus or a plus sign, such as `<B>-foo</B>'.  The first argument for
the option (if any) must follow as a <I>separate</I> word directly after the
option.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Either of `<B>-+</B><I>optname</I>' and `<B>+-</B><I>optname</I>' can be used to
specify that <B>-</B><I>optname</I> and <B>+</B><I>optname</I> are both valid.
<P>

In all the remaining forms, the leading `<B>-</B>' may be replaced by or
paired with `<B>+</B>' in this way.
</DL>

<DT><B>-</B><I>optname</I><B>-</B><DD>
The first argument of the option must come directly after the option name
<I>in the same word</I>.  For example, `<B>-foo-:</B><I>...</I>' specifies that
the completed option and argument will look like `<B>-foo</B><I>arg</I>'.
<DT><B>-</B><I>optname</I><B>+</B><DD>
The first argument may appear immediately after <I>optname</I> in the same
word, or may appear as a separate word after the option.  For example,
`<B>-foo+:</B><I>...</I>' specifies that the completed option and argument
will look like either `<B>-foo</B><I>arg</I>' or `<B>-foo</B> <I>arg</I>'.
<DT><B>-</B><I>optname</I><B>=</B><DD>
The argument may appear as the next word, or in same word as the option
name provided that it is separated from it by an equals sign, for
example `<B>-foo=</B><I>arg</I>' or `<B>-foo</B> <I>arg</I>'.
<DT><B>-</B><I>optname</I><B>=-</B><DD>
The argument to the option must appear after an equals sign in the same
word, and may not be given in the next argument.
<DT><I>optspec</I><B>[</B><I>explanation</I><B>]</B><DD>
An explanation string may be appended to any of the preceding forms of
<I>optspec</I> by enclosing it in brackets, as in `<B>-q[query operation]</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>verbose</B> style is used to decide whether the explanation strings
are displayed with the option in a completion listing.
<P>

If no bracketed explanation string is given but the <B>auto-description</B>
style is set and only one argument is described for this <I>optspec</I>, the
value of the style is displayed, with any appearance of the sequence
`<B>%d</B>' in it replaced by the <I>message</I> of the first <I>optarg</I>
that follows the <I>optspec</I>; see below.
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

It is possible for options with a literal `+' or `<B>=</B>' to
appear, but that character must be quoted, for example `<B>-\+</B>'.
<P>

Each <I>optarg</I> following an <I>optspec</I> must take one of the
following forms:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>:</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>::</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
An argument to the option; <I>message</I> and <I>action</I> are treated as
for ordinary arguments.  In the first form, the argument is mandatory,
and in the second form it is optional.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This group may be repeated for options which take multiple arguments.
In other words,
<B>:</B><I>message1</I><B>:</B><I>action1</I><B>:</B><I>message2</I><B>:</B><I>action2</I>
specifies that the option takes two arguments.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>:*</B><I>pattern</I><B>:</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>:*</B><I>pattern</I><B>::</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>:*</B><I>pattern</I><B>:::</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>
This describes multiple arguments.  Only the last <I>optarg</I> for
an option taking multiple arguments may be
given in this form.  If the <I>pattern</I> is empty (i.e., <B>:*:</B>), all
the remaining words on the line are to be completed as described by the
<I>action</I>; otherwise, all the words up to a word matching the
<I>pattern</I> are to be completed using the <I>action</I>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Multiple colons are treated as for the `<B>*:</B><I>...</I>' forms for
ordinary arguments:  when the <I>message</I> is preceded by two colons,
the <B>words</B> special array and the <B>CURRENT</B> special parameter are
modified during the execution or evaluation of the <I>action</I> to refer
only to the words after the option.  When preceded by three colons, they
are modified to refer only to the words covered by this description.
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>



</DL>
<P>

Any literal colon in an <I>optname</I>, <I>message</I>, or <I>action</I>
must be preceded by a backslash, `<B>\:</B>'.
<P>

Each of the forms above may be preceded by a list in parentheses
of option names and argument numbers.  If the given option is on
the command line, the options and arguments indicated in parentheses
will not be offered.  For example, 
`<B>(-two -three 1)-one:...</B>' completes the option `<B>-one</B>'; if this
appears on the command line, the options <B>-two</B> and <B>-three</B> and the
first ordinary argument will not be completed after it.
`<B>(-foo):</B><I>...</I>' specifies an ordinary argument completion;
<B>-foo</B> will not be completed if that argument is already present.
<P>

Other items may appear in the list of excluded options to indicate
various other items that should not be applied when the current
specification is matched: a single star (<B>*</B>) for the rest arguments
(i.e. a specification of the form `<B>*:...</B>'); a colon (<B>:</B>)
for all normal (non-option-) arguments; and a hyphen (<B>-</B>) for all
options.  For example, if `<B>(*)</B>' appears before an option and the
option appears on the command line, the list of remaining arguments
(those shown in the above table beginning with `<B>*:</B>') will not be
completed.
<P>

To aid in reuse of specifications, it is possible to precede any of the
forms above with `<B>!</B>'; then the form will no longer be completed,
although if the option or argument appears on the command line they will
be skipped as normal.  The main use for this is when the arguments are
given by an array, and <B>_arguments</B> is called repeatedly for more
specific contexts: on the first call `<B>_arguments $global_options</B>' is
used, and on subsequent calls `<B>_arguments !$^global_options</B>'.
<P>

In each of the forms above the <I>action</I> determines how
completions should be generated.  Except for the `<B>-&gt;</B><I>string</I>'
form below, the <I>action</I> will be executed by calling the
<B>_all_labels</B> function to process all tag labels.  No special handling
of tags is needed unless a function call introduces a new one.
<P>

The forms for <I>action</I> are as follows.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B> </B> (single unquoted space)
This is useful where an argument is required but it is not possible or
desirable to generate matches for it.  The
<I>message</I> will be displayed but no completions listed.  Note
that even in this case the colon at the end of the <I>message</I> is
needed; it may only be omitted when neither a <I>message</I>
nor an <I>action</I> is given.
<DT><B>(</B><I>item1</I> <I>item2</I> <I>...</I><B>)</B><DD>
One of a list of possible matches, for example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>:foo:(foo bar baz</B><B>)</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>((</B><I>item1</I>\:<I>desc1</I> <I>...</I>))<DD>
Similar to the above, but with descriptions for each possible match.
Note the backslash before the colon.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>:foo:((a\:bar b\:baz</B><B>))</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The matches will be listed together with their descriptions if the
<B>description</B> style is set with the <B>values</B> tag in the context.
</DL>

<DT><B>-&gt;</B><I>string</I><DD>
In this form, <B>_arguments</B> processes the arguments and options and then
returns control to the calling function with parameters set to indicate the
state of processing; the calling function then makes its own arrangements
for generating completions.  For example, functions that implement a state
machine can use this type of action.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Where <B>_arguments</B> encounters a `<B>-&gt;</B><I>string</I>', it will strip
all leading and trailing whitespace from <I>string</I> and set the array
<B>state</B> to the set of all <I>strings</I>s for which an action is to be
performed.
<P>

By default and in common with all other well behaved completion
functions, _arguments returns zero if it was able to add matches and
non-zero otherwise. However, if the <B>-R</B> option is given,
<B>_arguments</B> will instead return a status of 300 to indicate that
<B>$state</B> is to be handled.
<P>

In addition to <B>$state</B>, <B>_arguments</B> also sets the global
parameters `<B>context</B>', `<B>line</B>' and `<B>opt_args</B>' as described
below, and does not reset any changes made to the special parameters
such as <B>PREFIX</B> and <B>words</B>.  This gives the calling function the
choice of resetting these parameters or propagating changes in them.
<P>

A function calling <B>_arguments</B> with at least
one action containing a `<B>-&gt;</B><I>string</I>' therefore must declare
appropriate local parameters:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>local context state line
typeset -A opt_args</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

to avoid <B>_arguments</B> from altering the global environment.
</DL>

<DT><B>{</B><I>eval-string</I><B>}</B><DD>
A string in braces is evaluated as shell code to generate matches.  If the
<I>eval-string</I> itself does not begin with an opening parenthesis or
brace it is split into separate words before execution.
<DT><B>= </B><I>action</I><DD>
If the <I>action</I> starts with `<B>= </B>' (an equals sign followed by a
space), <B>_arguments</B> will insert the contents of the <I>argument</I>
field of the current context as the new first element in the <B>words</B> 
special array and increment the value of the <B>CURRENT</B> special
parameter.  This has the effect of inserting a dummy word onto the
completion command line while not changing the point at which completion is
taking place.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This is most useful with one of the specifiers that restrict the words on
the command line on which the <I>action</I> is to operate (the two- and
three-colon forms above).  One particular use is when an <I>action</I> itself
causes <B>_arguments</B> on a restricted range; it is necessary to use this
trick to insert an appropriate command name into the range for the second
call to <B>_arguments</B> to be able to parse the line.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<BR>&nbsp;<I>word...</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>word...</I>
This covers all forms other than those above.  If the <I>action</I>
starts with a space, the remaining list of words will be invoked unchanged.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Otherwise it will be invoked with some extra strings placed after the
first word; these are to be passed down as options to the <B>compadd</B>
builtin.  They ensure that the state specified by <B>_arguments</B>, in
particular the descriptions of options and arguments, is correctly passed
to the completion command.  These additional arguments
are taken from the array parameter `<B>expl</B>'; this will be set up
before executing the <I>action</I> and hence may be referred to inside it,
typically in an expansion of the form `<B>$expl[@]</B>' which preserves empty
elements of the array.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

During the performance of the action the array `<B>line</B>'
will be set to the command name and normal arguments from the command
line, i.e. the words from the command line excluding all options
and their arguments.  Options are stored in the associative array
`<B>opt_args</B>' with option names as keys and their arguments as
the values.  For options that have more than one argument these are
given as one string, separated by colons.  All colons in the original
arguments are preceded with backslashes.
<P>

The parameter `<B>context</B>' is set when returning to the calling function
to perform an action of the form `<B>-&gt;</B><I>string</I>'.  It is set to an
array of elements corresponding to the elements of <B>$state</B>.  Each
element is a suitable name for the argument field of the context: either a
string of the form `<B>option</B><I>-opt</I><B>-</B><I>n</I>' for the <I>n</I>'th
argument of the option <I>-opt</I>, or a string of the form
`<B>argument-</B><I>n</I>' for the <I>n</I>'th argument.  For `rest' arguments,
that is those in the list at the end not handled by position, <I>n</I> is the
string `<B>rest</B>'.  For example, when completing the argument of the <B>-o</B>
option, the name is `<B>option-o-1</B>', while for the second normal
(non-option-) argument it is `<B>argument-2</B>'.
<P>

Furthermore, during the evaluation of the <I>action</I> the context name in
the <B>curcontext</B> parameter is altered to append the same string that is
stored in the <B>context</B> parameter.
<P>

It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and
arguments with the sets separated by single hyphens.  The specifications
before the first hyphen (if any) are shared by all the remaining sets.
The first word in every other set provides a name for the
set which may appear in exclusion lists in specifications,
either alone or before one of the possible values described above.
In the second case a `<B>-</B>' should appear between this name and the
remainder.
<P>

For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_arguments \ 
    -a \ 
  - set1 \ 
    -c \ 
  - set2 \ 
    -d \ 
    ':arg:(x2 y2)'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This defines two sets.  When the command line contains the option
`<B>-c</B>', the `<B>-d</B>' option and the argument will not be considered
possible completions.  When it contains `<B>-d</B>' or an argument, the
option `<B>-c</B>' will not be considered.  However, after `<B>-a</B>'
both sets will still be considered valid.
<P>

If the name given for one of the mutually exclusive sets is of the form
`<B>(</B><I>name</I><B>)</B>' then only one value from each set will ever
be completed; more formally, all specifications are mutually
exclusive to all other specifications in the same set.  This is
useful for defining multiple sets of options which are mutually
exclusive and in which the options are aliases for each other.  For
example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_arguments \ 
    -a -b \ 
  - '(compress)' \ 
    {-c,--compress}'[compress]' \ 
  - '(uncompress)' \ 
    {-d,--decompress}'[decompress]'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

As the completion code has to parse the command line separately for each
set this form of argument is slow and should only be used when necessary.
A useful alternative is often an option specification with rest-arguments
(as in `<B>-foo:*:...</B>'); here the option <B>-foo</B> swallows up all
remaining arguments as described by the <I>optarg</I> definitions.
<P>

The options <B>-S</B> and <B>-A</B> are available to simplify the specifications
for commands with standard option parsing.  With <B>-S</B>, no option will be
completed after a `<B>-</B><B>-</B>' appearing on its own on the line; this
argument will otherwise be ignored; hence in the line
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>foobar -a -- -b</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

the `<B>-a</B>' is considered an option but the `<B>-b</B>' is considered an
argument, while the `<B>-</B><B>-</B>' is considered to be neither.
<P>

With <B>-A</B>, no options will be completed after the first non-option
argument on the line.  The <B>-A</B> must be followed by a pattern matching
all strings which are not to be taken as arguments.  For example, to make
<B>_arguments</B> stop completing options after the first normal argument, but
ignoring all strings starting with a hyphen even if they are not described
by one of the <I>optspec</I>s, the form is `<B>-A &quot;-*&quot;</B>'.
<P>

The option `<B>-O</B> <I>name</I>' specifies the name of an array whose elements
will be passed as arguments to functions called to execute <I>actions</I>.
For example, this can be used to pass the same set of options for the
<B>compadd</B> builtin to all <I>action</I>s.
<P>

The option `<B>-M</B> <I>spec</I>' sets a match specification to use to
completion option names and values.  It must appear before the first
argument specification.  The default is `<B>r:|[_-]=* r:|=*</B>': this allows
partial word completion after `<B>_</B>' and `<B>-</B>', for example `-f-b'
can be completed to `<B>-foo-bar</B>'.
<P>

The option <B>-C</B> tells <B>_arguments</B> to modify
the <B>curcontext</B> parameter for an action of the form
`<B>-&gt;</B><I>state</I>'.  This is the standard parameter used to keep track of
the current context.  Here it (and not the <B>context</B> array) should be
made local to the calling function
to avoid passing back the modified value and should be initialised to the
current value at the start of the function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>local curcontext=&quot;$curcontext&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This is useful where it is not possible for multiple states to be valid
together.
<P>

The option `<B>--</B>' allows <B>_arguments</B> to work out the names of long
options that support the `<B>-</B><B>-help</B>' option which is standard in many
GNU commands.  The command word is called with the argument
`<B>-</B><B>-help</B>' and the output examined for option names.  Clearly, it can
be dangerous to pass this to commands which may not support this option as
the behaviour of the command is unspecified.
<P>

In addition to options, `<B>_arguments -</B><B>-</B>' will try to deduce the
types of arguments available for options when the form
`<B>-</B><B>-</B><I>opt</I>=<I>val</I>' is valid.  It is also possible to provide
hints by examining the help text of the command and adding specifiers of
the form `<I>pattern</I><B>:</B><I>message</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>'; note that normal
<B>_arguments</B> specifiers are not used.  The <I>pattern</I> is matched
against the help text for an option, and if it matches the <I>message</I> and
<I>action</I> are used as for other argument specifiers.  For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_arguments -- '*\*:toggle:(yes no)' \ 
              '*=FILE*:file:_files' \ 
              '*=DIR*:directory:_files -/' \ 
              '*=PATH*:directory:_files -/'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Here, `<B>yes</B>' and `<B>no</B>' will be completed as the argument of
options whose description ends in a star; file names will be completed for
options that contain the substring `<B>=FILE</B>' in the description; and
directories will be completed for options whose description contains
`<B>=DIR</B>' or `<B>=PATH</B>'.  The last three are in fact the default and so
need not be given explicitly, although it is possible to override the use
of these patterns.  A typical help text which uses this feature is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>  -C, --directory=DIR          change to directory DIR</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

so that the above specifications will cause directories to be completed
after `<B>--directory</B>', though not after `<B>-C</B>'.
<P>

Note also that <B>_arguments</B> tries to find out automatically if the
argument for an option is optional.  This can be specified explicitly by
doubling the colon before the <I>message</I>.
<P>

If the <I>pattern</I> ends in `<B>(-)</B>', this will removed from the
pattern and the <I>action</I> will be used only directly after the
`<B>=</B>', not in the next word.  This is the behaviour of a normal
specification defined with the form `<B>=-</B>'.
<P>

The `<B>_arguments -</B><B>-</B>' can be followed by the option `<B>-i</B>
<I>patterns</I>' to give patterns for options which are not to be
completed.  The patterns can be given as the name of an array parameter
or as a literal list in parentheses.  For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_arguments -- -i \ 
    &quot;(--(en|dis)able-FEATURE*)&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will cause completion to ignore the options
`<B>-</B><B>-enable-FEATURE</B>' and `<B>-</B><B>-disable-FEATURE</B>' (this example is
useful with GNU <B>configure</B>).
<P>

The `<B>_arguments -</B><B>-</B>' form can also be followed by the option `<B>-s</B>
<I>pair</I>' to describe option aliases.  Each <I>pair</I> consists of a
pattern and a replacement.  For example, some <B>configure</B>-scripts
describe options only as `<B>-</B><B>-enable-foo</B>', but also accept
`<B>-</B><B>-disable-foo</B>'.  To allow completion of the second form:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_arguments -- -s &quot;(#--enable- -</B><B>-disable-)&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Here is a more general example of the use of <B>_arguments</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_arguments '-l+:left border:' \ 
           '-format:paper size:(letter A4)' \ 
           '*-copy:output file:_files::resolution:(300 600)' \ 
           ':postscript file:_files -g \*.\(ps\|eps\)' \ 
           '*:page number:'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This describes three options: `<B>-l</B>', `<B>-format</B>', and
`<B>-copy</B>'.  The first takes one argument described as `<I>left
border</I>' for which no completion will be offered because of the empty
action.  Its argument may come directly after the `<B>-l</B>' or it may be 
given as the next word on the line.
<P>

The `<B>-format</B>' option takes one
argument in the next word, described as `<I>paper size</I>' for which
only the strings `<B>letter</B>' and `<B>A4</B>' will be completed.
<P>

The `<B>-copy</B>' option may appear more than once on the command line and
takes two arguments.  The first is mandatory and will be completed as a
filename.  The second is optional (because of the second colon before
the description `<I>resolution</I>') and will be completed from the strings
`<B>300</B>' and `<B>600</B>'.
<P>

The last two descriptions say what should be completed as
arguments.  The first describes the first argument as a
`<I>postscript file</I>' and makes files ending in `<B>ps</B>' or `<B>eps</B>' 
be completed.  The last description gives all other arguments the
description `<I>page numbers</I>' but does not offer completions.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>_cache_invalid</B> <I>cache_identifier</I><DD>
This function returns status zero if the completions cache corresponding to
the given cache identifier needs rebuilding.  It determines this by
looking up the <B>cache-policy</B> style for the current context.
This should provide a function name which is run with the full path to the
relevant cache file as the only argument.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_example_caching_policy () {
    # rebuild if cache is more than a week old
    oldp=( &quot;$1&quot;(Nmw+1) )
    (( $#oldp ))
}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>_call_function</B> <I>return</I> <I>name</I> [ <I>args</I> ... ]<DD>
If a function <I>name</I> exists, it is called with the arguments
<I>args</I>.  The <I>return</I> argument gives the name of a parameter in which
the return status from the function <I>name</I>; if <I>return</I> is empty or a
single hyphen it is ignored.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The return value of <B>_call_function</B> itself is zero if the function
<I>name</I> exists and was called and non-zero otherwise.
</DL>

<DT><B>_call_program</B> <I>tag</I> <I>string</I> ...<DD>
This function provides a mechanism for the user to override the use of an
external command.  It looks up the <B>command</B> style with the supplied
<I>tag</I>.  If the style is set, its value is used as the command to
execute.  The <I>string</I>s from the call to <B>_call_program</B>, or from the
style if set, are concatenated with spaces between them and the resulting
string is evaluated.  The return value is the return value of the command
called.
<DT><B>_combination</B> [ <B>-s</B> <I>pattern</I> ] <I>tag</I> <I>style</I> <I>spec</I> ... <I>field</I> <I>opts</I> ...<DD>
This function is used to complete combinations of values,  for example
pairs of hostnames and usernames.  The <I>style</I> argument gives the style
which defines the pairs; it is looked up in a context with the <I>tag</I>
specified.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The style name consists of field names separated by hyphens, for example
`<B>users-hosts-ports</B>'.  For each field for a value is already known, a
<I>spec</I> of the form `<I>field</I><B>=</B><I>pattern</I>' is given.  For example,
if the command line so far specifies a user `<B>pws</B>', the argument
`<B>users=pws</B>' should appear.
<P>

The next argument with no equals sign is taken as the name of the field
for which completions should be generated (presumably not one of the
<I>field</I>s for which the value is known).
<P>

The matches generated will be taken from the value of the style.  These
should contain the possible values for the combinations in the appropriate
order (users, hosts, ports in the example above).  The different fields
the values for the different fields are separated by colons.  This
can be altered with the option <B>-s</B> to <B>_combination</B> which specifies a
pattern.  Typically this is a character class, as for example
`<B>-s &quot;[:@]&quot;</B>' in the case of the <B>users-hosts</B> style.    Each
`<I>field</I><B>=</B><I>pattern</I>' specification restricts the
completions which apply to elements of the style with appropriately
matching fields.
<P>

If no style with the given name is defined for the given tag,
or if none of the strings in style's value match, but a
function name of the required field preceded by an
underscore is defined, that function will be called to generate the
matches.  For example, if there is no `<B>users-hosts-ports</B>' or no
matching hostname when a host is required, the function `<B>_hosts</B>' will
automatically be called.
<P>

If the same name is used for more than one field, in both the
`<I>field</I><B>=</B><I>pattern</I>' and the argument that gives the name of the
field to be completed, the number of the field (starting with one) may
be given after the fieldname, separated from it by a colon.
<P>

All arguments after the required field name are passed to
<B>compadd</B> when generating matches from the style value, or to 
the functions for the fields if they are called.
</DL>

<DT><B>_describe</B> [ <B>-oO</B> | <B>-t</B> <I>tag</I> ] <I>descr</I> <I>name1</I> [ <I>name2</I> ] <I>opts</I> ... <B>-</B><B>-</B> ...<DD>
This function associates completions with descriptions.
Multiple groups separated by <B>-</B><B>-</B> can be supplied, potentially with
different completion options <I>opts</I>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>descr</I> is taken as a string to display above the matches if the
<B>format</B> style for the <B>descriptions</B> tag is set.  This is followed by
one or two names of arrays followed by options to pass to <B>compadd</B>.  The
first array contains the possible completions with their descriptions in
the form `<I>completion</I><B>:</B><I>description</I>'.  If a second array is
given, it should have the same number of elements as the first; in this
case the corresponding elements are added as possible completions instead
of the <I>completion</I> strings from the first array.  The completion list
will retain the descriptions from the first array.  Finally, a set of
completion options can appear.
<P>

If the option `<B>-o</B>' appears before the first argument, the matches added
will be treated as names of command options (N.B. not shell options),
typically following a `<B>-</B>', `<B>-</B><B>-</B>' or `<B>+</B>' on the command
line.  In this case <B>_describe</B> uses the <B>prefix-hidden</B>,
<B>prefix-needed</B> and <B>verbose</B> styles to find out if the strings should
be added as completions and if the descriptions should be shown.  Without
the `<B>-o</B>' option, only the <B>verbose</B> style is used to decide how
descriptions are shown.  If `<B>-O</B>' is used instead of `<B>-O</B>', command
options are completed as above but <B>_describe</B> will not handle the
<B>prefix-needed</B> style.
<P>

With the <B>-t</B> option a <I>tag</I> can be specified.  The default is
`<B>values</B>' or, if the <B>-o</B> option is given, `<B>options</B>'.
<P>

If selected by the <B>list-grouped</B> style, strings with the same
description will appear together in the list.
<P>

<B>_describe</B> uses the <B>_all_labels</B> function to generate the matches, so
it does not need to appear inside a loop over tag labels.
</DL>

<DT><B>_description</B> [ <B>-x</B> ] [ <B>-12VJ</B> ] <I>tag</I> <I>name</I> <I>descr</I> [ <I>spec</I> ... ]<DD>
This function is not to be confused with the previous one; it is used as
a helper function for creating options to <B>compadd</B>.  It is buried
inside many of the higher level completion functions and so often does
not need to be called directly.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The styles listed below are tested in the current context using the
given <I>tag</I>.  The resulting options for <B>compadd</B> are put into the
array named <I>name</I> (this is traditionally `<B>expl</B>', but this
convention is not enforced).  The description for the corresponding set
of matches is passed to the function in <I>descr</I>.
<P>

The styles tested are: <B>format</B>, <B>hidden</B>, <B>matcher</B>,
<B>ignored-patterns</B> and <B>group-name</B>.  The <B>format</B> style is first
tested for the given <I>tag</I> and then for the <B>descriptions</B> tag if
no value was found, while the remainder are only tested for the tag
given as the first argument.  The function also calls <B>_setup</B>
which tests some more styles.
<P>

The string returned by the <B>format</B> style (if any) will be modified so
that the sequence `<B>%d</B>' is replaced by the <I>descr</I> given as the third
argument without any leading or trailing white space.  If, after
removing the white space, the <I>descr</I> is the empty string, the format
style will not be used and the options put into the <I>name</I> array will
not contain an explanation string to be displayed above the matches.
<P>

If <B>_description</B> is called with more than three arguments,
the additional <I>spec</I>s should be of the form `<I>char</I><B>:</B><I>str</I>'.
These supply escape sequence replacements for the <B>format</B> style:
every appearance of `<B>%</B><I>char</I>' will be
replaced by <I>string</I>.
<P>

If the <B>-x</B> option is given, the description will be passed to
<B>compadd</B> using the <B>-x</B> option instead of the default <B>-X</B>.  This
means that the description will be displayed even if there are no
corresponding matches.
<P>

The options placed in the array <I>name</I> take account of the
<B>group-name</B> style, so matches are placed in a separate group where
necessary.  The group normally has its elements sorted (by passing the
option <B>-J</B> to <B>compadd</B>), but if an option starting with `<B>-V</B>',
`<B>-J</B>', `<B>-1</B>', or `<B>-2</B>' is passed to <B>_description</B>, that
option will be included in the array.  Hence it is possible for the
completion group to be unsorted by giving the option `<B>-V</B>',
`<B>-1V</B>', or `<B>-2V</B>'.
<P>

In most cases, the function will be used like this:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>local expl
_description files expl file
compadd &quot;$expl[@]&quot; - &quot;$files[@]&quot;</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Note the use of the parameter <B>expl</B>, the hyphen, and the list of
matches.  Almost all calls to <B>compadd</B> within the completion system use
a similar format; this ensures that user-specified styles are correctly
passed down to the builtins which implement the internals of completion.
</DL>

<DT><B>_dispatch</B> <I>context string ...</I><DD>
This sets the current context to <I>context</I> and looks for completion
functions to handle this context by hunting through the list of command
names or special contexts (as described above for <B>compdef</B>)
given as <I>string ...</I>.  The first completion function to be defined
for one of the contexts in the list is used to generate matches.
Typically, the last <I>string</I> is <B>-default-</B> to cause the function
for default completion to be used as a fallback.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The function sets the parameter
<B>$service</B> to the <I>string</I> being tried, and sets
the <I>context/command</I> field (the fourth) of the <B>$curcontext</B>
parameter to the <I>context</I> given as the first argument.
</DL>

<DT><B>_files</B><DD>
The function <B>_files</B> calls <B>_path_files</B> with all the arguments it
was passed except for <B>-g</B> and <B>-/</B>.  The use of these two options
depends on the setting of the  <B>file-patterns</B> style.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This function accepts the full set of options allowed by
<B>_path_files</B>, described below.
</DL>

<DT><B>_gnu_generic</B><DD>
This function is a simple wrapper around the <B>_arguments</B> function
described above.  It can be used to determine automatically the long
options understood by commands that produce a list when passed the
option `<B>-</B><B>-help</B>'.  It is intended to be used as a top-level
completion function in its own right.  For example, to enable option
completion for the commands <B>foo</B> and <B>bar</B>, use
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compdef _gnu_generic foo bar</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

after the call to <B>compinit</B>.
<P>

The completion system as supplied is conservative in its use of this
function, since it is important to be sure the command understands the
option `<B>-</B>'<B>-help</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>_guard</B> [ <I>options</I> ] <I>pattern descr</I><DD>
This function is intended to be used in the <I>action</I> for
the specifications passed to <B>_arguments</B> and similar functions.  It
returns immediately with a non-zero return value if
the string to be completed does not match the <I>pattern</I>.  If the
pattern matches, the <I>descr</I> is displayed; the function then returns
zero if the word to complete is not empty, non-zero otherwise.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>pattern</I> may be preceded by any of the options understood by
<B>compadd</B> that are passed down from <B>_description</B>, namely <B>-M</B>,
<B>-J</B>, <B>-V</B>, <B>-1</B>, <B>-2</B>, <B>-n</B>, <B>-F</B> and <B>-X</B>.  All of these
options will be ignored.  This fits in conveniently with the
argument-passing conventions of actions for <B>_arguments</B>.
<P>

As an example, consider a command taking the options <B>-n</B> and
<B>-none</B>, where <B>-n</B> must be followed by a numeric value in the
same word.  By using:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_arguments '-n-: :_guard &quot;[0-9]#&quot; &quot;numeric value&quot;' '-none'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<B>_arguments</B> can be made to both display the message `<B>numeric
value</B>' and complete options after `<B>-n&lt;TAB&gt;</B>'.  If the `<B>-n</B>' is
already followed by one or more digits (the pattern passed to
<B>_guard</B>) only the message will be displayed; if the `<B>-n</B>' is
followed by another character, only options are completed.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>_message</B> [ <B>-r12</B> ] [ <B>-VJ</B> <I>group</I> ] <I>descr</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>_message -e</B> [ <I>tag</I> ] <I>descr</I>
The <I>descr</I> is used in the same way as the third
argument to the <B>_description</B> function, except that the resulting
string will always be shown whether or not matches were
generated.  This is useful for displaying a help message in places where
no completions can be generated.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>format</B> style is examined with the <B>messages</B> tag to find a
message; the usual tag, <B>descriptions</B>, is used only if the style is
not set with the former.
<P>

If the <B>-r</B> option is given, no style is used; the <I>descr</I> is
taken literally as the string to display.  This is most useful
when the <I>descr</I> comes from a pre-processed argument list
which already contains an expanded description.
<P>

The <B>-12VJ</B> options and the <I>group</I> are passed to <B>compadd</B> and
hence determine the group the message string is added to.
<P>

The second form gives a description for completions with the tag
<I>tag</I> to be shown even if there are no matches for that tag.  The tag
can be omitted and if so the tag is taken from the parameter
<B>$curtag</B>; this is maintained by the completion system and so is
usually correct.
</DL>

<DT><B>_multi_parts</B> <I>sep</I> <I>array</I><DD>
The argument <I>sep</I> is a separator character.
The <I>array</I> may be either the
name of an array parameter or a literal array in the form
`<B>(foo bar</B><B>)</B>', a parenthesised list of words separated
by whitespace.  The possible completions are the
strings from the array.  However, each chunk delimited by <I>sep</I> will be
completed separately.  For example, the <B>_tar</B> function uses
`<B>_multi_parts</B> <B>/</B> <I>patharray</I>' to complete partial file paths
from the given array of complete file paths.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>-i</B> option causes <B>_multi_parts</B> to insert a unique match even
if that requires multiple separators to be inserted.  This is not usually
the expected behaviour with filenames, but certain other types of
completion, for example those with a fixed set of possibilities, may be
more suited to this form.
<P>

Like other utility functions, this function accepts the `<B>-V</B>',
`<B>-J</B>', `<B>-1</B>', `<B>-2</B>', `<B>-n</B>', `<B>-f</B>', `<B>-X</B>', `<B>-M</B>',
`<B>-P</B>', `<B>-S</B>', `<B>-r</B>', `<B>-R</B>', and `<B>-q</B>' options and passes
them to the <B>compadd</B> builtin.
</DL>

<DT><B>_next_label</B> [ <B>-x</B> ] [ <B>-12VJ</B> ] <I>tag</I> <I>name</I> <I>descr</I> [ <I>options</I> ... ]<DD>
This function is used to implement the loop over different tag
labels for a particular tag as described above for the <B>tag-order</B>
style.  On each call it checks to see if there are any more tag labels; if
there is it returns status zero, otherwise non-zero.
As this function requires a current tag to be set, it must always follow
a call to <B>_tags</B> or <B>_requested</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>-x12VJ</B> options and the first three arguments are passed to the
<B>_description</B> function.  Where appropriate the <I>tag</I> will be
replaced by a tag label in this call.  Any description given in
the <B>tag-order</B> style is preferred to the <I>descr</I> passed to
<B>_next_label</B>.
<P>

The <I>options</I> given after the <I>descr</I>
are set in the parameter given by <I>name</I>, and hence are to be passed
to <B>compadd</B> or whatever function is called to add the matches.
<P>

Here is a typical use of this function for the tag <B>foo</B>.  The call to
<B>_requested</B> determines if tag <B>foo</B> is required at all; the loop
over <B>_next_label</B> handles any labels defined for the tag in the
<B>tag-order</B> style.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>_normal</B><DD>
This is the standard function called to handle completion outside
any special <I>-context-</I>.  It is called both to complete the command
word and also the arguments for a command.  In the second case,
<B>_normal</B> looks for a special completion for that command, and if
there is none it uses the completion for the <B>-default-</B> context.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

A second use is to reexamine the command line specified by the <B>$words</B>
array and the <B>$CURRENT</B> parameter after those have been modified.
For example, the function <B>_precommand</B>, which
completes after pre-command specifiers such as <B>nohup</B>, removes the
first word from the <B>words</B> array, decrements the <B>CURRENT</B> parameter,
then calls <B>_normal</B> again.  The effect is that `<B>nohup</B> <I>cmd ...</I>'
is treated in the same way as `<I>cmd ...</I>'.
<P>

If the command name matches one of the patterns given by one of the
options <B>-p</B> or <B>-P</B> to <B>compdef</B>, the corresponding completion
function is called and then the parameter <B>_compskip</B> is
checked.  If it is set completion is terminated at that point even if
no matches have been found.  This is the same effect as in the
<B>-first-</B> context.
</DL>

<DT><B>_options</B><DD>
This can be used to complete the names of shell options.  It provides a
matcher specification that ignores a leading `<B>no</B>', ignores
underscores and allows upper-case letters to
match their lower-case counterparts (for example, `<B>glob</B>',
`<B>noglob</B>', `<B>NO_GLOB</B>' are all completed).  Any arguments
are propagated to the <B>compadd</B> builtin.
<DT><B>_options_set</B> and <B>_options_unset</B><DD>
These functions complete only set or unset options, with the same
matching specification used in the <B>_options</B> function.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that you need to uncomment a few lines in the <B>_main_complete</B>
function for these functions to work properly.  The lines in question
are used to store the option settings in effect before the completion
widget locally sets the options it needs.  Hence these functions are not
generally used by the completion system.
</DL>

<DT><B>_parameters</B><DD>
This is used to complete the names of shell parameters.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The option `<B>-g </B><I>pattern</I>' limits the completion to parameters
whose type matches the <I>pattern</I>.  The type of a parameter is that
shown by `<B>print ${(t)</B><I>param</I><B>}</B>', hence judicious use of
`<B>*</B>' in <I>pattern</I> is probably necessary.
<P>

All other arguments are passed to the <B>compadd</B> builtin.
</DL>

<DT><B>_path_files</B><DD>
This function is used throughout the completion system
to complete filenames.  It allows completion of partial paths.  For
example, the string `<B>/u/i/s/sig</B>' may be completed to
`<B>/usr/include/sys/signal.h</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The options accepted by both <B>_path_files</B> and <B>_files</B> are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-f</B>
Complete all filenames.  This is the default.
<DT><B>-/</B><DD>
Specifies that only directories should be completed.
<DT><B>-g</B> <I>pattern</I><DD>
Specifies that only files matching the <I>pattern</I> should be completed.
<DT><B>-W</B> <I>paths</I><DD>
Specifies path prefixes that are to be prepended to the string from the
command line to generate the filenames but that should not be inserted
as completions nor shown in completion listings.  Here, <I>paths</I> may be
the name of an array parameter, a literal list of paths enclosed in
parentheses or an absolute pathname.
<DT><B>-F</B> <I>ignored-files</I><DD>
This behaves as for the corresponding option to the <B>compadd</B> builtin.
It gives direct control over which
filenames should be ignored.  If the option is not present, the
<B>ignored-patterns</B> style is used.
</DL>
<P>

Both <B>_path_files</B> and <B>_files</B> also accept the following options
which are passed to <B>compadd</B>: `<B>-J</B>', `<B>-V</B>',
`<B>-1</B>', `<B>-2</B>', `<B>-n</B>', `<B>-X</B>', `<B>-M</B>', `<B>-P</B>', `<B>-S</B>',
`<B>-q</B>', `<B>-r</B>', and `<B>-R</B>'.
<P>

Finally, the <B>_path_files</B> function  uses the styles <B>expand</B>,
<B>ambiguous</B>, <B>special-dirs</B>, <B>list-suffixes</B> and <B>file-sort</B>
described above.
</DL>

<DT><B>_pick_variant [ -c</B> <I>command</I> ] [ <B>-r</B> <I>name</I> ] <I>label</I><B>=</B><I>pattern</I> ... <I>label</I> [ <I>args</I> ... ]<DD>
This function is used to resolve situations where a single command name
requires more than one type of handling, either because it
has more than one variant or because there is a name clash between two
different commands.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The command to run is taken from the first element of the array
<B>words</B> unless this is overridden by the option <B>-c</B>.  This command
is run and its output is compared with a series of patterns.  Arguments
to be passed to the command can be specified at the end after all the
other arguments.  The patterns to try in order are given by the arguments
<I>label</I><B>=</B><I>pattern</I>; if the output of `<I>command</I> <I>args</I>
<B>...</B>' contains <I>pattern</I>, then <B>label</B> is selected as the label
for the command variant.  If none of the patterns match, the final
command label is selected and status 1 is returned.
<P>

If the `<B>-r</B> <I>name</I>' is given, the <I>label</I> picked is stored in
the parameter named <I>name</I>.
<P>

The results are also cached in the <I>_cmd_variant</I> associative array
indexed by the name of the command run.
</DL>

<DT><B>_regex_arguments</B> <I>name</I> <I>spec</I> ...<DD>
This function generates a completion function <I>name</I> which matches
the specifications <I>spec</I> <B>...</B>, a set of regular expressions as
described below.  After running <B>_regex_arguments</B>, the function
<I>name</I> should be called at the appropriate point.
The pattern to be matched is given by the contents of
the <B>words</B> array up to the current cursor position joined together
with null characters; no quotation is applied.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The arguments are grouped as sets of alternatives separated by `<B>|</B>',
which are tried one after the other until one matches.  Each alternative
consists of a one or more specifications which are tried left to right,
with each pattern matched being stripped in turn from the command line
being tested, until all of the group succeeds or until one fails; in the
latter case, the next alternative is tried.  This structure can be
repeated to arbitrary depth by using parentheses; matching proceeds from
inside to outside.
<P>

A special procedure is applied if no test succeeds but the remaining
command line string contains no null character (implying the remaining
word is the one for which completions are to be generated).  The
completion target is restricted to the remaining word and any
<I>action</I>s for the corresponding patterns are executed.  In this case,
nothing is stripped from the command line string.  The order of
evaluation of the <I>action</I>s can be determined by the <B>tag-order</B>
style; the various formats supported by <B>_alternative</B> can be used
in <I>action</I>.  The <I>descr</I> is used for setting up the array
parameter <B>expl</B>.
<P>

Specification arguments take one of following forms, in which
metacharacters such as `<B>(</B>', `<B>)</B>', `<B>#</B>' and `<B>|</B>'
should be quoted.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>

<B>/</B><I>pattern</I><B>/</B> [<B>%</B><I>lookahead</I><B>%</B>] [<B>-</B><I>guard</I>] [<B>:</B><I>tag</I><B>:</B><I>descr</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>]
This is a single primitive component.
The function tests whether the combined pattern
`<B>(#b)((#B)</B><I>pattern</I><B>)</B><I>lookahead</I><B>*</B>' matches
the command line string.  If so, `<I>guard</I>' is evaluated and
its return status is examined to determine if the test has succeeded.
The <I>pattern</I> string `<B>[]</B>' is guaranteed never to match.
The <I>lookahead</I> is not stripped from the command line before the next
pattern is examined.
<DT><B>/</B><I>pattern</I><B>/+</B> [<B>%</B><I>lookahead</I><B>%</B>] [<B>-</B><I>guard</I>] [<B>:</B><I>tag</I><B>:</B><I>descr</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>]<DD>
This is similar to `<B>/</B><I>pattern</I><B>/</B> ...' but the left part of the
command line string (i.e. the part already matched by previous patterns)
is also considered part of the completion target.
<DT><B>/</B><I>pattern</I><B>/-</B> [<B>%</B><I>lookahead</I><B>%</B>] [<B>-</B><I>guard</I>] [<B>:</B><I>tag</I><B>:</B><I>descr</I><B>:</B><I>action</I>]<DD>
This is similar to `<B>/</B><I>pattern</I><B>/</B> ...' but the <I>action</I>s of the
current and previously matched patterns are ignored even if the
following `<I>pattern</I>' matches the empty string.
<DT><B>(</B> <I>spec</I> <B>)</B><DD>
Parentheses may be used to groups <I>spec</I>s; note each parenthesis
is a single argument to <B>_regex_arguments</B>.
<DT><I>spec</I> <B>#</B><DD>
This allows any number of repetitions of <I>spec</I>.
<DT><I>spec</I> <I>spec</I><DD>
The two <I>spec</I>s are to be matched one after the other as described
above.
<DT><I>spec</I> <B>|</B> <I>spec</I><DD>
Either of the two <I>spec</I>s can be matched.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>_requested</B> [ <B>-x</B> ] [ <B>-12VJ</B> ] <I>tag</I> [ <I>name</I> <I>descr</I> [ <I>command</I> <I>args</I> ... ] ]<DD>
This function is called to decide whether a tag already registered by a
call to <B>_tags</B> (see below) has been requested by the user and hence
completion should be performed for it.  It returns status zero if the
tag is requested and non-zero otherwise.  The function is typically used
as part of a loop over different tags as follows:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_tags foo bar baz
while _tags; do
  if _requested foo; then
    ... # perform completion for foo
  fi
  ... # test the tags bar and baz in the same way
  ... # exit loop if matches were generated
done</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Note that the test for whether matches were generated is not performed
until the end of the <B>_tags</B> loop.  This is so that the user can set
the <B>tag-order</B> style to specify a set of tags to be completed at the
same time.
<P>

If <I>name</I> and <I>descr</I> are given, <B>_requested</B> calls the
<B>_description</B> function with these arguments together with the options
passed to <B>_requested</B>.
<P>

If <I>command</I> is given, the <B>_all_labels</B> function will be called
immediately with the same arguments.  In simple cases this makes it
possible to perform the test for the tag and the matching in one go.
For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>local expl ret=1
_tags foo bar baz
while _tags; do
  _requested foo expl 'description' \ 
      compadd foobar foobaz &amp;&amp; ret=0
  ...
  (( ret )) || break
done</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

If the <I>command</I> is not <B>compadd</B>, it must nevertheless be prepared
to handle the same options.
</DL>

<DT><B>_retrieve_cache</B> <I>cache_identifier</I><DD>
This function retrieves completion information from the file given by
<I>cache_identifier</I>, stored in a directory specified by the
<B>cache-path</B> style which defaults to <B>~/.zsh/cache</B>.  The return value
is zero if retrieval was successful.  It will only attempt retrieval
if the <B>use-cache</B> style is set, so you can call this function
without worrying about whether the user wanted to use the caching
layer.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

See <B>_store_cache</B> below for more details.
</DL>

<DT><B>_sep_parts</B><DD>
This function is passed alternating arrays and separators as arguments.
The arrays specify completions for parts of strings to be separated by the
separators.  The arrays may be the names of array parameters or
a quoted list of words in parentheses.  For example, with the array
`<B>hosts=(ftp news)</B>' the call `<B>_sep_parts '(foo bar)' @ hosts</B>' will
complete the string  `<B>f</B>' to `<B>foo</B>' and the string `<B>b@n</B>' to
`<B><A HREF="mailto:bar@news">bar@news</A></B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This function accepts the <B>compadd</B> options `<B>-V</B>', `<B>-J</B>',
`<B>-1</B>', `<B>-2</B>', `<B>-n</B>', `<B>-X</B>', `<B>-M</B>', `<B>-P</B>', `<B>-S</B>',
`<B>-r</B>', `<B>-R</B>', and `<B>-q</B>' and passes them on to the <B>compadd</B>
builtin used to add the matches.
</DL>

<DT><B>_setup</B> <I>tag</I> [ <I>group</I> ]<DD>
This function sets up the special
parameters used by the completion system appropriately for the <I>tag</I>
given as the first argument.  It uses the styles <B>list-colors</B>,
<B>list-packed</B>, <B>list-rows-first</B>, <B>last-prompt</B>, <B>accept-exact</B>,
<B>menu</B> and <B>force-list</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The optional <I>group</I> supplies the name of the group in which the
matches will be placed.  If it is not given, the <I>tag</I> is used as
the group name.
<P>

This function is called automatically from <B>_description</B>
and hence is not normally called explicitly.
</DL>

<DT><B>_store_cache</B> <I>cache_identifier</I> <I>params</I> ...<DD>
This function, together with <B>_retrieve_cache</B> and
<B>_cache_invalid</B>, implements a caching layer which can be used
in any completion function.  Data obtained by
costly operations are stored in parameters;
this function then dumps the values of those parameters to a file.  The
data can then be retrieved quickly from that file via <B>_retrieve_cache</B>,
even in different instances of the shell.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>cache_identifier</I> specifies the file which the data should be
dumped to.  The file is stored in a directory specified by the
<B>cache-path</B> style which defaults to <B>~/.zsh/cache</B>.  The remaining
<I>params</I> arguments are the parameters to dump to the file.
<P>

The return value is zero if storage was successful.  The function will
only attempt storage if the <B>use-cache</B> style is set, so you can
call this function without worrying about whether the user wanted to
use the caching layer.
<P>

The completion function may avoid calling <B>_retrieve_cache</B> when it
already has the completion data available as parameters. 
However, in that case it should
call <B>_cache_invalid</B> to check whether the data in the parameters and
in the cache are still valid.
<P>

See the _perl_modules completion function for a simple example of
the usage of the caching layer.
</DL>

<DT><B>_tags</B> [ [ <B>-C</B> <I>name</I> ] <I>tags</I> ... ]<DD>
If called with arguments, these are taken to be the names of tags
valid for completions in the current context.  These tags are stored
internally and sorted by using the <B>tag-order</B> style.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Next, <B>_tags</B> is called repeatedly without arguments from the same
completion function.  This successively selects the first, second,
etc. set of tags requested by the user.  The return value is zero if at
least one of the tags is requested and non-zero otherwise.  To test if a
particular tag is to be tried, the <B>_requested</B> function should be
called (see above).
<P>

If `<B>-C</B> <I>name</I>' is given, <I>name</I> is temporarily stored in the
argument field (the fifth) of the context in the <B>curcontext</B> parameter
during the call to <B>_tags</B>; the field is restored on exit.  This
allows <B>_tags</B> to use a more 
specific context without having to change and reset the
<B>curcontext</B> parameter (which has the same effect).
</DL>

<DT><B>_values</B> [ <B>-O</B> <I>name</I> ] [ <B>-s</B> <I>sep</I> ] [ <B>-S</B> <I>sep</I> ] [ <B>-wC</B> ] <I>desc</I> <I>spec</I> ...<DD>
This is used to complete arbitrary keywords (values) and their arguments,
or lists of such combinations.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the first argument is the option `<B>-O</B> <I>name</I>', it will be used
in the same way as by the <B>_arguments</B> function.  In other words, the
elements of the <I>name</I> array will be passed to <B>compadd</B>
when executing an action.
<P>

If the first argument (or the first argument after `<B>-O</B> <I>name</I>')
is `<B>-s</B>', the next argument is used as the character that separates
multiple values.  This character is automatically added after each value
in an auto-removable fashion (see below); all values completed by
`<B>_values -s</B>' appear in the same word on the command line, unlike
completion using <B>_arguments</B>.  If this option is not present, only a
single value will be completed per word.
<P>

Normally, <B>_values</B> will only use the current word to determine
which values are already present on the command line and hence are not
to be completed again.  If the <B>-w</B> option is given, other arguments
are examined as well.
<P>

The first non-option argument is used as a string to print as a
description before listing the values.
<P>

All other arguments describe the possible values and their
arguments in the same format used for the description of options by
the <B>_arguments</B> function (see above).  The only differences are that
no minus or plus sign is required at the beginning,
values can have only one argument, and the forms of action
beginning with an equal sign are not supported.
<P>

The character separating a value from its argument can be set using the
option <B>-S</B> (like <B>-s</B>, followed by the character to use as the
separator in the next argument).  By default the equals
sign will be used as the separator between values and arguments.
<P>

Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_values -s , 'description' \ 
        '*foo[bar]' \ 
        '(two)*one[number]:first count:' \ 
        'two[another number]::second count:(1 2 3)'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This describes three possible values: `<B>foo</B>', `<B>one</B>', and
`<B>two</B>'.  The first is described as `<B>bar</B>', takes no argument 
and may appear more than once.  The second is described as
`<B>number</B>', may appear more than once, and takes one mandatory
argument described as `<B>first count</B>'; no action is
specified, so it will not be completed.  The
`<B>(two)</B>' at the beginning says that if the value `<B>one</B>' is on
the line, the value `<B>two</B>' will no longer be considered a possible
completion.  Finally, the last value (`<B>two</B>') is described
as `<B>another number</B>' and takes an optional argument described as
`<B>second count</B>' for which the completions (to appear after an
`<B>=</B>') are `<B>1</B>', `<B>2</B>', and `<B>3</B>'.  The <B>_values</B> function
will complete lists of these values separated by commas.
<P>

Like <B>_arguments</B>, this function temporarily adds another context name
component to the arguments element (the fifth) of the current context
while executing the <I>action</I>.  Here this name is just the name of the
value for which the argument is completed.
<P>

The style <B>verbose</B> is used to decide if the descriptions for the
values (but not those for the arguments) should be printed.
<P>

The associative array <B>val_args</B> is used to report values and their
arguments; this works similarly to the <B>opt_args</B> associative array
used by <B>_arguments</B>.  Hence the function calling <B>_values</B> should
declare the local parameters <B>state</B>, <B>line</B>, <B>context</B> and
<B>val_args</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>local context state line
typeset -A val_args</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

when using an action of the form `<B>-&gt;</B><I>string</I>'.  With this
function the <B>context</B> parameter will be set to the name of the
value whose argument is to be completed.
<P>

Note also that <B>_values</B> normally adds the character used as the
separator between values as an auto-removable suffix (similar to a
`<B>/</B>' after a directory).  However, this is not possible for a
`<B>-&gt;</B><I>string</I>' action as the matches for the argument are
generated by the calling function.  To get the usual behaviour, the
the calling function can add the separator <I>x</I> as a suffix by
passing the options `<B>-qS</B> <I>x</I>' either directly or indirectly to
<B>compadd</B>.
<P>

The option <B>-C</B> is treated in the same way as it is by <B>_arguments</B>.
In that case the parameter <B>curcontext</B> should be made local instead 
of <B>context</B> (as described above).
</DL>

<DT><B>_wanted</B> [ <B>-x</B> ] [ <B>-C</B> <I>name</I> ]  [ <B>-12VJ</B> ] <I>tag</I> <I>name</I> <I>descr</I> <I>command</I> <I>args</I> ...<DD>
In many contexts, completion can only generate one particular set of
matches, usually corresponding to a single tag.  However, it is
still necessary to decide whether the user requires matches of this type.
This function is useful in such a case.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The arguments to <B>_wanted</B> are the same as those to <B>_requested</B>,
i.e. arguments to be passed to <B>_description</B>.  However, in this case
the <I>command</I> is not optional;  all the processing of tags, including
the loop over both tags and tag labels and the generation of matches,
is carried out automatically by <B>_wanted</B>.
<P>

Hence to offer only one tag and immediately add the corresponding
matches with the given description:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>_wanted tag expl 'description' \ 
    compadd matches...</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Note that, as for <B>_requested</B>, the <I>command</I> must be able to
accept options to be passed down to <B>compadd</B>.
<P>

Like <B>_tags</B> this function supports the <B>-C</B> option to give a
different name for the argument context field.  The <B>-x</B> option has
the same meaning as for <B>_description</B>.

zshcompctl - zsh programmable completion

<A NAME="lbEU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This version of zsh has two ways of performing completion of words on the
command line.  New users of the shell may prefer to use the newer
and more powerful system based on shell functions; this is described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompsys.1.php">zshcompsys</A></I>(1), and the basic shell mechanisms which support it are
described in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompwid.1.php">zshcompwid</A></I>(1).  This manual entry describes the older
<B>compctl</B> command.

</DL>
<P>

Control the editor's completion behavior according to the supplied set
of <I>options</I>.  Various editing commands, notably
<B>expand-or-complete-word</B>, usually bound to tab, will
attempt to complete a word typed by the user, while others, notably
<B>delete-char-or-list</B>, usually bound to ^D in EMACS editing
mode, list the possibilities; <B>compctl</B> controls what those
possibilities are.  They may for example be filenames (the most common
case, and hence the default), shell variables, or words from a
user-specified list.
<P>

<A NAME="lbEV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND FLAGS</H2>

Completion of the arguments of a command may be different for each
command or may use the default.  The behavior when completing the
command word itself may also be separately specified.  These
correspond to the following flags and arguments, all of which (except
for <B>-L</B>) may be combined with any combination of the
<I>options</I> described subsequently in the section `Option Flags':
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>command</I> ...
controls completion for the named commands, which must be listed last
on the command line.  If completion is attempted for a command with a
pathname containing slashes and no completion definition is found, the
search is retried with the last pathname component. If the command starts
with a <B>=</B>, completion is tried with the pathname of the command.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Any of the <I>command</I> strings may be patterns of the form normally
used for filename generation.  These should be be quoted to protect them
from immediate expansion; for example the command string <B>'foo*'</B>
arranges for completion of the words of any command beginning with
<B>foo</B>.  When completion is attempted, all pattern completions are
tried in the reverse order of their definition until one matches.  By
default, completion then proceeds as normal, i.e. the shell will try to
generate more matches for the specific command on the command line; this
can be overridden by including <B>-tn</B> in the flags for the pattern
completion.
<P>

Note that aliases
are expanded before the command name is determined unless the
<B>COMPLETE_ALIASES</B> option is set.  Commands may not be combined
with the <B>-C</B>, <B>-D</B> or <B>-T</B> flags.
</DL>

<DT><B>-C</B><DD>
controls completion when the command word itself is being completed.
If no <B>compctl -C</B> command has been issued,  the names of any
executable command (whether in the path or specific to the shell, such
as aliases or functions) are completed.
<DT><B>-D</B><DD>
controls default completion behavior for the arguments of commands not
assigned any special behavior.  If no <B>compctl -D</B> command has
been issued, filenames are completed.
<DT><B>-T</B><DD>
supplies completion flags to be used before any other processing is
done, even before processing for <B>compctl</B>s defined for specific
commands.  This is especially useful when combined with extended
completion (the <B>-x</B> flag, see the section `Extended Completion' below).
Using this flag you can define default behavior
which will apply to all commands without exception, or you can alter
the standard behavior for all commands.  For example, if your access
to the user database is too slow and/or it contains too many users (so
that completion after `<B>~</B>' is too slow to be usable), you can use
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compctl -T -x 's[~] C[0,[^/]#]' -k friends -S/ -tn</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

to complete the strings in the array <B>friends</B> after a `<B>~</B>'.
The <B>C[...]</B> argument is necessary so that this form of ~-completion is
not tried after the directory name is finished.
</DL>

<DT><B>-L</B><DD>
lists the existing completion behavior in a manner suitable for
putting into a start-up script; the existing behavior is not changed.
Any combination of the above forms, or the <B>-M</B> flag (which must
follow the <B>-L</B> flag), may be specified, otherwise all defined
completions are listed.  Any other flags supplied are ignored.
<DT><I>no argument</I><DD>
If no argument is given, <B>compctl</B> lists all defined completions
in an abbreviated form;  with a list of <I>options</I>, all completions
with those flags set (not counting extended completion) are listed.
</DL>
<P>

If the <B>+</B> flag is alone and followed immediately by the <I>command</I>
list, the completion behavior for all the commands in the list is reset to
the default.  In other words, completion will subsequently use the
options specified by the <B>-D</B> flag.
<P>

The form with <B>-M</B> as the first and only option defines global
matching specifications (see
zshcompwid). The match specifications given will be used for every completion
attempt (only when using <B>compctl</B>, not with the new completion
system) and are tried in the order in which they are defined until one 
generates at least one match. E.g.:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compctl -M '' 'm:{a-zA-Z}={A-Za-z}'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This will first try completion without any global match specifications 
(the empty string) and, if that generates no matches, will try case
insensitive completion.

<H3>Flags with Arguments</H3>

These have user supplied arguments to determine how the list of
completions is to be made up:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-k</B> <I>array</I>
Names taken from the elements of <B>$</B><I>array</I> (note that the `<B>$</B>'
does not appear on the command line).
Alternatively, the argument <I>array</I> itself may be a set
of space- or comma-separated values in parentheses, in which any
delimiter may be escaped with a backslash; in this case the argument
should be quoted.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compctl -k &quot;(cputime filesize datasize stacksize
               coredumpsize resident descriptors)&quot; limit</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>-g</B> <I>globstring</I><DD>
The <I>globstring</I> is expanded using filename globbing; it should be
quoted to protect it from immediate expansion. The resulting
filenames are taken as the possible completions.  Use `<B>*(/)</B>' instead of
`<B>*/</B>' for directories.  The <B>fignore</B> special parameter is not
applied to the resulting files.  More than one pattern may be given
separated by blanks. (Note that brace expansion is <I>not</I> part of
globbing.  Use the syntax `<B>(either|or)</B>' to match alternatives.)
<DT><B>-s</B> <I>subststring</I><DD>
The <I>subststring</I> is split into words and these words are than
expanded using all shell expansion mechanisms (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1)).  The resulting words are taken as possible
completions.  The <B>fignore</B> special parameter is not applied to the
resulting files.  Note that <B>-g</B> is faster for filenames.
<DT><B>-K</B> <I>function</I><DD>
Call the given function to get the completions.  Unless the name
starts with an underscore, the function is
passed two arguments: the prefix and the suffix of the word on which
completion is to be attempted, in other words those characters before
the cursor position, and those from the cursor position onwards.  The
whole command line can be accessed with the <B>-c</B> and <B>-l</B> flags
of the <B>read</B> builtin. The
function should set the variable <B>reply</B> to an array containing
the completions (one completion per element); note that <B>reply</B>
should not be made local to the function.  From such a function the
command line can be accessed with the <B>-c</B> and <B>-l</B> flags to
the <B>read</B> builtin.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>function whoson { reply=(`users`); }
compctl -K whoson talk</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

completes only logged-on users after `<B>talk</B>'.  Note that `<B>whoson</B>' must
return an array, so `<B>reply=`users`</B>' would be incorrect.
</DL>

<DT><B>-H</B> <I>num pattern</I><DD>
The possible completions are taken from the last <I>num</I> history
lines.  Only words matching <I>pattern</I> are taken.  If <I>num</I> is
zero or negative the whole history is searched and if <I>pattern</I> is
the empty string all words are taken (as with `<B>*</B>').  A typical
use is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compctl -D -f + -H 0 ''</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

which forces completion to look back in the history list for a word if
no filename matches.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbEZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Control Flags</H3>

These do not directly specify types of name to be completed, but
manipulate the options that do:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-Q</B>
This instructs the shell not to quote any metacharacters in the possible
completions.  Normally the results of a completion are inserted into
the command line with any metacharacters quoted so that they are
interpreted as normal characters.  This is appropriate for filenames
and ordinary strings.  However, for special effects, such as inserting
a backquoted expression from a completion array (<B>-k</B>) so that
the expression will not be evaluated until the complete line is
executed, this option must be used.
<DT><B>-P</B> <I>prefix</I><DD>
The <I>prefix</I> is inserted just before the completed string; any
initial part already typed will be completed and the whole <I>prefix</I>
ignored for completion purposes.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compctl -j -P &quot;%&quot; kill</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

inserts a `%' after the kill command and then completes job names.
</DL>

<DT><B>-S</B> <I>suffix</I><DD>
When a completion is found the <I>suffix</I> is inserted after
the completed string.  In the case of menu completion the suffix is
inserted immediately, but it is still possible to cycle through the
list of completions by repeatedly hitting the same key.
<DT><B>-W</B> <I>file-prefix</I><DD>
With directory <I>file-prefix</I>:  for command, file, directory and
globbing completion (options <B>-c</B>, <B>-f</B>, <B>-/</B>, <B>-g</B>), the file
prefix is implicitly added in front of the completion.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compctl -/ -W ~/Mail maildirs</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

completes any subdirectories to any depth beneath the directory
<B>~/Mail</B>, although that prefix does not appear on the command line.
The <I>file-prefix</I> may also be of the form accepted by the <B>-k</B>
flag, i.e. the name of an array or a literal list in parenthesis. In
this case all the directories in the list will be searched for
possible completions.
</DL>

<DT><B>-q</B><DD>
If used with a suffix as specified by the <B>-S</B> option, this
causes the suffix to be removed if the next character typed is a blank
or does not insert anything or if the suffix consists of only one character
and the next character typed is the same character; this the same rule used
for the <B>AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH</B> option.  The option is most useful for list
separators (comma, colon, etc.).
<DT><B>-l</B> <I>cmd</I><DD>
This option restricts the range
of command line words that are considered to be arguments.  If
combined with one of the extended completion patterns `<B>p[</B>...<B>]</B>',
`<B>r[</B>...<B>]</B>', or `<B>R[</B>...<B>]</B>'  (see the section `Extended Completion'
below) the range is restricted to the range of arguments
specified in the brackets.  Completion is then performed as if these
had been given as arguments to the <I>cmd</I> supplied with the
option. If the <I>cmd</I> string is empty the first word in the range
is instead taken as the command name, and command name completion
performed on the first word in the range.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>compctl -x 'r[-exec,;]' -l '' -- find</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

completes arguments between `<B>-exec</B>' and the following `<B>;</B>' (or the end
of the command line if there is no such string) as if they were
a separate command line.
</DL>

<DT><B>-h</B> <I>cmd</I><DD>
Normally zsh completes quoted strings as a whole. With this option,
completion can be done separately on different parts of such
strings. It works like the <B>-l</B> option but makes the completion code 
work on the parts of the current word that are separated by
spaces. These parts are completed as if they were arguments to the
given <I>cmd</I>. If <I>cmd</I> is the empty string, the first part is
completed as a command name, as with <B>-l</B>.
<DT><B>-U</B><DD>
Use the whole list of possible completions, whether or not they
actually match the word on the command line.  The word typed so far
will be deleted.  This is most useful with a function (given by the
<B>-K</B> option) which can examine the word components passed to it
(or via the <B>read</B> builtin's <B>-c</B> and <B>-l</B> flags) and
use its own criteria to decide what matches.  If there is no
completion, the original word is retained.  Since the produced 
possible completions seldom have interesting common prefixes
and suffixes, menu completion is started immediately if <B>AUTO_MENU</B> is
set and this flag is used.
<DT><B>-y</B> <I>func-or-var</I><DD>
The list provided by <I>func-or-var</I> is displayed instead of the list
of completions whenever a listing is required; the actual completions
to be inserted are not affected.  It can be provided in two
ways. Firstly, if <I>func-or-var</I> begins with a <B>$</B> it defines a
variable, or if it begins with a left parenthesis a literal
array, which contains the list.  A variable may have been set by a
call to a function using the <B>-K</B> option.  Otherwise it contains the
name of a function which will be executed to create the list.  The
function will be passed as an argument list all matching completions,
including prefixes and suffixes expanded in full, and should set the
array <B>reply</B> to the result.  In both cases, the display list will
only be retrieved after a complete list of matches has been created.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that the returned list does not have to correspond, even in
length, to the original set of matches, and may be passed as a scalar
instead of an array.  No special formatting of characters is
performed on the output in this case; in particular, newlines are
printed literally and if they appear output in columns is suppressed.
</DL>

<DT><B>-X</B> <I>explanation</I><DD>
Print <I>explanation</I> when trying completion on the current set of
options. A `<B>%n</B>' in this string is replaced by the number of
matches that were added for this explanation string.
The explanation only appears if completion was tried and there was
no unique match, or when listing completions. Explanation strings 
will be listed together with the matches of the group specified
together with the <B>-X</B> option (using the <B>-J</B> or <B>-V</B>
option). If the same explanation string is given to multiple <B>-X</B>
options, the string appears only once (for each group) and the number
of matches shown for the `<B>%n</B>' is the total number of all matches
for each of these uses. In any case, the explanation string will only
be shown if there was at least one match added for the explanation
string.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The sequences <B>%B</B>, <B>%b</B>, <B>%S</B>, <B>%s</B>, <B>%U</B>, and <B>%u</B> specify
output attributes (bold, standout, and underline) and <B>%{...%}</B> can
be used to include literal escape sequences as in prompts.
</DL>

<DT><B>-Y</B> <I>explanation</I><DD>
Identical to <B>-X</B>, except that the <I>explanation</I> first undergoes
expansion following the usual rules for strings in double quotes.
The expansion will be carried out after any functions are called for
the <B>-K</B> or <B>-y</B> options, allowing them to set variables.
<DT><B>-t</B> <I>continue</I><DD>
The <I>continue</I>-string contains a character that specifies which set
of completion flags should be used next.  It is useful:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

(i) With <B>-T</B>, or when trying a list of pattern completions, when
<B>compctl</B> would usually continue with ordinary processing after
finding matches; this can be suppressed with `<B>-tn</B>'.
<P>

(ii) With a list of alternatives separated by <B>+</B>, when <B>compctl</B>
would normally stop when one of the alternatives generates matches.  It
can be forced to consider the next set of completions by adding `<B>-t+</B>'
to the flags of the alternative before the `<B>+</B>'.
<P>

(iii) In an extended completion list (see below), when <B>compctl</B> would
normally continue until a set of conditions succeeded, then use only
the immediately following flags.  With `<B>-t-</B>', <B>compctl</B> will
continue trying extended completions after the next `<B>-</B>'; with
`<B>-tx</B>' it will attempt completion with the default flags, in other
words those before the `<B>-x</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>-J</B> <I>name</I><DD>
This gives the name of the group the matches should be placed in. Groups
are listed and sorted separately; likewise, menu completion will offer
the matches in the groups in the order in which the groups were
defined. If no group name is explicitly given, the matches are stored in
a group named <I>default</I>. The first time a group name is encountered,
a group with that name is created. After that all matches with the same
group name are stored in that group.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This can be useful with non-exclusive alternative completions.  For
example, in

<P>

both files and variables are possible completions, as the <B>-t+</B> forces
both sets of alternatives before and after the <B>+</B> to be considered at
once.  Because of the <B>-J</B> options, however, all files are listed
before all variables.
</DL>

<DT><B>-V</B> <I>name</I><DD>
Like <B>-J</B>, but matches within the group will not be sorted in listings
nor in menu completion. These unsorted groups are in a different name
space from the sorted ones, so groups defined as <B>-J files</B> and <B>-V
files</B> are distinct.
<DT><B>-1</B><DD>
If given together with the <B>-V</B> option, makes
only consecutive duplicates in the group be removed. Note that groups
with and without this flag are in different name spaces.
<DT><B>-2</B><DD>
If given together with the <B>-J</B> or <B>-V</B> option, makes all
duplicates be kept. Again, groups with and without this flag are in
different name spaces.
<DT><B>-M</B> <I>match-spec</I><DD>
This defines additional matching control specifications that should be used
only when testing words for the list of flags this flag appears in. The format
of the <I>match-spec</I> string is described in

<P>

The form with `<B>+</B>' specifies alternative options. Completion is
tried with the options before the first `<B>+</B>'. If this produces no
matches completion is tried with the flags after the `<B>+</B>' and so on. If
there are no flags after the last `<B>+</B>' and a match has not been found
up to that point, default completion is tried.
If the list of flags contains a <B>-t</B> with a <B>+</B> character, the next
list of flags is used even if the current list produced matches.

</PRE>


</DL>
<P>

The form with `<B>-x</B>' specifies extended completion for the
commands given; as shown, it may be combined with alternative
completion using `<B>+</B>'.  Each <I>pattern</I> is examined in turn; when a
match is found, the corresponding <I>options</I>, as described in
the section `Option Flags' above, are used to generate possible
completions.  If no <I>pattern</I> matches, the <I>options</I> given
before the <B>-x</B> are used.
<P>

Note that each pattern should be supplied as a single argument and
should be quoted to prevent expansion of metacharacters by the
shell.
<P>

A <I>pattern</I> is built of sub-patterns separated by commas; it
matches if at least one of these sub-patterns matches (they are
`or'ed). These sub-patterns are in turn composed of other
sub-patterns separated by white spaces which match if all of the
sub-patterns match (they are `and'ed).  An element of the
sub-patterns is of the form `<I>c</I><B>[</B>...<B>][</B>...<B>]</B>', where the pairs of
brackets may be repeated as often as necessary, and matches if any of
the sets of brackets match (an `or').  The example below makes this
clearer.
<P>

The elements may be any of the following:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>s[</B><I>string</I><B>]</B>...
Matches if the current word on the command line starts with
one of the strings given in brackets.  The <I>string</I> is not removed
and is not part of the completion.
<DT><B>S[</B><I>string</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Like <B>s[</B><I>string</I><B>]</B> except that the <I>string</I> is part of the
completion.
<DT><B>p[</B><I>from</I><B>,</B><I>to</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Matches if the number of the current word is between one of
the <I>from</I> and <I>to</I> pairs inclusive. The comma and <I>to</I>
are optional; <I>to</I> defaults to the same value as <I>from</I>.  The
numbers may be negative: <B>-</B><I>n</I> refers to the <I>n</I>'th last word
on the line.
<DT><B>c[</B><I>offset</I><B>,</B><I>string</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Matches if the <I>string</I> matches the word offset by
<I>offset</I> from the current word position.  Usually <I>offset</I>
will be negative.
<DT><B>C[</B><I>offset</I><B>,</B><I>pattern</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Like <B>c</B> but using pattern matching instead.
<DT><B>w[</B><I>index</I><B>,</B><I>string</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Matches if the word in position <I>index</I> is equal
to the corresponding <I>string</I>.  Note that the word count is made
after any alias expansion.
<DT><B>W[</B><I>index</I><B>,</B><I>pattern</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Like <B>w</B> but using pattern matching instead.
<DT><B>n[</B><I>index</I><B>,</B><I>string</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Matches if the current word contains <I>string</I>.  Anything up to and
including the <I>index</I>th occurrence of this string will not be
considered part of the completion, but the rest will.  <I>index</I> may
be negative to count from the end: in most cases, <I>index</I> will be
1 or -1.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

name, names from the array <I>hosts</I> (assumed to contain hostnames,
though you must make the array yourself) will be completed.  Other
commands such as <B>rcp</B> can be handled similarly.
</DL>

<DT><B>N[</B><I>index</I><B>,</B><I>string</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Like <B>n</B> except that the string will be
taken as a character class.  Anything up to and including the
<I>index</I>th occurrence of any of the characters in <I>string</I>
will not be considered part of the completion.
<DT><B>m[</B><I>min</I><B>,</B><I>max</I><B>]</B>...<DD>

<I>max</I> inclusive.
<DT><B>r[</B><I>str1</I><B>,</B><I>str2</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Matches if the cursor is after a word with prefix <I>str1</I>.  If there
is also a word with prefix <I>str2</I> on the command line after the one 
matched by <I>str1</I> it matches
only if the cursor is before this word. If the comma and <I>str2</I> are
omitted, it matches if the cursor is after a word with prefix <I>str1</I>.
<DT><B>R[</B><I>str1</I><B>,</B><I>str2</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Like <B>r</B> but using pattern matching instead.
<DT><B>q[</B><I>str</I><B>]</B>...<DD>
Matches the word currently being completed is in single quotes and the

<H2>THE ZSH/CAP MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/cap</B> module is used for manipulating POSIX.1e (POSIX.6) capability
sets.  If the operating system does not support this interface, the
builtins defined by this module will do nothing.
The builtins in this module are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>cap</B> [ <I>capabilities</I> ]

<I>capabilities</I>.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbFG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/CLONE MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/clone</B> module makes available one builtin command:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>clone</B> <I>tty</I>
Creates a forked instance of the current shell, attached to the specified
<I>tty</I>.  In the new shell, the <B>PID</B>, <B>PPID</B> and <B>TTY</B> special
parameters are changed appropriately.  <B>$!</B> is set to zero in the new
shell, and to the new shell's PID in the original shell.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The return value of the builtin is zero in both shells if successful,
and non-zero on error.
</DL>


</DL>
<A NAME="lbFH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/COMPCTL MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/compctl</B> module makes available two builtin commands. <B>compctl</B>,
is the old, deprecated way to control completions for ZLE.  See
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompctl.1.php">zshcompctl</A></I>(1).
The other builtin command, <B>compcall</B> can be used in user-defined
completion widgets, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompwid.1.php">zshcompwid</A></I>(1).
<A NAME="lbFI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/COMPLETE MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/complete</B> module makes available several builtin commands which
can be used in user-defined completion widgets, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompwid.1.php">zshcompwid</A></I>(1).
<A NAME="lbFJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/COMPLIST MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/complist</B> module offers three extensions to completion listings:
the ability to highlight matches in such a list, the ability to
scroll through long lists and a different style of menu completion.
<P>

<A NAME="lbFK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Colored completion listings</H3>

Whenever one of the parameters <B>ZLS_COLORS</B> or <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> is set 
and the <B>zsh/complist</B> module is loaded or linked into the shell,
completion lists will be colored.  Note, however, that <B>complist</B> will
not automatically be loaded if it is not linked in:  on systems with
dynamic loading, `<B>zmodload zsh/complist</B>' is required.
<P>

The parameters <B>ZLS_COLORS</B> and <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> describe how matches
are highlighted.  To turn on highlighting an empty value suffices, in
which case all the default values given below will be used.  The format of
the value of these parameters is the same as used by the GNU version of the
<B>ls</B> command: a colon-separated list of specifications of the form
`<I>name</I>=<I>value</I>'.  The <I>name</I> may be one of the following strings,
most of which specify file types for which the <I>value</I> will be used.
The strings and their default values are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>no 0</B>
for normal text (i.e. when displaying something other than a matched file)
<DT><B>fi 0</B><DD>
for regular files
<DT><B>di 32</B><DD>
for directories
<DT><B>ln 36</B><DD>
for symbolic links
<DT><B>pi 31</B><DD>
for named pipes (FIFOs)
<DT><B>so 33</B><DD>
for sockets
<DT><B>bd 44;37</B><DD>
for block devices
<DT><B>cd 44;37</B><DD>
for character devices
<DT><B>ex 35</B><DD>
for executable files
<DT><B>mi</B> <I>none</I><DD>
for a non-existent file (default is the value defined for <B>fi</B>)
<DT><B>lc \e[</B><DD>
for the left code (see below)
<DT><B>rc m</B><DD>
for the right code
<DT><B>tc 0</B><DD>
for the character indicating the file type  printed after filenames if
the <B>LIST_TYPES</B> option is set
<DT><B>sp 0</B><DD>
for the spaces printed after matches to align the next column
<DT><B>ec</B> <I>none</I><DD>
for the end code
</DL>
<P>

Apart from these strings, the <I>name</I> may also be an asterisk
(`<B>*</B>') followed by any string. The <I>value</I> given for such a
string will be used for all files whose name ends with the string.
The <I>name</I> may also be an equals sign (`<B>=</B>') followed by a
pattern.  The <I>value</I> given for this pattern will be used for all
matches (not just filenames) whose display string are matched by
the pattern.  Definitions for both of these take precedence over the
values defined for file types and the form with the leading asterisk 
takes precedence over the form with the leading equal sign.
<P>

The last form also allows different parts of the displayed
strings to be colored differently.  For this, the pattern has to use the
`<B>(#b)</B>' globbing flag and pairs of parentheses surrounding the
parts of the strings that are to be colored differently.  In this case 
the <I>value</I> may consist of more than one color code separated by
equal signs.  The first code will be used for all parts for which no
explicit code is specified and the following codes will be used for
the parts matched by the sub-patterns in parentheses.  For example,
the specification `<B>=(#b)(?)*(?)=0=3=7</B>' will be used for all
matches which are at least two characters long and will use
the code `<B>3</B>' for the first character, `<B>7</B>' for the last
character and `<B>0</B>' for the rest.
<P>

All three forms of <I>name</I> may be preceded by a pattern in
parentheses.  If this is given, the <I>value</I> will be used
only for matches in groups whose names are matched by the pattern
given in the parentheses.  For example, `<B>(g*)m*=43</B>' highlights all
matches beginning with `<B>m</B>' in groups whose names  begin with
`<B>g</B>' using the color code `<B>43</B>'.  In case of the `<B>lc</B>',
`<B>rc</B>', and `<B>ec</B>' codes, the group pattern is ignored.
<P>

Note also that all patterns are tried in the order in which they
appear in the parameter value until the first one matches which is
then used.
<P>

When printing a match, the code prints the value of <B>lc</B>, the value
for the file-type or the last matching specification with a `<B>*</B>',
the value of <B>rc</B>, the string to display for the match itself, and
then the value of <B>ec</B> if that is defined or the values of <B>lc</B>,
<B>no</B>, and <B>rc</B> if <B>ec</B> is not defined.
<P>

The default values are ISO 6429 (ANSI) compliant and can be used on
vt100 compatible terminals such as <B>xterm</B>s.  On monochrome terminals
the default values will have no visible effect.  The <B>colors</B>
function from the contribution can be used to get associative arrays
containing the codes for ANSI terminals (see
the section `Other Functions' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshcontrib.1.php">zshcontrib</A></I>(1)).  For example, after loading <B>colors</B>, one could use
`<B>$colors[red]</B>' to get the code for foreground color red and
`<B>$colors[bg-green]</B>' for the code for background color green.
<P>

If the completion system invoked by compinit is used, these
parameters should not be set directly because the system controls them 
itself.  Instead, the <B>list-colors</B> style should be used (see
the section `Completion System Configuration' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompsys.1.php">zshcompsys</A></I>(1)).
<P>

<A NAME="lbFL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Scrolling in completion listings</H3>

To enable scrolling through a completion list, the <B>LISTPROMPT</B>
parameter must be set.  Its value will be used as the prompt; if it
is the empty string, a default prompt will be used.  The value may
contain escapes of the form `<B>%x</B>'.  It supports the escapes
`<B>%B</B>', `<B>%b</B>', `<B>%S</B>', `<B>%s</B>', `<B>%U</B>', `<B>%u</B>' and
`<B>%{...%}</B>' used also in shell prompts as well as three pairs of
additional sequences: a `<B>%l</B>' or `<B>%L</B>' is replaced by the number
of the last line shown and the total number of lines in the form
`<I>number</I><B>/</B><I>total</I>'; a `<B>%m</B>' or `<B>%M</B>' is replaced with
the number of the last match shown and the total number of matches; and 
`<B>%p</B>' or `<B>%P</B>' is replaced with `<B>Top</B>', `<B>Bottom</B>' or the
position of the first line shown in percent of the total number of
lines, respectively.  In each of these cases the form with the uppercase
letter will be replaced with a string of fixed width, padded to the
right with spaces, while the lowercase form will not be padded.
<P>

If the parameter <B>LISTPROMPT</B> is set, the completion code will not ask if
the list should be shown.  Instead it immediately starts displaying the
list, stopping after the first screenful, showing the prompt at the bottom,
waiting for a keypress after temporarily switching to the <B>listscroll</B>
keymap.  Some of the zle functions have a special meaning while scrolling
lists:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>send-break</B>
stops listing discarding the key pressed
<DT>
<DD>
<B>accept-line</B>, <B>down-history</B>, <B>down-line-or-history</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>down-line-or-search</B>, <B>vi-down-line-or-history</B>
scrolls forward one line
<DT>
<DD>
<B>complete-word</B>, <B>menu-complete</B>, <B>expand-or-complete</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B>, <B>menu-complete-or-expand</B>
scrolls forward one screenful
</DL>
<P>

Every other character stops listing and immediately processes the key
as usual.  Any key that is not bound in the <B>listscroll</B> keymap or
that is bound to <B>undefined-key</B> is looked up in the keymap
currently selected.
<P>

As for the <B>ZLS_COLORS</B> and <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> parameters,
<B>LISTPROMPT</B> should not be set directly when using the shell
function based completion system.  Instead, the <B>list-prompt</B> style
should be used.
<P>

<A NAME="lbFM">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Menu selection</H3>

The <B>zsh/complist</B> module also offers an alternative style of selecting
matches from a list, called menu selection, which can be used if the
shell is set up to return to the last prompt after showing a
completion list (see the <B>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</B> option in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshoptions.1.php">zshoptions</A></I>(1)).  It can be invoked directly by
the widget <B>menu-select</B> defined by the module.  Alternatively,
the parameter <B>MENUSELECT</B> can be set to an integer, which gives the
minimum number of matches that must be present before menu selection is
automatically turned on.  This second method requires that menu completion
be started, either directly from a widget such as <B>menu-complete</B>, or due
to one of the options <B>MENU_COMPLETE</B> or <B>AUTO_MENU</B> being set.  If
<B>MENUSELECT</B> is set, but is 0, 1 or empty, menu selection will always be
started during an ambiguous menu completion.
<P>

When using the completion system based on shell functions, the
<B>MENUSELECT</B> parameter should not be used (like the <B>ZLS_COLORS</B>
and <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> parameters described above).  Instead, the <B>menu</B> 
style should be used with the <B>select=</B><I>...</I> keyword.
<P>

After menu selection is started, the matches will be listed. If there
are more matches than fit on the screen, only the first screenful is
shown.  The
matches to insert into the command line can be selected from this
list.  In the list one match is highlighted using the value for <B>ma</B>
from the <B>ZLS_COLORS</B> or <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> parameter.  The default
value for this is `<B>7</B>' which forces the selected match to be
highlighted using standout mode on a vt100-compatible terminal.  If
neither <B>ZLS_COLORS</B> nor <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> is set, the same terminal
control sequence as for the `<B>%S</B>' escape in prompts is used.
<P>

If there are more matches than fit on the screen and the parameter
<B>MENUPROMPT</B> is set, its value will be shown below the matches.  It
supports the same escape sequences as <B>LISTPROMPT</B>, but the number
of the match or line shown will be that of the one where the mark is
placed.  If its value is the empty string, a default prompt will be
used.
<P>

The <B>MENUSCROLL</B> parameter can be used to specify how the list is
scrolled.  If the parameter is unset, this is done line by line, if it
is set to `<B>0</B>' (zero), the list will scroll half the number of
lines of the screen.  If the value is positive, it gives the number of
lines to scroll and if it is negative, the list will be scrolled
the number of lines of the screen minus the (absolute) value.
<P>

As for the <B>ZLS_COLORS</B>, <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> and <B>LISTPROMPT</B>
parameters, neither <B>MENUPROMPT</B> nor <B>MENUSCROLL</B> should be
set directly when using the shell function based completion
system.  Instead, the <B>select-prompt</B> and <B>select-scroll</B> styles
should be used.
<P>

The completion code sometimes decides not to show all of the matches
in the list.  These hidden matches are either matches for which the
completion function which added them explicitly requested that they
not appear in the list (using the <B>-n</B> option of the <B>compadd</B>
builtin command) or they are matches which duplicate a string already
in the list (because they differ only in things like prefixes or
suffixes that are not displayed).  In the list used for menu selection,
however, even these matches are shown so that it is possible to select
them.  To highlight such matches the <B>hi</B> and <B>du</B> capabilities in
the <B>ZLS_COLORS</B> and <B>ZLS_COLOURS</B> parameters are supported for
hidden matches of the first and second kind, respectively.
<P>

Selecting matches is done by moving the mark around using the zle movement
functions.  When not all matches can be shown on the screen at the same 
time, the list will scroll up and down when crossing the top or
bottom line.  The following zle functions have special meaning during
menu selection:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>accept-line</B>
accepts the current match and leaves menu selection
<DT><B>send-break</B><DD>
leaves menu selection and restores the previous contents of the
command line
<DT><B>redisplay</B>, <B>clear-screen</B><DD>
execute their normal function without leaving menu selection
<DT><B>accept-and-hold</B>, <B>accept-and-menu-complete</B><DD>
accept the currently inserted match and continue selection allowing to 
select the next match to insert into the line
<DT><B>accept-and-infer-next-history</B><DD>
accepts the current match and then tries completion with
menu selection again;  in the case of files this allows one to select
a directory and immediately attempt to complete files in it;  if there 
are no matches, a message is shown and one can use <B>undo</B> to go back 
to completion on the previous level, every other key leaves menu
selection (including the other zle functions which are otherwise
special during menu selection)
<DT><B>undo</B><DD>
removes matches inserted during the menu selection by one of the three 
functions before
<DT>
<DD>
<B>down-history</B>, <B>down-line-or-history</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>vi-down-line-or-history</B>,  <B>down-line-or-search</B>
moves the mark one line down
<DT>
<DD>
<B>up-history</B>, <B>up-line-or-history</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>vi-up-line-or-history</B>, <B>up-line-or-search</B>
moves the mark one line up
<DT><B>forward-char</B>, <B>vi-forward-char</B><DD>
moves the mark one column right
<DT><B>backward-char</B>, <B>vi-backward-char</B><DD>
moves the mark one column left
<DT>
<DD>
<B>forward-word</B>, <B>vi-forward-word</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>vi-forward-word-end</B>, <B>emacs-forward-word</B>
moves the mark one screenful down
<DT><B>backward-word</B>, <B>vi-backward-word</B>, <B>emacs-backward-word</B><DD>
moves the mark one screenful up
<DT><B>vi-forward-blank-word</B>, <B>vi-forward-blank-word-end</B><DD>
moves the mark to the first line of the next group of matches
<DT><B>vi-backward-blank-word</B><DD>
moves the mark to the last line of the previous group of matches
<DT><B>beginning-of-history</B><DD>
moves the mark to the first line
<DT><B>end-of-history</B><DD>
moves the mark to the last line
<DT>
<DD>
<B>beginning-of-buffer-or-history</B>, <B>beginning-of-line</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>beginning-of-line-hist</B>, <B>vi-beginning-of-line</B>
moves the mark to the leftmost column
<DT>
<DD>
<B>end-of-buffer-or-history</B>, <B>end-of-line</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>end-of-line-hist</B>, <B>vi-end-of-line</B>
moves the mark to the rightmost column
<DT>
<DD>
<B>complete-word</B>, <B>menu-complete</B>, <B>expand-or-complete</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B>, <B>menu-expand-or-complete</B>
moves the mark to the next match
<DT><B>reverse-menu-complete</B><DD>
moves the mark to the previous match
<DT><B>vi-insert</B><DD>
this toggles between normal and interactive mode; in interactive mode
the keys bound to <B>self-insert</B> and <B>self-insert-unmeta</B> insert
into the command line as in normal editing mode but without leaving
menu selection; after each character completion is tried again and the
list changes to contain only the new matches; the completion widgets
make the longest unambiguous string be inserted in the command line
and <B>undo</B> and <B>backward-delete-char</B> go back to the previous set
of matches
<DT><B>history-incremental-search-forward</B>,<DD>
<B>history-incremental-search-backward</B>
this starts incremental searches in the list of completions displayed;
in this mode, <B>accept-line</B> only leaves incremental search, going
back to the normal menu selection mode
</DL>
<P>

All movement functions wrap around at the edges; any other zle function not
listed leaves menu selection and executes that function.  It is possible to
make widgets in the above list do the same by using the form of the widget
with a `<B>.</B>' in front.  For example, the widget `<B>.accept-line</B>' has
the effect of leaving menu selection and accepting the entire command line.
<P>

During this selection the widget uses the keymap <B>menuselect</B>.  Any
key that is not defined in this keymap or that is bound to
<B>undefined-key</B> is looked up in the keymap currently selected.  This
is used to ensure that the most important keys used during selection
(namely the cursor keys, return, and TAB) have sensible defaults.  However,
keys in the <B>menuselect</B> keymap can be modified directly using the
<B>bindkey</B> builtin command (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)). For example, to make the return key leave menu selection without
accepting the match currently selected one could call
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey -M menuselect '^M' send-break</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

after loading the <B>zsh/complist</B> module.
<A NAME="lbFN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/COMPUTIL MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/computil</B> module adds several builtin commands that are used by
some of the completion functions in the completion system based on shell
functions (see 
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompsys.1.php">zshcompsys</A></I>(1)
).  Except for <B>compquote</B> these builtin commands are very
specialised and thus not very interesting when writing your own
completion functions.  In summary, these builtin commands are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>comparguments</B>
This is used by the <B>_arguments</B> function to do the argument and
command line parsing.  Like <B>compdescribe</B> it has an option <B>-i</B> to 
do the parsing and initialize some internal state and various options
to access the state information to decide what should be completed.
<DT><B>compdescribe</B><DD>
This is used by the <B>_describe</B> function to build the displays for
the matches and to get the strings to add as matches with their
options.  On the first call one of the options <B>-i</B> or <B>-I</B> should be
supplied as the first argument.  In the first case, display strings without
the descriptions will be generated, in the second case, the string used to
separate the matches from their descriptions must be given as the
second argument and the descriptions (if any) will be shown.  All other 
arguments are like the definition arguments to <B>_describe</B> itself.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Once <B>compdescribe</B> has been called with either the <B>-i</B> or the
<B>-I</B> option, it can be repeatedly called with the <B>-g</B> option and
the names of five arrays as its arguments.  This will step through the
different sets of matches and store the options in the first array,
the strings with descriptions in the second, the matches for these in
the third, the strings without descriptions in the fourth, and the
matches for them in the fifth array.  These are then directly given to
<B>compadd</B> to register the matches with the completion code.
</DL>

<DT><B>compfiles</B><DD>
Used by the <B>_path_files</B> function to optimize complex recursive
filename generation (globbing).  It does three things.  With the
<B>-p</B> and <B>-P</B> options it builds the glob patterns to use,
including the paths already handled and trying to optimize the
patterns with respect to the prefix and suffix from the line and the
match specification currently used.  The <B>-i</B> option does the
directory tests for the <B>ignore-parents</B> style and the <B>-r</B> option 
tests if a component for some of the matches are equal to the string
on the line and removes all other matches if that is true.
<DT><B>compgroups</B><DD>
Used by the <B>_tags</B> function to implement the internals of the
<B>group-order</B> style.  This only takes its arguments as names of
completion groups and creates the groups for it (all six types: sorted 
and unsorted, both without removing duplicates, with removing all
duplicates and with removing consecutive duplicates).
<DT><B>compquote</B> [ <B>-p</B> ] <I>names</I> ...<DD>
There may be reasons to write completion functions that have to add
the matches using the <B>-Q</B> option to <B>compadd</B> and perform quoting
themselves.  Instead of interpreting the first character of the
<B>all_quotes</B> key of the <B>compstate</B> special association and using
the <B>q</B> flag for parameter expansions, one can use this builtin
command.  The arguments are the names of scalar or array parameters
and the values of these parameters are quoted as needed for the
innermost quoting level.  If the <B>-p</B> option is given, quoting is
done as if there is some prefix before the values of the parameters,
so that a leading equal sign will not be quoted.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The return value is non-zero in case of an error and zero otherwise.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>comptags</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>comptry</B>
These implement the internals of the tags mechanism.
<DT><B>compvalues</B><DD>
Like <B>comparguments</B>, but for the <B>_values</B> function.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbFO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/DATETIME MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/datetime</B> module makes available one builtin command:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>strftime</B> [ <B>-s</B> <I>scalar</I> ] <I>format</I> <I>epochtime</I> 
Output the date denoted by <I>epochtime</I> in the <I>format</I>
specified.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <B>-s</B> <I>scalar</I> is given, assign the date to <I>scalar</I> instead
of printing it.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

The <B>zsh/datetime</B> module makes available one parameter:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>EPOCHSECONDS</B>
An integer value representing the number of seconds since the
epoch.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbFP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/DELTOCHAR MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/deltochar</B> module makes available two ZLE functions:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>delete-to-char</B>
Read a character from the keyboard, and
delete from the cursor position up to and including the next
(or, with repeat count <I>n</I>, the <I>n</I>th) instance of that character.
Negative repeat counts mean delete backwards.
<DT><B>zap-to-char</B><DD>
This behaves like <B>delete-to-char</B>, except that the final occurrence of
the character itself is not deleted.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbFQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/EXAMPLE MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/example</B> module makes available one builtin command:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>example</B> [ <B>-flags</B> ] [ <I>args</I> ... ]
Displays the flags and arguments it is invoked with.
</DL>
<P>

The purpose of the module is to serve as an example of how to write a
module.
<A NAME="lbFR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/FILES MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/files</B> module makes some standard commands available as builtins:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>chgrp</B> [ <B>-Rs</B> ] <I>group</I> <I>filename</I> ...
Changes group of files specified.  This is equivalent to <B>chown</B> with
a <I>user-spec</I> argument of `<B>:</B><I>group</I>'.
<DT><B>chown</B> [ <B>-Rs</B> ] <I>user-spec</I> <I>filename</I> ...<DD>
Changes ownership and group of files specified.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>user-spec</I> can be in four forms:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>user</I><DD>
change owner to <I>user</I>; do not change group
<DT><I>user</I><B>::</B><DD>
change owner to <I>user</I>; do not change group
<DT><I>user</I><B>:</B><DD>
change owner to <I>user</I>; change group to <I>user</I>'s primary group
<DT><I>user</I><B>:</B><I>group</I><DD>
change owner to <I>user</I>; change group to <I>group</I>
<DT><B>:</B><I>group</I><DD>
do not change owner; change group to <I>group</I>

</DL>
<P>

In each case, the `<B>:</B>' may instead be a `<B>.</B>'.  The rule is that
if there is a `<B>:</B>' then the separator is `<B>:</B>', otherwise
if there is a `<B>.</B>' then the separator is `<B>.</B>', otherwise
there is no separator.
<P>

Each of <I>user</I> and <I>group</I> may be either a username (or group name, as
appropriate) or a decimal user ID (group ID).  Interpretation as a name
takes precedence, if there is an all-numeric username (or group name).
<P>

The <B>-R</B> option causes <B>chown</B> to recursively descend into directories,
changing the ownership of all files in the directory after
changing the ownership of the directory itself.
<P>

The <B>-s</B> option is a zsh extension to <B>chown</B> functionality.  It enables
paranoid behaviour, intended to avoid security problems involving
a <B>chown</B> being tricked into affecting files other than the ones
intended.  It will refuse to follow symbolic links, so that (for example)
``<B>chown luser /tmp/foo/passwd</B>'' can't accidentally chown <B>/etc/passwd</B>
if <B>/tmp/foo</B> happens to be a link to <B>/etc</B>.  It will also check
where it is after leaving directories, so that a recursive chown of
a deep directory tree can't end up recursively chowning <B>/usr</B> as
a result of directories being moved up the tree.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>ln</B> [ <B>-dfis</B> ] <I>filename</I> <I>dest</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>ln</B> [ <B>-dfis</B> ] <I>filename</I> ... <I>dir</I>
Creates hard (or, with <B>-s</B>, symbolic) links.  In the first form, the
specified <I>dest</I>ination is created, as a link to the specified
<I>filename</I>.  In the second form, each of the <I>filename</I>s is
taken in turn, and linked to a pathname in the specified <I>dir</I>ectory
that has the same last pathname component.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Normally, <B>ln</B> will not attempt to create hard links to
directories.  This check can be overridden using the <B>-d</B> option.
Typically only the super-user can actually succeed in creating
hard links to directories.
This does not apply to symbolic links in any case.
<P>

By default, existing files cannot be replaced by links.
The <B>-i</B> option causes the user to be queried about replacing
existing files.  The <B>-f</B> option causes existing files to be
silently deleted, without querying.  <B>-f</B> takes precedence.
</DL>

<DT><B>mkdir</B> [ <B>-p</B> ] [ <B>-m</B> <I>mode</I> ] <I>dir</I> ...<DD>
Creates directories.  With the <B>-p</B> option, non-existing parent
directories are first created if necessary, and there will be
no complaint if the directory already exists.
The <B>-m</B> option can be used to specify (in octal) a set of file permissions
for the created directories, otherwise mode 777 modified by the current
<B>umask</B> (see <I><A HREF="../man2/umask.2.php">umask</A></I>(2)) is used.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>mv</B> [ <B>-fi</B> ] <I>filename</I> <I>dest</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>mv</B> [ <B>-fi</B> ] <I>filename</I> ... <I>dir</I>
Moves files.  In the first form, the specified <I>filename</I> is moved
to the specified <I>dest</I>ination.  In the second form, each of the
<I>filename</I>s is
taken in turn, and moved to a pathname in the specified <I>dir</I>ectory
that has the same last pathname component.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

By default, the user will be queried before replacing any file
that the user cannot write to, but writable files will be silently
removed.
The <B>-i</B> option causes the user to be queried about replacing
any existing files.  The <B>-f</B> option causes any existing files to be
silently deleted, without querying.  <B>-f</B> takes precedence.
<P>

Note that this <B>mv</B> will not move files across devices.
Historical versions of <B>mv</B>, when actual renaming is impossible,
fall back on copying and removing files; if this behaviour is desired,
use <B>cp</B> and <B>rm</B> manually.  This may change in a future version.
</DL>

<DT><B>rm</B> [ <B>-dfirs</B> ] <I>filename</I> ...<DD>
Removes files and directories specified.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Normally, <B>rm</B> will not remove directories (except with the <B>-r</B>
option).  The <B>-d</B> option causes <B>rm</B> to try removing directories
with <B>unlink</B> (see <I><A HREF="../man2/unlink.2.php">unlink</A></I>(2)), the same method used for files.
Typically only the super-user can actually succeed in unlinking
directories in this way.
<B>-d</B> takes precedence over <B>-r</B>.
<P>

By default, the user will be queried before removing any file
that the user cannot write to, but writable files will be silently
removed.
The <B>-i</B> option causes the user to be queried about removing
any files.  The <B>-f</B> option causes files to be
silently deleted, without querying, and suppresses all error indications.
<B>-f</B> takes precedence.
<P>

The <B>-r</B> option causes <B>rm</B> to recursively descend into directories,
deleting all files in the directory before removing the directory with
the <B>rmdir</B> system call (see <I><A HREF="../man2/rmdir.2.php">rmdir</A></I>(2)).
<P>

The <B>-s</B> option is a zsh extension to <B>rm</B> functionality.  It enables
paranoid behaviour, intended to avoid common security problems involving
a root-run <B>rm</B> being tricked into removing files other than the ones
intended.  It will refuse to follow symbolic links, so that (for example)
``<B>rm /tmp/foo/passwd</B>'' can't accidentally remove <B>/etc/passwd</B>
if <B>/tmp/foo</B> happens to be a link to <B>/etc</B>.  It will also check
where it is after leaving directories, so that a recursive removal of
a deep directory tree can't end up recursively removing <B>/usr</B> as
a result of directories being moved up the tree.
</DL>

<DT><B>rmdir</B> <I>dir</I> ...<DD>
Removes empty directories specified.
<DT><B>sync</B><DD>
Calls the system call of the same name (see <I><A HREF="../man2/sync.2.php">sync</A></I>(2)), which
flushes dirty buffers to disk.  It might return before the I/O has
actually been completed.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbFS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/MAPFILE MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/mapfile</B> module provides one special associative array parameter of
the same name.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>mapfile</B>
This associative array takes as keys the names of files; the resulting
value is the content of the file.  The value is treated identically to any
other text coming from a parameter.  The value may also be assigned to, in
which case the file in question is written (whether or not it originally
existed); or an element may be unset, which will delete the file in
question.  For example, `<B>vared mapfile[myfile]</B>' works as expected,
editing the file `<B>myfile</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When the array is accessed as a whole, the keys are the names of files in
the current directory, and the values are empty (to save a huge overhead in
memory).  Thus <B>${(k)mapfile}</B> has the same affect as the glob operator
<B>*(D)</B>, since files beginning with a dot are not special.  Care must be
taken with expressions such as <B>rm ${(k)mapfile}</B>, which will delete
every file in the current directory without the usual `<B>rm *</B>' test.
<P>

The parameter <B>mapfile</B> may be made read-only; in that case, files
referenced may not be written or deleted.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbFT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Limitations</H3>

<P>

Although reading and writing of the file in question is efficiently
handled, zsh's internal memory management may be arbitrarily baroque.  Thus
it should not automatically be assumed that use of <B>mapfile</B> represents a
gain in efficiency over use of other mechanisms.  Note in particular that
the whole contents of the file will always reside physically in memory when
accessed (possibly multiple times, due to standard parameter substitution
operations).  In particular, this means handling of sufficiently long files
(greater than the machine's swap space, or than the range of the pointer
type) will be incorrect.
<P>

No errors are printed or flagged for non-existent, unreadable, or
unwritable files, as the parameter mechanism is too low in the shell
execution hierarchy to make this convenient.
<P>

It is unfortunate that the mechanism for loading modules does not yet allow
the user to specify the name of the shell parameter to be given the special
behaviour.
<A NAME="lbFU">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/MATHFUNC MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/mathfunc</B> module provides standard
mathematical functions for use when
evaluating mathematical formulae.  The syntax agrees with normal C and
FORTRAN conventions, for example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>(( f = sin(0.3) ))</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

assigns the sine of 0.3 to the parameter f.
<P>

Most functions take floating point arguments and return a floating point
value.  However, any necessary conversions from or to integer type will be
performed automatically by the shell.  Apart from <B>atan</B> with a second
argument and the <B>abs</B>, <B>int</B> and <B>float</B> functions, all functions
behave as noted in the manual page for the corresponding C function,
except that any arguments out of range for the function in question will be
detected by the shell and an error reported.
<P>

The following functions take a single floating point argument: <B>acos</B>,
<B>acosh</B>, <B>asin</B>, <B>asinh</B>, <B>atan</B>, <B>atanh</B>, <B>cbrt</B>, <B>ceil</B>,
<B>cos</B>, <B>cosh</B>, <B>erf</B>, <B>erfc</B>, <B>exp</B>, <B>expm1</B>, <B>fabs</B>,
<B>floor</B>, <B>gamma</B>, <B>j0</B>, <B>j1</B>, <B>lgamma</B>, <B>log</B>, <B>log10</B>,
<B>log1p</B>, <B>logb</B>, <B>sin</B>, <B>sinh</B>, <B>sqrt</B>, <B>tan</B>, <B>tanh</B>,
<B>y0</B>, <B>y1</B>.  The <B>atan</B> function can optionally take a second
argument, in which case it behaves like the C function <B>atan2</B>.
The <B>ilogb</B> function takes a single floating point argument, but
returns an integer.
<P>

The function <B>signgam</B> takes no arguments, and returns an integer, which
is the C variable of the same name, as described in <I><A HREF="../man3/gamma.3.php">gamma</A></I>(3).  Note
that it is therefore only useful immediately after a call to <B>gamma</B> or
<B>lgamma</B>.  Note also that `<B>signgam()</B>' and `<B>signgam</B>' are distinct
expressions.
<P>

The following functions take two floating point arguments: <B>copysign</B>,
<B>fmod</B>, <B>hypot</B>, <B>nextafter</B>.
<P>

The following take an integer first argument and a floating point second
argument: <B>jn</B>, <B>yn</B>.
<P>

The following take a floating point first argument and an integer second
argument: <B>ldexp</B>, <B>scalb</B>.
<P>

The function <B>abs</B> does not convert the type of its single argument; it
returns the absolute value of either a floating point number or an
integer.  The functions <B>float</B> and <B>int</B> convert their arguments into
a floating point or integer value (by truncation) respectively.
<P>

Note that the C <B>pow</B> function is available in ordinary math evaluation
as the `<B>**</B>' operator and is not provided here.
<P>

The function <B>rand48</B> is available if your system's mathematical library
has the function <B><A HREF="../man3/erand48.3.php">erand48</A>(3)</B>.  It returns a pseudo-random floating point
number between 0 and 1.  It takes a single string optional argument.
<P>

If the argument is not present, the random number seed is initialised by
three calls to the <B><A HREF="../man3/rand.3.php">rand</A>(3)</B> function --- this produces the same random
numbers as the next three values of <B>$RANDOM</B>.
<P>

If the argument is present, it gives the name of a scalar parameter where
the current random number seed will be stored.  On the first call, the
value must contain at least twelve hexadecimal digits (the remainder of the
string is ignored), or the seed will be initialised in the same manner as
for a call to <B>rand48</B> with no argument.  Subsequent calls to
<B>rand48</B>(<I>param</I>) will then maintain the seed in the
parameter <I>param</I> as a string of twelve hexadecimal digits, with no base
signifier.  The random number sequences for different parameters are
completely independent, and are also independent from that used by calls to
<B>rand48</B> with no argument.
<P>

For example, consider
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>print $(( rand48(seed) ))
print $(( rand48() ))
print $(( rand48(seed) ))</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Assuming <B>$seed</B> does not exist, it will be initialised by the first
call.  In the second call, the default seed is initialised; note, however,
that because of the properties of <B>rand()</B> there is a correlation between
the seeds used for the two initialisations, so for more secure uses, you
should generate your own 12-byte seed.  The third call returns to the same
sequence of random numbers used in the first call, unaffected by the
intervening <B>rand48()</B>.

<H2>THE ZSH/PARAMETER MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/parameter</B> module gives access to some of the internal hash
tables used by the shell by defining some special parameters.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>options</B>
The keys for this associative array are the names of the options that
can be set and unset using the <B>setopt</B> and <B>unsetopt</B>
builtins. The value of each key is either the string <B>on</B> if the
option is currently set, or the string <B>off</B> if the option is unset.
Setting a key to one of these strings is like setting or unsetting
the option, respectively. Unsetting a key in this array is like
setting it to the value <B>off</B>.
<DT><B>commands</B><DD>
This array gives access to the command hash table. The keys are the
names of external commands, the values are the pathnames of the files
that would be executed when the command would be invoked. Setting a
key in this array defines a new entry in this table in the same way as
with the <B>hash</B> builtin. Unsetting a key as in `<B>unset
&quot;commands[foo]&quot;</B>' removes the entry for the given key from the command 
hash table.
<DT><B>functions</B><DD>
This associative array maps names of enabled functions to their
definitions. Setting a key in it is like defining a function with the
name given by the key and the body given by the value. Unsetting a key
removes the definition for the function named by the key.
<DT><B>dis_functions</B><DD>
Like <B>functions</B> but for disabled functions.
<DT><B>builtins</B><DD>
This associative array gives information about the builtin commands
currently enabled. The keys are the names of the builtin commands and
the values are either `<B>undefined</B>' for builtin commands that will
automatically be loaded from a module if invoked or `<B>defined</B>' for
builtin commands that are already loaded.
<DT><B>dis_builtins</B><DD>
Like <B>builtins</B> but for disabled builtin commands.
<DT><B>reswords</B><DD>
This array contains the enabled reserved words.
<DT><B>dis_reswords</B><DD>
Like <B>reswords</B> but for disabled reserved words.
<DT><B>aliases</B><DD>
This maps the names of the regular aliases currently enabled to their
expansions.
<DT><B>dis_aliases</B><DD>
Like <B>aliases</B> but for disabled regular aliases.
<DT><B>galiases</B><DD>
Like <B>aliases</B>, but for global aliases.
<DT><B>dis_galiases</B><DD>
Like <B>galiases</B> but for disabled global aliases.
<DT><B>saliases</B><DD>
Like <B>raliases</B>, but for suffix aliases.
<DT><B>dis_saliases</B><DD>
Like <B>saliases</B> but for disabled suffix aliases.
<DT><B>parameters</B><DD>
The keys in this associative array are the names of the parameters
currently defined. The values are strings describing the type of the
parameter, in the same format used by the <B>t</B> parameter flag, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshexpn.1.php">zshexpn</A></I>(1)
.
Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not possible.
<DT><B>modules</B><DD>
An associative array giving information about modules. The keys are the names
of the modules loaded, registered to be autoloaded, or aliased. The
value says which state the named module is in and is one of the
strings `<B>loaded</B>', `<B>autoloaded</B>', or `<B>alias:</B><I>name</I>',
where <I>name</I> is the name the module is aliased to.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not possible.
</DL>

<DT><B>dirstack</B><DD>
A normal array holding the elements of the directory stack. Note that
the output of the <B>dirs</B> builtin command includes one more
directory, the current working directory.
<DT><B>history</B><DD>
This associative array maps history event numbers to the full history lines.
<DT><B>historywords</B><DD>
A special array containing the words stored in the history.
<DT><B>jobdirs</B><DD>
This associative array maps job numbers to the directories from which the
job was started (which may not be the current directory of the job).
<DT><B>jobtexts</B><DD>
This associative array maps job numbers to the texts of the command lines
that were used to start the jobs.
<DT><B>jobstates</B><DD>
This associative array gives information about the states of the jobs
currently known. The keys are the job numbers and the values are
strings of the form
`<I>job-state</I>:<I>mark</I>:<I>pid</I><B>=</B><I>state</I><B>...</B>'. The
<I>job-state</I> gives the state the whole job is currently in, one of
`<B>running</B>', `<B>suspended</B>', or `<B>done</B>'. The <I>mark</I> is
`<B>+</B>' for the current job, `<B>-</B>' for the previous job and empty
otherwise. This is followed by one `<I>pid</I><B>=</B><I>state</I>' for every
process in the job. The <I>pid</I>s are, of course, the process IDs and
the <I>state</I> describes the state of that process.
<DT><B>nameddirs</B><DD>
This associative array maps the names of named directories to the pathnames
they stand for.
<DT><B>userdirs</B><DD>
This associative array maps user names to the pathnames of their home
directories.
<DT><B>funcstack</B><DD>
This array contains the names of the functions currently being
executed. The first element is the name of the function using the
parameter.

<H2>THE ZSH/STAT MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/stat</B> module makes available one builtin command:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>stat</B> [ <B>-gnNolLtTrs</B> ] [ <B>-f</B> <I>fd</I> ] [ <B>-H</B> <I>hash</I> ] [ <B>-A</B> <I>array</I> ] [ <B>-F</B> <I>fmt</I> ] [ <B>+</B><I>element</I> ] [ <I>file</I> ... ]
The command acts as a front end to the <B>stat</B> system call (see
<I><A HREF="../man2/stat.2.php">stat</A></I>(2)).
If the <B>stat</B> call fails, the appropriate system error message
printed and status 1 is returned.
The fields of <B>struct stat</B> give information about
the files provided as arguments to the command.  In addition to those
available from the <B>stat</B> call, an extra element `<B>link</B>' is provided.
These elements are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>device</B>
The number of the device on which the file resides.
<DT><B>inode</B><DD>
The unique number of the file on this device (`<I>inode</I>' number).
<DT><B>mode</B><DD>
The mode of the file; that is, the file's type and access permissions.
With the <B>-s</B> option, this will
be returned as a string corresponding to the first column in the
display of the <B>ls -l</B> command.
<DT><B>nlink</B><DD>
The number of hard links to the file.
<DT><B>uid</B><DD>
The user ID of the owner of the file.  With the <B>-s</B>
option, this is displayed as a user name.
<DT><B>gid</B><DD>
The group ID of the file.  With the <B>-s</B> option, this
is displayed as a group name.
<DT><B>rdev</B><DD>
The raw device number.  This is only useful for special devices.
<DT><B>size</B><DD>
The size of the file in bytes.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>atime</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>mtime</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>ctime</B>
The last access, modification and inode change times
of the file, respectively, as the number of seconds since
midnight GMT on 1st January, 1970.  With the <B>-s</B> option,
these are printed as strings for the local time zone; the format
can be altered with the <B>-F</B> option, and with the <B>-g</B>
option the times are in GMT.
<DT><B>blksize</B><DD>
The number of bytes in one allocation block on the
device on which the file resides.
<DT><B>block</B><DD>
The number of disk blocks used by the file.
<DT><B>link</B><DD>
If the file is a link and the <B>-L</B> option is in
effect, this contains the name of the file linked to, otherwise
it is empty.  Note that if this element is selected (``<B>stat +link</B>'')
then the <B>-L</B> option is automatically used.
</DL>
<P>

A particular element may be selected by including its name
preceded by a `<B>+</B>' in the option list; only one element is allowed.
The element may be shortened to any unique set of leading
characters.  Otherwise, all elements will be shown for all files.
<P>

Options:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-A</B> <I>array</I>
Instead of displaying the results on standard
output, assign them to an <I>array</I>, one <B>struct stat</B> element per array
element for each file in order.  In this case neither the name
of the element nor the name of the files appears in <I>array</I> unless the
<B>-t</B> or <B>-n</B> options were given, respectively.  If <B>-t</B> is given,
the element name appears as a prefix to the
appropriate array element; if <B>-n</B> is given, the file name
appears as a separate array element preceding all the others.
Other formatting options are respected.
<DT><B>-H</B> <I>hash</I><DD>
Similar to <B>-A</B>, but instead assign the values to <I>hash</I>.  The keys
are the elements listed above.  If the <B>-n</B> option is provided then the
name of the file is included in the hash with key <B>name</B>.
<DT><B>-f</B> <I>fd</I><DD>
Use the file on file descriptor <I>fd</I> instead of
named files; no list of file names is allowed in this case.
<DT><B>-F</B> <I>fmt</I><DD>
Supplies a <B>strftime</B> (see <I><A HREF="../man3/strftime.3.php">strftime</A></I>(3)) string for the
formatting of the time elements.  The <B>-s</B> option is implied.
<DT><B>-g</B><DD>
Show the time elements in the GMT time zone.  The
<B>-s</B> option is implied.
<DT><B>-l</B><DD>
List the names of the type elements (to standard
output or an array as appropriate) and return immediately;
options other than <B>-A</B> and arguments are ignored.
<DT><B>-L</B><DD>
Perform an <B>lstat</B> (see <I><A HREF="../man2/lstat.2.php">lstat</A></I>(2)) rather than a <B>stat</B>
system call.  In this case, if the file is a link, information
about the link itself rather than the target file is returned.
This option is required to make the <B>link</B> element useful.
<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
Always show the names of files.  Usually these are
only shown when output is to standard output and there is more
than one file in the list.
<DT><B>-N</B><DD>
Never show the names of files.
<DT><B>-o</B><DD>
If a raw file mode is printed, show it in octal, which is more useful for
human consumption than the default of decimal.  A leading zero will be
printed in this case.  Note that this does not affect whether a raw or
formatted file mode is shown, which is controlled by the <B>-r</B> and <B>-s</B>
options, nor whether a mode is shown at all.
<DT><B>-r</B><DD>
Print raw data (the default format) alongside string
data (the <B>-s</B> format); the string data appears in parentheses
after the raw data.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
Print <B>mode</B>, <B>uid</B>, <B>gid</B> and the three time
elements as strings instead of numbers.  In each case the format
is like that of <B>ls -l</B>.
<DT><B>-t</B><DD>
Always show the type names for the elements of
<B>struct stat</B>.  Usually these are only shown when output is to
standard output and no individual element has been selected.
<DT><B>-T</B><DD>
Never show the type names of the <B>struct stat</B> elements.

<H2>THE ZSH/SYSTEM MODULE</H2>

<H2>BUILTINS</H2>

<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>syserror</B> <B>[ -e</B> <I>errvar</I> <B>] [ -p</B> <I>prefix</I> <B>] [</B> <I>errno</I> <B>|</B> <I>errname</I> <B>]</B>
This command prints out the error message associated with <I>errno</I>, a
system error number, followed by a newline to standard error.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Instead of the error number, a name <I>errname</I>, for example
<B>ENOENT</B>, may be used.  The set of names is the same as the contents
of the array <B>errnos</B>, see below.
<P>

If the string <I>prefix</I> is given, it is printed in front of the error
message, with no intervening space.
<P>

If <I>errvar</I> is supplied, the entire message, without a newline, is
assigned to the parameter names <I>errvar</I> and nothing is output.
<P>

A return value of 0 indicates the message was successfully printed
(although it may not be useful if the error number was out of the
system's range), a return value of 1 indicates an error in the
parameters, and a return value of 2 indicates the error name was
not recognised (no message is printed for this).
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>sysread [ -c</B> <I>countvar</I> <B>] [ -i</B> <I>infd</I> <B>] [ -o</B> <I>outfd</I> <B>]</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>[&nbsp;-s</B>&nbsp;<I>bufsize</I>&nbsp;<B>]&nbsp;[&nbsp;-t</B>&nbsp;<I>timeout</I>&nbsp;<B>]&nbsp;[</B>&nbsp;<I>param</I>&nbsp;<B>]</B>
Perform a single system read from file descriptor <I>infd</I>, or zero if
that is not given.  The result of the read is stored in <I>param</I> or
<I>REPLY</I> if that is not given.  If <I>countvar</I> is given, the number
of bytes read is assigned to the parameter named by <I>countvar</I>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The maximum number of bytes read is <I>bufsize</I> or 8192 if that is not
given, however the command returns as soon as any number of bytes was
successfully read.
<P>

If <I>timeout</I> is given, it specifies a timeout in seconds, which may
be zero to poll the file descriptor.  This is handled by the <B>poll</B>
system call if available, otherwise the <B>select</B> system call if
available.
<P>

If <I>outfd</I> is given, an attempt is made to write all the bytes just
read to the file descriptor <I>outfd</I>.  If this fails, because of a
system error other than <B>EINTR</B> or because of an internal zsh error
during an interrupt, the bytes read but not written are stored in the
parameter named by <I>param</I> if supplied (no default is used in this
case), and the number of bytes read but not written is stored in the
parameter named by <I>countvar</I> if that is supplied.  If it was
successful, <I>countvar</I> contains the full number of bytes transferred,
as usual, and <I>param</I> is not set.
<P>

The error <B>EINTR</B> (interrupted system call) is handled internally so
that shell interrupts are transparent to the caller.  Any other error
causes a return.
<P>

The possible return values are

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
0
At least one byte of data was successfully read and, if appropriate,
written.
<DT>1<DD>
There was an error in the parameters to the command.  This is the only
error for which a message is printed to standard error.
<DT>2<DD>
There was an error on the read, or on polling the input file descriptor
for a timeout.  The parameter <B>ERRNO</B> gives the error.
<DT>3<DD>
Data were successfully read, but there was an error writing them
to <I>outfd</I>.  The parameter <B>ERRNO</B> gives the error.
<DT>4<DD>
The attempt to read timed out.  Note this does not set <B>ERRNO</B> as this
is not a system error.
<DT>5<DD>
No system error occurred, but zero bytes were read.  This usually
indicates end of file.  The parameters are set according to the
usual rules; no write to <I>outfd</I> is attempted.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>syswrite [ -c</B> <I>countvar</I> <B>] [ -o</B> <I>outfd</I> <B>]</B> <I>data</I><DD>
The data (a single string of bytes) are written to the file descriptor
<I>outfd</I>, or 1 if that is not given, using the <B>write</B> system call.
Multiple write operations may be used if the first does not write all
the data.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <I>countvar</I> is given, the number of byte written is stored in the
parameter named by <I>countvar</I>; this may not be the full length of
<I>data</I> if an error occurred.
<P>

The error <B>EINTR</B> (interrupted system call) is handled internally by
retrying; otherwise an error causes the command to return.  For example,
if the file descriptor is set to non-blocking output, an error
<B>EAGAIN</B> (on some systems, <B>EWOULDBLOCK</B>) may result in the command
returning early.
<P>

The return status may be 0 for success, 1 for an error in the parameters
to the command, or 2 for an error on the write; no error message is
printed in the last case, but the parameter <B>ERRNO</B> will reflect
the error that occurred.

and outbound (<B>O</B>) connections this may be read and written by the usual
shell mechanisms.  However, it should only be close with `<B>ztcp -c</B>'.
<DT>Connection type<DD>
A letter indicating how the session was created:

<H3>Example</H3>

Here is how to create a TCP connection between two instances of zsh.  We
need to pick an unassigned port; here we use the randomly chosen 5123.
<P>

On <B>host1</B>,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zmodload zsh/net/tcp
ztcp -l 5123

<B>zmodload zsh/net/tcp
ztcp host1 5123

<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zftp</B> <I>subcommand</I> [ <I>args</I> ]
The <B>zsh/zftp</B> module is a client for FTP (file transfer protocol).  It
is implemented as a builtin to allow full use of shell command line
editing, file I/O, and job control mechanisms.  Often, users will
access it via shell functions providing a more powerful interface; a set is
provided with the <B>zsh</B> distribution and is described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshzftpsys.1.php">zshzftpsys</A></I>(1).  However, the <B>zftp</B> command is entirely usable in its
own right.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

All commands consist of the command name <B>zftp</B> followed by the name
of a subcommand.  These are listed below.  The return status of each
subcommand is supposed to reflect the success or failure of the remote
operation.  See a description of the variable <B>ZFTP_VERBOSE</B> for
more information on how responses from the server may be printed.

<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>open</B> <I>host</I> [ <I>user</I> [ <I>password</I> [ <I>account</I> ] ] ]
Open a new FTP session to <I>host</I>, which may be the name of a TCP/IP
connected host or an IP number in the standard dot notation.
Remaining arguments are passed to the <B>login</B> subcommand.  Note that
if no arguments beyond <I>host</I> are supplied, <B>open</B> will <I>not</I>
automatically call <B>login</B>.  If no arguments at all are supplied,
<B>open</B> will use the parameters set by the <B>params</B> subcommand.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

After a successful open, the shell variables <B>ZFTP_HOST</B>,
<B>ZFTP_IP</B> and <B>ZFTP_SYSTEM</B> are available; see `Variables'
below.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>login</B> [ <I>name</I> [ <I>password</I> [ <I>account</I> ] ] ]
<DT>
<DD>
<B>user</B> [ <I>name</I> [ <I>password</I> [ <I>account</I> ] ] ]
Login the user <I>name</I> with parameters <I>password</I> and <I>account</I>.
Any of the parameters can be omitted, and will be read from standard
input if needed (<I>name</I> is always needed).  If 
standard input is a terminal, a prompt for each one will be printed on
standard error and <I>password</I> will not be echoed.  If any of the
parameters are not used, a warning message is printed.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

After a successful login, the shell variables <B>ZFTP_USER</B>,
<B>ZFTP_ACCOUNT</B> and <B>ZFTP_PWD</B> are available; see `Variables'
below.
<P>

This command may be re-issued when a user is already logged in, and
the server will first be reinitialized for a new user.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>params</B> [ <I>host</I> [ <I>user</I> [ <I>password</I> [ <I>account</I> ] ] ] ]
<DT>
<DD>
<B>params</B> <B>-</B>
Store the given parameters for a later <B>open</B> command with no
arguments.  Only those given on the command line will be remembered.
If no arguments are given, the parameters currently set are printed,
although the password will appear as a line of stars; the return value is
one if no parameters were set, zero otherwise.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Any of the parameters may be specified as a `<B>?</B>', which
may need to be quoted to protect it from shell expansion.  In this case,
the appropriate parameter will be read from stdin as with the
<B>login</B> subcommand, including special handling of <I>password</I>.  If the
`<B>?</B>' is followed by a string, that is used as the prompt for reading the
parameter instead of the default message (any necessary punctuation and
whitespace should be included at the end of the prompt).  The first letter
of the parameter (only) may be quoted with a `<B>\</B>'; hence an argument
<B>&quot;\\$word&quot;</B> guarantees that the string from the shell parameter <B>$word</B>
will be treated literally, whether or not it begins with a `<B>?</B>'.
<P>

If instead a single `<B>-</B>' is given, the existing parameters, if any,
are deleted.  In that case, calling <B>open</B> with no arguments will
cause an error.
<P>

The list of parameters is not deleted after a <B>close</B>, however it
will be deleted if the <B>zsh/zftp</B> module is unloaded.
<P>

For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zftp params <A HREF="ftp://ftp.elsewhere.xx">ftp.elsewhere.xx</A> juser '?Password for juser: '</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will store the host <B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.elsewhere.xx">ftp.elsewhere.xx</A></B> and the user <B>juser</B> and
then prompt the user for the corresponding password with the given prompt.
</DL>

<DT><B>test</B><DD>
Test the connection; if the server has reported
that it has closed the connection (maybe due to a timeout), return
status 2; if no connection was open anyway, return status 1; else
return status 0.  The <B>test</B> subcommand is
silent, apart from messages printed by the <B>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</B>
mechanism, or error messages if the connection closes.  There is no
network overhead for this test.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The test is only supported on systems with either the <B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.php">select</A>(2)</B> or
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.php">poll</A>(2)</B> system calls; otherwise the message `<B>not
supported on this system</B>' is printed instead.
<P>

The <B>test</B> subcommand will automatically be called at the start of any
other subcommand for the current session when a connection is open.
</DL>

<DT><B>cd</B> <I>directory</I><DD>
Change the remote directory to <I>directory</I>.  Also alters the shell
variable <B>ZFTP_PWD</B>.
<DT><B>cdup</B><DD>
Change the remote directory to the one higher in the directory tree.
Note that <B>cd ..</B> will also work correctly on non-UNIX systems.
<DT><B>dir</B> [ <I>args...</I> ]<DD>
Give a (verbose) listing of the remote directory.  The <I>args</I> are
passed directly to the server. The command's behaviour is implementation
dependent, but a UNIX server will typically interpret <I>args</I> as
arguments to the <B>ls</B> command and with no arguments return the
result of `<B>ls -l</B>'. The directory is listed to standard output.
<DT><B>ls</B> [ <I>args</I> ]<DD>
Give a (short) listing of the remote directory.  With no <I>args</I>,
produces a raw list of the files in the directory, one per line.
Otherwise, up to vagaries of the server implementation, behaves
similar to <B>dir</B>.
<DT><B>type</B> [ <I>type</I> ]<DD>
Change the type for the transfer to <I>type</I>, or print the current type
if <I>type</I> is absent.  The allowed values are `<B>A</B>' (ASCII),
`<B>I</B>' (Image, i.e. binary), or `<B>B</B>' (a synonym for `<B>I</B>').
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The FTP default for a transfer is ASCII.  However, if <B>zftp</B> finds
that the remote host is a UNIX machine with 8-bit byes, it will
automatically switch to using binary for file transfers upon
<B>open</B>.  This can subsequently be overridden.
<P>

The transfer type is only passed to the remote host when a data
connection is established; this command involves no network overhead.
</DL>

<DT><B>ascii</B><DD>
The same as <B>type A</B>.
<DT><B>binary</B><DD>
The same as <B>type I</B>.
<DT><B>mode</B> [ <B>S</B> | <B>B</B> ]<DD>
Set the mode type to stream (<B>S</B>) or block (<B>B</B>).  Stream mode is
the default; block mode is not widely supported.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>remote</B> <I>files...</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>local</B> [ <I>files...</I> ]
Print the size and last modification time of the remote or local
files.  If there is more than one item on the list, the name of the
file is printed first.  The first number is the file size, the second
is the last modification time of the file in the format
<B>CCYYMMDDhhmmSS</B> consisting of year, month, date, hour, minutes and
seconds in GMT.  Note that this format, including the length, is
guaranteed, so that time strings can be directly compared via the
<B>[[</B> builtin's <B>&lt;</B> and <B>&gt;</B> operators, even if they are too long
to be represented as integers.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Not all servers support the commands for retrieving this information.
In that case, the <B>remote</B> command will print nothing and return
status 2, compared with status 1 for a file not found.
<P>

The <B>local</B> command (but not <B>remote</B>) may be used with no
arguments, in which case the information comes from examining file
descriptor zero.  This is the same file as seen by a <B>put</B> command
with no further redirection.
</DL>

<DT><B>get</B> <I>file</I> [...]<DD>
Retrieve all <I>file</I>s from the server, concatenating them
and sending them to standard output.
<DT><B>put</B> <I>file</I> [...]<DD>
For each <I>file</I>, read a file from standard input and send that to
the remote host with the given name.
<DT><B>append</B> <I>file</I> [...]<DD>
As <B>put</B>, but if the remote <I>file</I> already exists, data is
appended to it instead of overwriting it.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>getat</B> <I>file</I> <I>point</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>putat</B> <I>file</I> <I>point</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>appendat</B> <I>file</I> <I>point</I>
Versions of <B>get</B>, <B>put</B> and <B>append</B> which will start the
transfer at the given <I>point</I> in the remote <I>file</I>.  This is
useful for appending to an incomplete local file.  However, note that
this ability is not universally supported by servers (and is not quite
the behaviour specified by the standard).
<DT><B>delete</B> <I>file</I> [...]<DD>
Delete the list of files on the server.
<DT><B>mkdir</B> <I>directory</I><DD>
Create a new directory <I>directory</I> on the server.
<DT><B>rmdir</B> <I>directory</I><DD>
Delete the directory <I>directory</I>  on the server.
<DT><B>rename</B> <I>old-name</I> <I>new-name</I><DD>
Rename file <I>old-name</I> to <I>new-name</I> on the server.
<DT><B>site</B> <I>args...</I><DD>
Send a host-specific command to the server.  You will probably
only need this if instructed by the server to use it.
<DT><B>quote</B> <I>args...</I><DD>
Send the raw FTP command sequence to the server.  You should be
familiar with the FTP command set as defined in RFC959 before doing
this.  Useful commands may include <B>STAT</B> and <B>HELP</B>.  Note also
the mechanism for returning messages as described for the variable
<B>ZFTP_VERBOSE</B> below, in particular that all messages from the
control connection are sent to standard error.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>close</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>quit</B>
Close the current data connection.  This unsets the shell parameters
<B>ZFTP_HOST</B>, <B>ZFTP_IP</B>, <B>ZFTP_SYSTEM</B>, <B>ZFTP_USER</B>,
<B>ZFTP_ACCOUNT</B>, <B>ZFTP_PWD</B>, <B>ZFTP_TYPE</B> and <B>ZFTP_MODE</B>.
<DT><B>session</B> [ <I>sessname</I> ]<DD>
Allows multiple FTP sessions to be used at once.  The name of the session
is an arbitrary string of characters; the default session is called
`<B>default</B>'.  If this command is called without an argument, it will list
all the current sessions; with an argument, it will either switch to the
existing session called <I>sessname</I>, or create a new session of that name.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Each session remembers the status of the connection, the set of
connection-specific shell parameters (the same set as are unset when a
connection closes, as given in the description of <B>close</B>), and any user
parameters specified with the <B>params</B> subcommand.  Changing to a
previous session restores those values; changing to a new session
initialises them in the same way as if <B>zftp</B> had just been loaded.  The
name of the current session is given by the parameter <B>ZFTP_SESSION</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>rmsession</B> [ <I>sessname</I> ]<DD>
Delete a session; if a name is not given, the current session is deleted.
If the current session is deleted, the earliest existing session becomes
the new current session, otherwise the current session is not changed.
If the session being deleted is the only one, a new session called
`<B>default</B>' is created and becomes the current session; note that this is
a new session even if the session being deleted is also called
`<B>default</B>'. It is recommended that sessions not be deleted while
background commands which use <B>zftp</B> are still active.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbGO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Parameters</H3>

The following shell parameters are used by <B>zftp</B>.  Currently none
of them are special.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>ZFTP_TMOUT</B>
Integer.  The time in seconds to wait for a network operation to
complete before returning an error.  If this is not set when the
module is loaded, it will be given the default value 60.  A value of
zero turns off timeouts.  If a timeout occurs on the control
connection it will be closed.  Use a larger value if this occurs too
frequently.
<DT><B>ZFTP_IP</B><DD>
Readonly.  The IP address of the current connection in dot notation.
<DT><B>ZFTP_HOST</B><DD>
Readonly.  The hostname of the current remote server.  If the host was
opened as an IP number, <B>ZFTP_HOST</B> contains that instead; this
saves the overhead for a name lookup, as IP numbers are most commonly
used when a nameserver is unavailable.
<DT><B>ZFTP_SYSTEM</B><DD>
Readonly.  The system type string returned by the server in response
to an FTP <B>SYST</B> request.  The most interesting case is a string
beginning <B>&quot;UNIX Type: L8&quot;</B>, which ensures maximum compatibility
with a local UNIX host.
<DT><B>ZFTP_TYPE</B><DD>
Readonly.  The type to be used for data transfers , either `<B>A</B>' or
`<B>I</B>'.   Use the <B>type</B> subcommand to change this.
<DT><B>ZFTP_USER</B><DD>
Readonly.  The username currently logged in, if any.
<DT><B>ZFTP_ACCOUNT</B><DD>
Readonly.  The account name of the current user, if any.  Most servers
do not require an account name.
<DT><B>ZFTP_PWD</B><DD>
Readonly.  The current directory on the server.
<DT><B>ZFTP_CODE</B><DD>
Readonly.  The three digit code of the last FTP reply from the server
as a string.  This can still be read after the connection is closed, and
is not changed when the current session changes.
<DT><B>ZFTP_REPLY</B><DD>
Readonly.  The last line of the last reply sent by the server.  This
can still be read after the connection is closed, and is not changed when
the current session changes.
<DT><B>ZFTP_SESSION</B><DD>
Readonly.  The name of the current FTP session; see the description of the
<B>session</B> subcommand.
<DT><B>ZFTP_PREFS</B><DD>
A string of preferences for altering aspects of <B>zftp</B>'s behaviour.
Each preference is a single character.  The following are defined:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>P</B>
Passive:  attempt to make the remote server initiate data transfers.
This is slightly more efficient than sendport mode.  If the letter
<B>S</B> occurs later in the string, <B>zftp</B> will use sendport mode if
passive mode is not available.
<DT><B>S</B><DD>
Sendport:  initiate transfers by the FTP <B>PORT</B> command.  If this
occurs before any <B>P</B> in the string, passive mode will never be
attempted.
<DT><B>D</B><DD>
Dumb:  use only the bare minimum of FTP commands.  This prevents
the variables <B>ZFTP_SYSTEM</B> and <B>ZFTP_PWD</B> from being set, and
will mean all connections default to ASCII type.  It may prevent
<B>ZFTP_SIZE</B> from being set during a transfer if the server
does not send it anyway (many servers do).
</DL>
<P>

If <B>ZFTP_PREFS</B> is not set when <B>zftp</B> is loaded, it will be set to a
default of `<B>PS</B>', i.e. use passive mode if available, otherwise
fall back to sendport mode.
</DL>

<DT><B>ZFTP_VERBOSE</B><DD>
A string of digits between 0 and 5 inclusive, specifying which
responses from the server should be printed.  All responses go to
standard error.  If any of the numbers 1 to 5 appear in the string,
raw responses from the server with reply codes beginning with that
digit will be printed to standard error.  The first digit of the three
digit reply code is defined by RFC959 to correspond to:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
1.
A positive preliminary reply.
<DT>2.<DD>
A positive completion reply.
<DT>3.<DD>
A positive intermediate reply.
<DT>4.<DD>
A transient negative completion reply.
<DT>5.<DD>
A permanent negative completion reply.
</DL>
<P>

It should be noted that, for unknown reasons, the reply `Service not
available', which forces termination of a connection, is classified as
421, i.e. `transient negative', an interesting interpretation of the word
`transient'.
<P>

The code 0 is special:  it indicates that all but the last line of
multiline replies read from the server will be printed to standard

If <B>ZFTP_VERBOSE</B> is not set when <B>zftp</B> is loaded, it will be

<DL COMPACT>

<DD>
<B>zftp_chpwd</B>
If this function is set by the user, it is called every time the
directory changes on the server, including when a user is logged
in, or when a connection is closed.  In the last case, <B>$ZFTP_PWD</B>
will be unset; otherwise it will reflect the new directory.
<DT><B>zftp_progress</B><DD>
If this function is set by the user, it will be called during
a <B>get</B>, <B>put</B> or <B>append</B> operation each time sufficient data
has been received from the host.  During a <B>get</B>, the data is sent
to standard output, so it is vital that this function should write
to standard error or directly to the terminal, <I>not</I> to standard
output.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When it is called with a transfer in progress, the following
additional shell parameters are set:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>ZFTP_FILE</B>
The name of the remote file being transferred from or to.
<DT><B>ZFTP_TRANSFER</B><DD>
A <B>G</B> for a <B>get</B> operation and a <B>P</B> for a <B>put</B> operation.
<DT><B>ZFTP_SIZE</B><DD>
The total size of the complete file being transferred:
the same as the first value provided by the
<B>remote</B> and <B>local</B> subcommands for a particular file.
If the server cannot supply this value for a remote file being
retrieved, it will not be set.  If input is from a pipe the value may
be incorrect and correspond simply to a full pipe buffer.
<DT><B>ZFTP_COUNT</B><DD>
The amount of data so far transferred; a number between zero and
<B>$ZFTP_SIZE</B>, if that is set.  This number is always available.
</DL>
<P>

The function is initially called with <B>ZFTP_TRANSFER</B> set
appropriately and <B>ZFTP_COUNT</B> set to zero.  After the transfer is
finished, the function will be called one more time with
<B>ZFTP_TRANSFER</B> set to <B>GF</B> or <B>PF</B>, in case it wishes to tidy
up.  It is otherwise never called twice with the same value of
<B>ZFTP_COUNT</B>.
<P>

Sometimes the progress meter may cause disruption.  It is up to the
user to decide whether the function should be defined and to use
<B>unfunction</B> when necessary.

<H3>Problems</H3>

<P>

A connection may not be opened in the left hand side of a pipe as this
occurs in a subshell and the file information is not updated in the main
shell.  In the case of type or mode changes or closing the connection in a
subshell, the information is returned but variables are not updated until
the next call to <B>zftp</B>.  Other status changes in subshells will not be
reflected by changes to the variables (but should be otherwise harmless).
<P>

Deleting sessions while a <B>zftp</B> command is active in the background can
have unexpected effects, even if it does not use the session being deleted.
This is because all shell subprocesses share information on the state of
all connections, and deleting a session changes the ordering of that
information.
<P>

On some operating systems, the control connection is not valid after a
fork(), so that operations in subshells, on the left hand side of a
pipeline, or in the background are not possible, as they should be.  This
is presumably a bug in the operating system.

<B>keymaps</B>
This array contains the names of the keymaps currently defined.
<DT><B>widgets</B><DD>
This associative array contains one entry per widget defined. The name 
of the widget is the key and the value gives information about the
widget. It is either the string `<B>builtin</B>' for builtin widgets, a
string of the form `<B>user:</B><I>name</I>' for user-defined widgets,
where <I>name</I> is the name of the shell function implementing the
widget, or it is a string of the form
`<B>completion:</B><I>type</I><B>:</B><I>name</I>', for completion widgets. In
the last case <I>type</I> is the name of the builtin widgets the
completion widget imitates in its behavior and <I>name</I> is the name
of the shell function implementing the completion widget.

<H2>THE ZSH/ZPROF MODULE</H2>


<P>
When loaded, the <B>zsh/zprof</B> causes shell functions to be profiled.
The profiling results can be obtained with the <B>zprof</B>
builtin command made available by this module.  There is no way to turn 
profiling off other than unloading the module.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zprof</B> [ <B>-c</B> ]
Without the <B>-c</B> option, <B>zprof</B> lists profiling results to
standard output.  The format is comparable to that of commands like
<B>gprof</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

At the top there is a summary listing all functions that were called
at least once.  This summary is sorted in decreasing order of the
amount of time spent in each.  The lines contain
the number of the function in order, which is used in 
other parts of the list in suffixes of the form
`<B>[</B><I>num</I><B>]</B>'.RE, then the number of calls made to the function.
The next three columns list the time in
milliseconds spent in the function and its descendents, the average
time in milliseconds spent in the function and its descendents per
call and the percentage of time spent in all shell functions used in
this function and its descendents.  The following three columns give
the same information, but counting only the time spent in the function 
itself.  The final column shows the name of the function.
<P>

After the summary, detailed information about every function that was
invoked is listed, sorted in decreasing order of the amount of time spent
in each function and its descendents.  Each of these entries consists of
descriptions for the functions that called the function described, the
function itself, and the functions that were called from it.  The
description for the function itself has the same format as in the summary
(and shows the same information).  The other lines don't show the number of
the function at the beginning and have their function named indented to
make it easier to distinguish the line showing the function described in
the section from the surrounding lines.
<P>

The information shown in this case is almost the same as in the summary,
but only refers to the call hierarchy being displayed.  For example, for a
calling function the column showing the total running time lists the time
spent in the described function and its descendents only for the times when
it was called from that particular calling function.  Likewise, for a
called function, this columns lists the total time spent in the called
function and its descendents only for the times when it was called from the
function described.
<P>

Also in this case, the column showing the number of calls to a function
also shows a slash and then the total number of invocations made to the
called function.
<P>

As long as the <B>zsh/zprof</B> module is loaded, profiling will be done and
multiple invocations of the <B>zprof</B> builtin command will show the
times and numbers of calls since the module was loaded.  With the
<B>-c</B> option, the <B>zprof</B> builtin command will reset its internal
counters and will not show the listing.

<H2>THE ZSH/ZPTY MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/zpty</B> module offers one builtin:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zpty</B> [ <B>-e</B> ] [ <B>-b</B> ] <I>name</I> [ <I>arg ...</I> ]
The arguments following <I>name</I> are concatenated with spaces between,
then executed as a command, as if passed to the <B>eval</B> builtin.  The
command runs under a newly assigned pseudo-terminal; this is useful for
running commands non-interactively which expect an interactive
environment.  The <I>name</I> is not part of the command, but is used to
refer to this command in later calls to <B>zpty</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With the <B>-e</B> option, the pseudo-terminal is set up so that input
characters are echoed.
<P>

With the <B>-b</B> option, input to and output from the pseudo-terminal are
made non-blocking.
</DL>

<DT><B>zpty</B> <B>-d</B> [ <I>names</I> ... ]<DD>
The second form, with the <B>-d</B> option, is used to delete commands
previously started, by supplying a list of their <I>name</I>s.  If no
<I>names</I> are given, all commands are deleted.  Deleting a command causes
the HUP signal to be sent to the corresponding process.
<DT><B>zpty</B> <B>-w</B> [ <B>-n</B> ] <I>name</I> [ <I>strings ...</I> ]<DD>
The <B>-w</B> option can be used to send the to command <I>name</I> the given
<I>strings</I> as input (separated by spaces).  If the <B>-n</B> option is
<I>not</I> given, a newline is added at the end.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If no <I>strings</I> are provided, the standard input is copied to the
pseudo-terminal; this may stop before copying the full input if the
pseudo-terminal is non-blocking.
<P>

Note that the command under the pseudo-terminal sees this input as if it
were typed, so beware when sending special tty driver characters such as
word-erase, line-kill, and end-of-file.
</DL>

<DT><B>zpty</B> <B>-r</B> [ <B>-t</B> ] <I>name</I> [ <I>param</I> [ <I>pattern</I> ] ]<DD>
The <B>-r</B> option can be used to read the output of the command <I>name</I>.
With only a <I>name</I> argument, the output read is copied to the standard
output.  Unless the pseudo-terminal is non-blocking, copying continues
until the command under the pseudo-terminal exits; when non-blocking, only
as much output as is immediately available is copied.  The return value is
zero if any output is copied.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When also given a <I>param</I> argument, at most one line is read and stored
in the parameter named <I>param</I>.  Less than a full line may be read if
the pseudo-terminal is non-blocking.  The return value is zero if at least
one character is stored in <I>param</I>.
<P>

If a <I>pattern</I> is given as well, output is read until the whole string
read matches the <I>pattern</I>, even in the non-blocking case.  The return
value is zero if the string read matches the pattern, or if the command
has exited but at least one character could still be read.  As of this
writing, a maximum of one megabyte of output can be consumed this way; if
a full megabyte is read without matching the pattern, the return value is
non-zero.
<P>

In all cases, the return value is non-zero if nothing could be read, and
is <B>2</B> if this is because the command has finished.
<P>

If the <B>-r</B> option is combined with the <B>-t</B> option, <B>zpty</B> tests
whether output is available before trying to read.  If no output is
available, <B>zpty</B> immediately returns the value <B>1</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>zpty</B> <B>-t</B> <I>name</I><DD>
The <B>-t</B> option without the <B>-r</B> option can be used to test
whether the command <I>name</I> is still running.  It returns a zero
value if the command is running and a non-zero value otherwise.
<DT><B>zpty</B> [ <B>-L</B> ]<DD>
The last form, without any arguments, is used to list the commands
currently defined.  If the <B>-L</B> option is given, this is done in the
form of calls to the <B>zpty</B> builtin.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbGV">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>THE ZSH/ZSELECT MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/zselect</B> module makes available one builtin command:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zselect</B> [ <B>-rwe</B> <B>-t</B> <I>timeout</I> <B>-a</B> <I>array</I> ] [ <I>fd</I> ... ]
The <B>zselect</B> builtin is a front-end to the `select' system call, which
blocks until a file descriptor is ready for reading or writing, or has an
error condition, with an optional timeout.  If this is not available on
your system, the command prints an error message and returns status 2
(normal errors return status 1).  For more information, see your systems
documentation for <I><A HREF="../man3/select.3.php">select</A></I>(3).  Note there is no connection with the
shell builtin of the same name.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Arguments and options may be intermingled in any order.  Non-option
arguments are file descriptors, which must be decimal integers.  By
default, file descriptors are to be tested for reading, i.e. <B>zselect</B>
will return when data is available to be read from the file descriptor, or
more precisely, when a read operation from the file descriptor will not
block.  After a <B>-r</B>, <B>-w</B> and <B>-e</B>, the given file descriptors are
to be tested for reading, writing, or error conditions.  These options and
an arbitrary list of file descriptors may be given in any order.
<P>

(The presence of an `error condition' is not well defined in the
documentation for many implementations of the select system call.
According to recent versions of the POSIX specification, it is really an
<I>exception</I> condition, of which the only standard example is out-of-band
data received on a socket.  So zsh users are unlikely to find the <B>-e</B>
option useful.)
<P>

The option `<B>-t</B> <I>timeout</I>' specifies a timeout in hundredths of a
second.  This may be zero, in which case the file descriptors will simply
be polled and <B>zselect</B> will return immediately.  It is possible to call
zselect with no file descriptors and a non-zero timeout for use as a
finer-grained replacement for `sleep'; not, however, the return status is
always 1 for a timeout.
<P>

The option `<B>-a</B> <I>array</I>' indicates that <B>array</B> should be set to
indicate the file descriptor(s) which are ready.  If the option is not
given, the array <B>reply</B> will be used for this purpose.  The array will
contain a string similar to the arguments for <B>zselect</B>.  For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zselect -t 0 -r 0 -w 1</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

might return immediately with status 0 and <B>$reply</B> containing `<B>-r 0 -w
1</B>' to show that both file descriptors are ready for the requested
operations.
<P>

The option `<B>-A</B> <I>assoc</I>' indicates that the associative array
<B>assoc</B> should be set to indicate the file descriptor(s) which are
ready.  This option overrides the option <B>-a</B>, nor will <B>reply</B> be
modified.  The keys of <B>assoc</B> are the file descriptors, and the
corresponding values are any of the characters `<B>rwe</B>' to indicate the
condition.
<P>

The command returns 0 if some file descriptors are ready for reading.  If
the operation timed out, or a timeout of 0 was given and no file
descriptors were ready, or there was an error, it returns status 1 and
the array will not be set (nor modified in any way).  If there was an error
in the select operation the appropriate error message is printed.

<H2>THE ZSH/ZUTIL MODULE</H2>


<P>
The <B>zsh/zutil</B> module only adds some builtins:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zstyle</B> [ <B>-L</B> ]
<DT>

<B>zstyle</B> [ <B>-e</B> | <B>-</B> | <B>-</B><B>-</B> ] <I>pattern</I> <I>style</I> <I>strings</I> ...

<B>zstyle -abs</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> <I>name</I> [ <I>sep</I> ]
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zstyle -Tt</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> [ <I>strings</I> ...]
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zstyle -m</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> <I>pattern</I>
This builtin command is used to define and lookup styles.  Styles are
pairs of names and values, where the values consist of any number of
strings.  They are stored together with patterns and lookup is done by
giving a string, called the `context', which is compared to the
patterns.  The definition stored for the first matching pattern will be 
returned.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

For ordering of comparisons, patterns are searched from most specific to
least specific, and patterns that are equally specific keep the order in 
which they were defined.  A pattern is considered to be more specific
than another if it contains more components (substrings separated by
colons) or if the patterns for the components are more specific, where 
simple strings are considered to be more specific than patterns and
complex patterns are considered to be more specific than the pattern
`<B>*</B>'.
<P>

The first form (without arguments) lists the definitions in the order
<B>zstyle</B> will test them. If the <B>-L</B> option is given, listing is
done in the form of calls to <B>zstyle</B>.  Forms with arguments:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zstyle</B> [ <B>-</B> | <B>-</B><B>-</B> | <B>-e</B> ] <I>pattern</I> <I>style</I> <I>strings</I> ...
Defines the given <I>style</I> for the <I>pattern</I> with the <I>strings</I> as
the value.  If the <B>-e</B> option is given, the <I>strings</I> will be
concatenated (separated by spaces) and the resulting string will be
evaluated (in the same way as it is done by the <B>eval</B> builtin
command) when the style is looked up.  In this case the parameter
`<B>reply</B>' must be assigned to set the strings returned after the
evaluation.  Before evaluating the value, <B>reply</B> is unset, and
if it is still unset after the evaluation, the style is treated as if
it were not set.
<DT><B>zstyle -d</B> [ <I>pattern</I> [ <I>styles</I> ... ] ]<DD>
Delete style definitions. Without arguments all definitions are deleted,
with a <I>pattern</I> all definitions for that pattern are deleted and if
any <I>styles</I> are given, then only those styles are deleted for the
<I>pattern</I>.
<DT><B>zstyle -g</B> <I>name</I> [ <I>pattern</I> [ <I>style</I> ] ]<DD>
Retrieve a style definition. The <I>name</I> is
used as the name of an array in which the results are stored. Without
any further arguments, all <I>patterns</I> defined are returned. With a
<I>pattern</I> the styles defined for that pattern are returned and with 
both a <I>pattern</I> and a <I>style</I>, the value strings of that
combination is returned.
</DL>
<P>

The other forms can be used to look up or test patterns.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zstyle -s</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> <I>name</I> [ <I>sep</I> ]
The parameter <I>name</I> is set to the value of the style interpreted as a
string.  If the value contains several strings they are concatenated with
spaces (or with the <I>sep</I> string if that is given) between them.
<DT><B>zstyle -b</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> <I>name</I><DD>
The value is stored in <I>name</I> as a boolean, i.e. as the string
`<B>yes</B>' if the value has only one string and that string is equal to one
of `<B>yes</B>', `<B>true</B>', `<B>on</B>', or `<B>1</B>'. If the value is any other
string or has more than one string, the parameter is set to `<B>no</B>'.
<DT><B>zstyle -a</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> <I>name</I><DD>
The value is stored in <I>name</I> as an array. If <I>name</I> is declared 
as an associative array,  the first, third, etc. strings are used as the
keys and the other strings are used as the values.
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zstyle -t</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> [ <I>strings</I> ...]
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zstyle -T</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> [ <I>strings</I> ...]
Test the value of a style, i.e. the <B>-t</B> option only returns a status
(sets <B>$?</B>).  Without any <I>strings</I> the return status is zero if the
style is defined for at least one matching pattern, has only one string in
its value, and that is equal to one of `<B>true</B>', `<B>yes</B>', `<B>on</B>' or
`<B>1</B>'. If any <I>strings</I> are given the status is zero if and only if
at least one of the <I>strings</I> is equal to at least one of the strings
in the value. If the style is not defined, the status is <B>2</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>-T</B> option tests the values of the style like <B>-t</B>, but it
returns zero (rather than <B>2</B>) if the style is not defined for any
matching pattern.
</DL>

<DT><B>zstyle -m</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> <I>pattern</I><DD>
Match a value. Returns status zero if the 
<I>pattern</I> matches at least one of the strings in the value.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>zformat -f</B> <I>param</I> <I>format</I> <I>specs</I> ...
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zformat -a</B> <I>array</I> <I>sep</I> <I>specs</I> ...
This builtin provides two different forms of formatting. The first form 
is selected with the <B>-f</B> option. In this case the <I>format</I>
string will be modified by replacing sequences starting with a percent 
sign in it with strings from the <I>specs</I>.  Each <I>spec</I> should be
of the form `<I>char</I><B>:</B><I>string</I>' which will cause every
appearance of the sequence `<B>%</B><I>char</I>' in <I>format</I> to be replaced 
by the <I>string</I>.  The `<B>%</B>' sequence may also contain optional
minimum and maximum field width specifications between the `<B>%</B>' and 
the `<I>char</I>' in the form `<B>%</B><I>min</I><B>.</B><I>max</I><B>c</B>',
i.e. the minimum field width is given first and if the maximum field
width is used, it has to be preceded by a dot.  Specifying a minimum field
width makes the result be padded with spaces to the right if the
<I>string</I> is shorter than the requested width.  Padding to the left
can be achieved by giving a negative minimum field width.  If a maximum 
field width is specified, the <I>string</I> will be truncated after that
many characters.  After all `<B>%</B>' sequences for the given <I>specs</I>
have been processed, the resulting string is stored in the parameter
<I>param</I>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>%</B>-escapes also understand ternary expressions in the form used by
prompts.  The <B>%</B> is followed by a `<B>(</B>' and then an ordinary
format specifier character as described above.  There may be a set of
digits either before or after the `<B>(</B>'; these specify a test
number, which defaults to zero.  Negative numbers are also allowed.  An
arbitrary delimiter character follows the format specifier, which is
followed by a piece of `true' text, the delimiter character again, a piece
of `false' text, and a closing parenthesis.  The complete expression
(without the digits) thus looks like
`<B>%(</B><I>X</I><B>.</B><I>text1</I><B>.</B><I>text2</I><B>)</B>', except that
the `<B>.</B>' character is arbitrary.  The value given for the format
specifier in the <I>char</I><B>:</B><I>string</I> expressions is evaluated as a
mathematical expression, and compared with the test number.  If they are
the same, <I>text1</I> is output, else <I>text2</I> is output.  A parenthesis
may be escaped in <I>text2</I> as <B>%)</B>.  Either of <I>text1</I> or
<I>text2</I> may contain nested <B>%</B>-escapes.
<P>

For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zformat -f REPLY &quot;The answer is '%3(c.yes.no)'.&quot; c:3</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

outputs &quot;The answer is 'yes'.&quot; to <B>REPLY</B> since the value for the format
specifier <B>c</B> is 3, agreeing with the digit argument to the ternary
expression.
<P>

The second form, using the <B>-a</B> option, can be used for aligning
strings.  Here, the <I>specs</I> are of the form
`<I>left</I><B>:</B><I>right</I>' where `<I>left</I>' and `<I>right</I>' are
arbitrary strings.  These strings are modified by replacing the colons
by the <I>sep</I> string and padding the <I>left</I> strings with spaces 
to the right so that the <I>sep</I> strings in the result (and hence the 
<I>right</I> strings after them) are all aligned if the strings are
printed below each other.  All strings without a colon are left
unchanged and all strings with an empty <I>right</I> string have the
trailing colon removed.  In both cases the lengths of the strings
are not used to determine how the other strings are to be aligned.
The resulting strings are stored in the <I>array</I>.

This implements some internals of the <B>_regex_arguments</B> function.
<DT><B>zparseopts</B> [ <B>-D</B> ] [ <B>-K</B> ] [ <B>-E</B> ] [ <B>-a</B> <I>array</I> ] [ <B>-A</B> <I>assoc</I> ] <I>specs</I><DD>
This builtin simplifies the parsing of options in positional parameters,
i.e. the set of arguments given by <B>$*</B>.  Each <I>spec</I> describes one
option and must be of the form `<I>opt</I>[<B>=</B><I>array</I>]'.  If an option
described by <I>opt</I> is found in the positional parameters it is copied
into the <I>array</I> specified with the <B>-a</B> option; if the optional
`<B>=</B><I>array</I>' is given, it is instead copied into that array.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that it is an error to give any <I>spec</I> without an
`<B>=</B><I>array</I>' unless one of the <B>-a</B> or <B>-A</B> options is used.
<P>

Unless the <B>-E</B> option is given, parsing stops at the first string
that isn't described by one of the <I>specs</I>.  Even with <B>-E</B>,
parsing always stops at a positional parameter equal to `<B>-</B>' or
`<B>-</B><B>-</B>'.
<P>

The <I>opt</I> description must be one of the following.  Any of the special
characters can appear in the option name provided it is preceded by a
backslash.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>name</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>name</I><B>+</B>
The <I>name</I> is the name of the option without the leading `<B>-</B>'.  To
specify a GNU-style long option, one of the usual two leading `<B>-</B>' must
be included in <I>name</I>; for example, a `<B>--file</B>' option is
represented by a <I>name</I> of `<B>-file</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If a `<B>+</B>' appears after <I>name</I>, the option is appended to <I>array</I>
each time it is found in the positional parameters; without the `<B>+</B>'
only the <I>last</I> occurrence of the option is preserved.
<P>

If one of these forms is used, the option takes no argument, so parsing
stops if the next positional parameter does not also begin with `<B>-</B>'
(unless the <B>-E</B> option is used).
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<I>name</I><B>:</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>name</I><B>:-</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<I>name</I><B>::</B>
If one or two colons are given, the option takes an argument; with one
colon, the argument is mandatory and with two colons it is optional.  The
argument is appended to the <I>array</I> after the option itself.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

An optional argument is put into the same array element as the option name
(note that this makes empty strings as arguments indistinguishable).  A
mandatory argument is added as a separate element unless the `<B>:-</B>' form
is used, in which case the argument is put into the same element.
<P>

A `<B>+</B>' as described above may appear between the <I>name</I> and the
first colon.
</DL>

</DL>

</DL>
<P>

The options of <B>zparseopts</B> itself are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-a</B> <I>array</I>
As described above, this names the default array in which to store the
recognised options.
<DT><B>-A</B> <I>assoc</I><DD>
If this is given, the options and their values are also put into an
associative array with the option names as keys and the arguments (if any)
as the values.
<DT><B>-D</B><DD>
If this option is given, all options found are removed from the positional
parameters of the calling shell or shell function, up to but not including
any not described by the <I>specs</I>.  This is similar to using the <B>shift</B>
builtin.
<DT><B>-K</B><DD>
With this option, the arrays specified with the <B>-a</B> and <B>-A</B>
options and with the `<B>=</B><I>array</I>' forms are kept unchanged when none
of the <I>specs</I> for them is used.  This allows assignment of default
values to them before calling <B>zparseopts</B>.
<DT><B>-E</B><DD>
This changes the parsing rules to <I>not</I> stop at the first string
that isn't described by one of the <I>spec</I>s.  It can be used to test
for or (if used together with <B>-D</B>) extract options and their
arguments, ignoring all other options and arguments that may be in the
positional parameters.
</DL>
<P>

For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>set -- -a -bx -c y -cz baz -cend
zparseopts a=foo b:=bar c+:=bar</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will have the effect of
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>foo=(-a)
bar=(-b x -c y -c z)</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The arguments from `<B>baz</B>' on will not be used.
<P>

As an example for the <B>-E</B> option, consider:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>set -- -a x -b y -c z arg1 arg2
zparseopts -E -D b:=bar</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bar=(-b y)
set -- -a x -c z arg1 arg2</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

I.e., the option <B>-b</B> and its arguments are taken from the
positional parameters and put into the array <B>bar</B>.

<H2>NAME</H2>

zshtcpsys - zsh tcp system

<A NAME="lbGY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

A module <B>zsh/net/tcp</B> is provided to provide network I/O over
TCP/IP from within the shell; see its description in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)
.  This manual page describes a function suite based on the module.  
If the module is installed, the functions are usually installed at the
same time, in which case they will be available for
autoloading in the default function search path.  In addition to the
<B>zsh/net/tcp</B> module, the <B>zsh/zselect</B> module is used to implement
timeouts on read operations.  For troubleshooting tips, consult the
corresponding advice for the <B>zftp</B> functions described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshftpsys.1.php">zshftpsys</A></I>(1)
.
<P>

There are functions corresponding to the basic I/O operations open, close,
read and send, named <B>tcp_open</B> etc., as well as a function
<B>tcp_expect</B> for pattern match analysis of data read as input.  The
system makes it easy to receive data from and send data to multiple named
sessions at once.  In addition, it can be linked with the shell's line
editor in such a way that input data is automatically shown at the
terminal.  Other facilities available including logging, filtering and
configurable output prompts.
<P>

To use the system where it is available, it should be enough to
`<B>autoload -U tcp_open</B>' and run <B>tcp_open</B> as documented below to
start a session.  The <B>tcp_open</B> function will autoload the remaining
functions.

<DD>
<B>tcp_open [-qz] [-a</B> <I>fd</I> <B>| -f</B> <I>fd</I> <B>] [</B> <I>sess</I> <B>]</B>
Open a new session.  In the first and simplest form, open a TCP connection
to host <I>host</I> at port <I>port</I>; numeric and symbolic forms are
understood for both.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <I>sess</I> is given, this becomes the name of the session which can be
used to refer to multiple different TCP connections.  If <I>sess</I> is
not given, the function will invent a numeric name value (note this is
<I>not</I> the same as the file descriptor to which the session is attached).
It is recommended that session names not include `funny' characters, where
funny characters are not well-defined but certainly do not include
alphanumerics or underscores, and certainly do include whitespace.
<P>

In the second case, one or more sessions to be opened are given by name.
A single session name is given after <B>-s</B> and a comma-separated list
after <B>-l</B>; both options may be repeated as many times as necessary.
The host and port are read from the file <B>.ztcp_sessions</B> in the same
directory as the user's zsh initialisation files, i.e. usually the home
directory, but <B>$ZDOTDIR</B> if that is set.  The file consists of lines
each giving a session name and the corresponding host and port, in that
order (note the session name comes first, not last), separated by
whitespace.
<P>

The third form allows passive and fake TCP connections.  If the option
<B>-a</B> is used, its argument is a file descriptor open for listening for
connections.  No function front-end is provided to open such a file
descriptor, but a call to `<B>ztcp -l</B> <I>port</I>' will create one with the
file descriptor stored in the parameter <B>$REPLY</B>.  The listening port can
be closed with `<B>ztcp -c</B> <I>fd</I>'.  A call to `<B>tcp_open -a</B> <I>fd</I>'
will block until a remote TCP connection is made to <I>port</I> on the local
machine.  At this point, a session is created in the usual way and is
largely indistinguishable from an active connection created with one of the
first two forms.
<P>

If the option <B>-f</B> is used, its argument is a file descriptor which is
used directly as if it were a TCP session.  How well the remainder of the
TCP function system copes with this depends on what actually underlies this
file descriptor.  A regular file is likely to be unusable; a FIFO (pipe) of
some sort will work better, but note that it is not a good idea for two
different sessions to attempt to read from the same FIFO at once.
<P>

If the option <B>-q</B> is given with any of the three forms, <B>tcp_open</B>
will not print informational messages, although it will in any case exit
with an appropriate status.
<P>

If the line editor (zle) is in use, which is typically the case if the
shell is interactive, <B>tcp_open</B> installs a handler inside <B>zle</B> which
will check for new data at the same time as it checks for keyboard input.
This is convenient as the shell consumes no CPU time while waiting; the
test is performed by the operating system.  Giving the option <B>-z</B> to
any of the forms of <B>tcp_open</B> prevents the handler from being
installed, so data must be read explicitly.  Note, however, this is not
necessary for executing complete sets of send and read commands from a
function, as zle is not active at this point.  Generally speaking, the
handler is only active when the shell is waiting for input at a command
prompt or in the <B>vared</B> builtin.  The option has no effect if zle is not
active; `<B>[[ -o zle]]</B>' will test for this.
<P>

The first session to be opened becomes the current session and subsequent
calls to <B>tcp_open</B> do not change it.  The current session is stored
in the parameter <B>$TCP_SESS</B>; see below for more detail about the
parameters used by the system.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_close [-qn] [ -a | -l</B> <I>sess</I><B>,... |</B> <I>sess</I> <B>... ]</B><DD>
Close the named sessions, or the current session if none is given,
or all open sessions if <B>-a</B> is given.  The options <B>-l</B> and <B>-s</B> are
both handled for consistency with <B>tcp_open</B>, although the latter is
redundant.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the session being closed is the current one, <B>$TCP_SESS</B> is unset,
leaving no current session, even if there are other sessions still open.
<P>

If the session was opened with <B>tcp_open -f</B>, the file descriptor is
closed so long as it is in the range 0 to 9 accessible directly from the
command line.  If the option <B>-n</B> is given, no attempt will be made to
close file descriptors in this case.  The <B>-n</B> option is not used for
genuine <B>ztcp</B> session; the file descriptors are always closed with the
session.
<P>

If the option <B>-q</B> is given, no informational messages will be printed.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>tcp_read [-bdq] [ -t</B> <I>TO</I> <B>] [ -T</B> <I>TO</I> <B>]</B>

Perform a read operation on the current session, or on a list of
sessions if any are given with <B>-u</B>, <B>-l</B> or <B>-s</B>, or all open
sessions if the option <B>-a</B> is given.  Any of the <B>-u</B>, <B>-l</B> or
<B>-s</B> options may be repeated or mixed together.  The <B>-u</B> option
specifies a file descriptor directly (only those managed by this system
are useful), the other two specify sessions as described for
<B>tcp_open</B> above.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The function checks for new data available on all the sessions listed.
Unless the <B>-b</B> option is given, it will not block waiting for new data.
Any one line of data from any of the available sessions will be read,
stored in the parameter <B>$TCP_LINE</B>, and displayed to standard output
unless <B>$TCP_SILENT</B> contains a non-empty string.  When printed to
standard output the string <B>$TCP_PROMPT</B> will be shown at the start of
the line; the default form for this includes the name of the session being
read.  See below for more information on these parameters.  In this mode,
<B>tcp_read</B> can be called repeatedly until it returns status 2 which
indicates all pending input from all specified sessions has been handled.
<P>

With the option <B>-b</B>, equivalent to an infinite timeout, the function
will block until a line is available to read from one of the specified
sessions.  However, only a single line is returned.
<P>

The option <B>-d</B> indicates that all pending input should be drained.  In
this case <B>tcp_read</B> may process multiple lines in the manner given
above; only the last is stored in <B>$TCP_LINE</B>, but the complete set is
stored in the array <B>$tcp_lines</B>.  This is cleared at the start of each
call to <B>tcp_read</B>.
<P>

The options <B>-t</B> and <B>-T</B> specify a timeout in seconds, which may be a
floating point number for increased accuracy.  With <B>-t</B> the timeout is
applied before each line read.  With <B>-T</B>, the timeout applies to the
overall operation, possibly including multiple read operations if the
option <B>-d</B> is present; without this option, there is no distinction
between <B>-t</B> and <B>-T</B>.
<P>

The function does not print informational messages, but if the option
<B>-q</B> is given, no error message is printed for a non-existent session.
<P>

A return value of 2 indicates a timeout or no data to read.  Any other
non-zero return value indicates some error condition.
<P>

See <B>tcp_log</B> for how to control where data is sent by <B>tcp_read</B>.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>tcp_send [-nq] [ -s</B> <I>sess</I> <B>| -l</B> <I>sess</I><B>,... ]</B> <I>data</I> <B>...</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>tcp_send [-nq] -a</B> <I>data</I> <B>...</B>
Send the supplied data strings to all the specified sessions in turn.  The
underlying operation differs little from a `<B>print -r</B>' to the session's
file descriptor, although it attempts to prevent the shell from dying owing
to a <B>SIGPIPE</B> caused by an attempt to write to a defunct session.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The option <B>-n</B> prevents <B>tcp_send</B> from putting a newline at the end
of the data strings.
<P>

The remaining options all behave as for <B>tcp_read</B>.
<P>

The data arguments are not further processed once they have been passed to
<B>tcp_send</B>; they are simply passed down to <B>print -r</B>.
<P>

If the parameter <B>$TCP_OUTPUT</B> is a non-empty string and logging is
enabled then the data sent to each session will be echoed to the log
file(s) with <B>$TCP_OUTPUT</B> in front where appropriate, much in the manner
of <B>$TCP_PROMPT</B>.

This function is not particularly well tested.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

The first form creates an alias for a session name; <I>alias</I> can then be
used to refer to the existing session <I>sess</I>.  As many aliases may be
listed as required.
<P>

The second form lists any aliases specified, or all aliases if none.
<P>

The third form deletes all the aliases listed.  The underlying sessions are
not affected.
<P>

The option <B>-q</B> suppresses an inconsistently chosen subset of error
messages.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_log [-asc] [ -n | -N ] [</B> <I>logfile</I> <B>]</B><DD>
With an argument <I>logfile</I>, all future input from <B>tcp_read</B> will be
logged to the named file.  Unless <B>-a</B> (append) is given, this file will
first be truncated or created empty.  With no arguments, show the current
status of logging.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With the option <B>-s</B>, per-session logging is enabled.  Input from
<B>tcp_read</B> is output to the file <I>logfile</I>.<I>sess</I>.  As the
session is automatically discriminated by the filename, the contents are
raw (no <B>$TCP_PROMPT</B>).  The option  <B>-a</B> applies as above.
Per-session logging and logging of all data in one file are not mutually
exclusive.
<P>

The option <B>-c</B> closes all logging, both complete and per-session logs.
<P>

The options <B>-n</B> and <B>-N</B> respectively turn off or restore output of
data read by <B>tcp_read</B> to standard output; hence `<B>tcp_log -cn</B>' turns
off all output by <B>tcp_read</B>.
<P>

The function is purely a convenient front end to setting the parameters
<B>$TCP_LOG</B>, <B>$TCP_LOG_SESS</B>, <B>$TCP_SILENT</B>, which are described below.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_rename</B> <I>old</I> <I>new</I><DD>
Rename session <I>old</I> to session <I>new</I>.  The old name becomes invalid.
<DT><B>tcp_sess [</B> <I>sess</I> <B>[</B> <I>command</I>  <B>... ] ]</B><DD>
With no arguments, list all the open sessions and associated file
descriptors.  The current session is marked with a star.  For use in
functions, direct access to the parameters <B>$tcp_by_name</B>, <B>$tcp_by_fd</B>
and <B>$TCP_SESS</B> is probably more convenient; see below.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With a <I>sess</I> argument, set the current session to <I>sess</I>.
This is equivalent to changing <B>$TCP_SESS</B> directly.
<P>

With additional arguments, temporarily set the current session while
executing the string <B>command ...</B>.  The first argument is re-evaluated
so as to expand aliases etc., but the remaining arguments are passed
through as the appear to <B>tcp_sess</B>.  The original session is restored
when <B>tcp_sess</B> exits.

<B>tcp_command</B> <I>send-options</I> <B>...</B> <I>send-arguments</I> <B>...</B>
This is a convenient front-end to <B>tcp_send</B>.  All arguments are passed
to <B>tcp_send</B>, then the function pauses waiting for data.  While data is
arriving at least every <B>$TCP_TIMEOUT</B> (default 0.3) seconds, data is
handled and printed out according to the current settings.  Status 0 is
always returned.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DD>
<B>    [ -a | -s</B> <I>sess</I> <B>... | -l</B> <I>sess</I><B>,... ]</B> <I>pattern</I> ...
Wait for input matching any of the given <I>pattern</I>s from any of the
specified sessions.  Input is ignored until an input line matches one of
the given patterns; at this point status zero is returned, the matching
line is stored in <B>$TCP_LINE</B>, and the full set of lines read during the
call to <B>tcp_expect</B> is stored in the array <B>$tcp_expect_lines</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Sessions are specified in the same way as <B>tcp_read</B>: the default is to
use the current session, otherwise the sessions specified by <B>-a</B>,
<B>-s</B>, or <B>-l</B> are used.
<P>

Each <I>pattern</I> is a standard zsh extended-globbing pattern; note that it
needs to be quoted to avoid it being expanded immediately by filename
generation.  It must match the full line, so to match a substring there
must be a `<B>*</B>' at the start and end.  The line matched against includes
the <B>$TCP_PROMPT</B> added by <B>tcp_read</B>.  It is possible to include the
globbing flags `<B>#b</B>' or `<B>#m</B>' in the patterns to make backreferences
available in the parameters <B>$MATCH</B>, <B>$match</B>, etc., as described in
the base zsh documentation on pattern matching.
<P>

Unlike <B>tcp_read</B>, the default behaviour of <B>tcp_expect</B> is to block
indefinitely until the required input is found.  This can be modified by
specifying a timeout with <B>-t</B> or <B>-T</B>; these function as in
<B>tcp_read</B>, specifying a per-read or overall timeout, respectively, in
seconds, as an integer or floating-point number.  As <B>tcp_read</B>, the
function returns status 2 if a timeout occurs.
<P>

The function returns as soon as any one of the patterns given match.  If
the caller needs to know which of the patterns matched, the option <B>-p</B>
<I>var</I> can be used; on return, <B>$var</B> is set to the number of the
pattern using ordinary zsh indexing, i.e. the first is 1, and so on.  Note
the absence of a `<B>$</B>' in front of <I>var</I>.  To avoid clashes, the
parameter cannot begin with `<B>_expect</B>'.
<P>

The option <B>-q</B> is passed directly down to <B>tcp_read</B>.
<P>

As all input is done via <B>tcp_read</B>, all the usual rules about output of
lines read apply.  One exception is that the parameter <B>$tcp_lines</B> will
only reflect the line actually matched by <B>tcp_expect</B>; use
<B>$tcp_expect_lines</B> for the full set of lines read during the function
call.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_proxy</B><DD>
This is a simple-minded function to accept a TCP connection and execute a
command with I/O redirected to the connection.  Extreme caution should be
taken as there is no security whatsoever and this can leave your computer
open to the world.  Ideally, it should only be used behind a firewall.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The first argument is a TCP port on which the function will listen.
<P>

The remaining arguments give a command and its arguments to execute with
standard input, standard output and standard error redirected to the
file descriptor on which the TCP session has been accepted.
If no command is given, a new zsh is started.  This gives everyone on
your network direct access to your account, which in many cases will be a
bad thing.
<P>

The command is run in the background, so <B>tcp_proxy</B> can then accept new
connections.  It continues to accept new connections until interrupted.

Execute `<I>cmd</I> <B>...</B>' for each session in turn.  Note this executes
the command and arguments; it does not send the command line as data
unless the <B>-t</B> (transmit) option is given.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The sessions may be selected explicitly with the standard <B>-a</B>, <B>-s</B> or
<B>-l</B> options, or may be chosen implicitly.  If none of the three options
is given the rules are: first, if the array <B>$tcp_spam_list</B> is set, this
is taken as the list of sessions, otherwise all sessions are taken.
Second, any sessions given in the array <B>$tcp_no_spam_list</B> are removed
from the list of sessions.
<P>

Normally, any sessions added by the `<B>-a</B>' flag or when all sessions are
chosen implicitly are spammed in alphabetic order; sessions given by the
<B>$tcp_spam_list</B> array or on the command line are spammed in the order
given.  The <B>-r</B> flag reverses the order however it was arrived it.
<P>

The <B>-v</B> flag specifies that a <B>$TCP_PROMPT</B> will be output before each
session.  This is output after any modification to TCP_SESS by the
user-defined <B>tcp_on_spam</B> function described below.  (Obviously that
function is able to generate its own output.)
<P>

If the option <B>-e</B> is present, the line given as <I>cmd ...</I> is executed
using <B>eval</B>, otherwise it is executed without any further processing.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_talk</B><DD>
This is a fairly simple-minded attempt to force input to the line editor to
go straight to the default TCP_SESSION.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

An escape string, <B>$TCP_TALK_ESCAPE</B>, default `:', is used to allow
access to normal shell operation.  If it is on its own at the start of the
line, or followed only by whitespace, the line editor returns to normal
operation.  Otherwise, the string and any following whitespace are skipped
and the remainder of the line executed as shell input without any change of
the line editor's operating mode.
<P>

The current implementation is somewhat deficient in terms of use of the
command history.  For this reason, many users will prefer to use some form
of alternative approach for sending data easily to the current session.
One simple approach is to alias some special character (such as `<B>%</B>') to
`<B>tcp_command --</B>'.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_wait</B><DD>
The sole argument is an integer or floating point number which gives the
seconds to delay.  The shell will do nothing for that period except wait
for input on all TCP sessions by calling <B>tcp_read -a</B>.  This is similar
to the interactive behaviour at the command prompt when zle handlers are
installed.

This pair of functions provide a simple way to transfer a file between

currently done using <B>cat</B>.  <B>tcp_point</B> reads any data arriving at
<I>port</I> and sends it to standard output; <B>tcp_shoot</B> connects to
<I>port</I> on <I>host</I> and sends its standard input.  Any unused <I>port</I>

<H2>TCP USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

Certain functions, if defined by the user, will be called by the function
system in certain contexts.  This facility depends on the module
<B>zsh/parameter</B>, which is usually available in interactive shells as the
completion system depends on it.  None of the functions need be defined;
they simply provide convenient hooks when necessary.
<P>

Typically, these are called after the requested action has been taken, so
that the various parameters will reflect the new state.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>tcp_on_alias</B> <I>alias</I> <I>fd</I>
When an alias is defined, this function will be called with two arguments:
the name of the alias, and the file descriptor of the corresponding session.
<DT><B>tcp_on_close</B> <I>sess</I> <I>fd</I><DD>
This is called with the name of a session being closed and the file
descriptor which corresponded to that session.  Both will be invalid by
the time the function is called.
<DT><B>tcp_on_open</B> <I>sess</I> <I>fd</I><DD>
This is called after a new session has been defined with the session name
and file descriptor as arguments.
<DT><B>tcp_on_rename</B> <I>oldsess</I> <I>fd</I> <I>newsess</I><DD>
This is called after a session has been renamed with the three arguments
old session name, file descriptor, new session name.
<DT><B>tcp_on_spam</B> <I>sess</I> <I>command</I> <B>...</B><DD>
This is called once for each session spammed, just <I>before</I> a command is
executed for a session by <B>tcp_spam</B>.  The arguments are the session name
followed by the command list to be executed.  If <B>tcp_spam</B> was called
with the option <B>-t</B>, the first command will be <B>tcp_send</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This function is called after <B>$TCP_SESS</B> is set to reflect the session
to be spammed, but before any use of it is made.  Hence it is possible to
alter the value of <B>$TCP_SESS</B> within this function.  For example, the
session arguments to <B>tcp_spam</B> could include extra information to be
stripped off and processed in <B>tcp_on_spam</B>.
<P>

If the function sets the parameter <B>$REPLY</B> to `<B>done</B>', the command
line is not executed; in addition, no prompt is printed for the <B>-v</B>
option to <B>tcp_spam</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_on_unalias</B> <I>alias</I> <I>fd</I><DD>

file descriptor after an alias has been deleted.

<H2>TCP UTILITY FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

The following functions are used by the TCP function system but will rarely
if ever need to be called directly.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>tcp_fd_handler</B>
This is the function installed by <B>tcp_open</B> for handling input from
within the line editor, if that is required.  It is in the format
documented for the builtin `<B>zle -F</B>' in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1)
.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

While active, the function sets the parameter <B>TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE</B> to 1.
This allows shell code called internally (for example, by setting
<B>tcp_on_read</B>) to tell if is being called when the shell is otherwise
idle at the editor prompt.
</DL>

<DT><B>tcp_output [ -q ] -P</B> <I>prompt</I> <B>-F</B> <I>fd</I> <B>-S</B> <I>sess</I><DD>
This function is used for both logging and handling output to standard
output, from within <B>tcp_read</B> and (if <B>$TCP_OUTPUT</B> is set)
<B>tcp_send</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <I>prompt</I> to use is specified by <B>-P</B>; the default is the empty
string.  It can contain:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%c</B>
Expands to 1 if the session is the current session, otherwise 0.  Used
with ternary expresions such as `<B>%(c.-.+)</B>' to
output `<B>+</B>' for the current session and `<B>-</B>' otherwise.
<DT><B>%f</B><DD>
Replaced by the session's file descriptor.
<DT><B>%s</B><DD>
Replaced by the session name.
<DT><B>%%</B><DD>
Replaced by a single `<B>%</B>'.
</DL>
<P>

The option <B>-q</B> suppresses output to standard output, but not to any log
files which are configured.
<P>

The <B>-S</B> and <B>-F</B> options are used to pass in the session name and file
descriptor for possible replacement in the prompt.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbHG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TCP USER PARAMETERS</H2>

<P>

Parameters follow the usual convention that uppercase is used for scalars
and integers, while lowercase is used for normal and associative array.
It is always safe for user code to read these parameters.  Some parameters
may also be set; these are noted explicitly.  Others are included in this
group as they are set by the function system for the user's benefit,
i.e. setting them is typically not useful but is benign.
<P>

It is often also useful to make settable parameters local to a function.
For example, `<B>local TCP_SILENT=1</B>' specifies that data read during the
function call will not be printed to standard output, regardless of the
setting outside the function.  Likewise, `<B>local TCP_SESS=</B><I>sess</I>'
sets a session for the duration of a function, and `<B>local
TCP_PROMPT=</B>' specifies that no prompt is used for input during the
function.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>tcp_expect_lines</B>
Array.  The set of lines read during the last call to <B>tcp_expect</B>,
including the last (<B>$TCP_LINE</B>).
<DT><B>tcp_filter</B><DD>
Array. May be set directly.  A set of extended globbing patterns which,
if matched in <B>tcp_output</B>, will cause the line not to be printed to
standard output.  The patterns should be defined as described for the
arguments to <B>tcp_expect</B>.  Output of line to log files is not affected.
<DT><B>TCP_HANDLER_ACTIVE</B><DD>
Scalar.  Set to 1 within <B>tcp_fd_handler</B> to indicate to functions
called recursively that they have been called during an editor session.
Otherwise unset.
<DT><B>TCP_LINE</B><DD>
The last line read by <B>tcp_read</B>, and hence also <B>tcp_expect</B>.
<DT><B>TCP_LINE_FD</B><DD>
The file descriptor from which <B>$TCP_LINE</B> was read.
<B>${tcp_by_fd[$TCP_LINE_FD]}</B> will give the corresponding session name.
<DT><B>tcp_lines</B><DD>
Array. The set of lines read during the last call to <B>tcp_read</B>,
including the last (<B>$TCP_LINE</B>).
<DT><B>TCP_LOG</B><DD>
May be set directly, although it is also controlled by <B>tcp_log</B>.
The name of a file to which output from all sessions will be sent.
The output is proceeded by the usual <B>$TCP_PROMPT</B>.  If it is not an
absolute path name, it will follow the user's current directory.
<DT><B>TCP_LOG_SESS</B><DD>
May be set directly, although it is also controlled by <B>tcp_log</B>.
The prefix for a set of files to which output from each session separately
will be sent; the full filename is <B>${TCP_LOG_SESS}.</B><I>sess</I>.
Output to each file is raw; no prompt is added.  If it is not an absolute
path name, it will follow the user's current directory.
<DT><B>tcp_no_spam_list</B><DD>
Array.  May be set directly.  See <B>tcp_spam</B> for how this is used.
<DT><B>TCP_OUTPUT</B><DD>
May be set directly.  If a non-empty string, any data sent to a session by
<B>tcp_send</B> will be logged.  This parameter gives the prompt to be used
in a file specified by <B>$TCP_LOG</B> but not in a file generated from
<B>$TCP_LOG_SESS</B>.  The prompt string has the same format as
<B>TCP_PROMPT</B> and the same rules for its use apply.
<DT><B>TCP_PROMPT</B><DD>
May be set directly.  Used as the prefix for data read by <B>tcp_read</B>
which is printed to standard output or to the log file given by
<B>$TCP_LOG</B>, if any.  Any `<B>%s</B>', `<B>%f</B>' or `<B>%%</B>' occurring in the
string will be replaced by the name of the session, the session's
underlying file descriptor, or a single `<B>%</B>', respectively.  The
expression `<B>%c</B>' expands to 1 if the session being read is the current
session, else 0; this is most useful in ternary expressions such as
`<B>%(c.-.+)</B>' which outputs `<B>+</B>' if the session is
the current one, else `<B>-</B>'.
<DT><B>TCP_READ_DEBUG</B><DD>
May be set directly.  If this has non-zero length, <B>tcp_read</B> will give
some limited diagnostics about data being read.
<DT><B>TCP_SECONDS_START</B><DD>
This value is created and initialised to zero by tcp_open.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The functions <B>tcp_read</B> and <B>tcp_expect</B> use the shell's
<B>SECONDS</B> parameter for their own timing purposes.  If that parameter
is not of floating point type on entry to one of the functions, it will
create a local parameter <B>SECONDS</B> which is floating point and set the
parameter <B>TCP_SECONDS_START</B> to the previous value of <B>$SECONDS</B>.
If the parameter is already floating point, it is used without a local
copy being created and <B>TCP_SECONDS_START</B> is not set.  As the global
value is zero, the shell elapsed time is guaranteed to be the sum of
<B>$SECONDS</B> and <B>$TCP_SECONDS_START</B>.
<P>

This can be avoided by setting <B>SECONDS</B> globally to a floating point
value using `<B>typeset -F SECONDS</B>'; then the TCP functions will never
make a local copy and never set <B>TCP_SECONDS_START</B> to a non-zero value.
</DL>

<DT><B>TCP_SESS</B><DD>
May be set directly.  The current session; must refer to one of the
sessions established by <B>tcp_open</B>.
<DT><B>TCP_SILENT</B><DD>
May be set directly, although it is also controlled by <B>tcp_log</B>.
If of non-zero length, data read by <B>tcp_read</B> will not be written to
standard output, though may still be written to a log file.
<DT><B>tcp_spam_list</B><DD>
Array.  May be set directly.  See the description of the function
<B>tcp_spam</B> for how this is used.
<DT><B>TCP_TALK_ESCAPE</B><DD>
May be set directly.  See the description of the function <B>tcp_talk</B> for
how this is used.
<DT><B>TCP_TIMEOUT</B><DD>
May be set directly.  Currently this is only used by the function
<B>tcp_command</B>, see above.

<H2>TCP USER-DEFINED PARAMETERS</H2>

<P>

The following parameters are not set by the function system, but have
a special effect if set by the user.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>tcp_on_read</B>
This should be an associative array; if it is not, the behaviour is
undefined.  Each key is the name of a shell function or other command,
and the corresponding value is a shell pattern (using <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B>).
Every line read from a TCP session directly or indirectly using
<B>tcp_read</B> (which includes lines read by <B>tcp_expect</B>) is compared
against the pattern.  If the line matches, the command given in the key is
called with two arguments: the name of the session from which the line was
read, and the line itself.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If any function called to handle a line returns a non-zero status, the
line is not output.  Thus a <B>tcp_on_read</B> handler containing only
the instruction `<B>return 1</B>' can be used to suppress output of
particular lines (see, however, <B>tcp_filter</B> above).  However, the line
is still stored in <B>TCP_LINE</B> and <B>tcp_lines</B>; this occurs after all
<B>tcp_on_read</B> processing.

<DT><B>tcp_by_fd</B><DD>
Associative array.  The keys are session file descriptors; each

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>tcp_open localhost 7337 dc</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

To send a command to the remote session and wait a short while for output
(assuming <B>dc</B> is the current session):
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>tcp_command 2 4 + p</B>

<P>

To close the session:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>tcp_close</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <B>tcp_proxy</B> needs to be killed to be stopped.  Note this will not
usually kill any connections which have already been accepted, and also
that the port is not immediately available for reuse.

<H2>TCP BUGS</H2>

<P>

The function <B>tcp_read</B> uses the shell's normal <B>read</B> builtin.  As
this reads a complete line at once, data arriving without a terminating
newline can cause the function to block indefinitely.
<P>

Though the function suite works well for interactive use and for data
arriving in small amounts, the performance when large amounts of data are
being exchanged is likely to be extremely poor.


<A NAME="lbHL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

zshzftpsys - zftp function front-end

<A NAME="lbHM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source
distribution as an interface to the <B>zftp</B> builtin command, allowing you
to perform FTP operations from the shell command line or within functions
or scripts.  The interface is similar to a traditional FTP client (e.g. the
<B>ftp</B> command itself, see <I><A HREF="../man1/ftp.1.php">ftp</A></I>(1)), but as it is entirely done
within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and globbing features,
and so on, are present, and macros are particularly simple to write as they
are just ordinary shell functions.
<P>

The prerequisite is that the <B>zftp</B> command, as described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)
, must be available in the
version of <B>zsh</B> installed at your site.  If the shell is configured to
load new commands at run time, it probably is: typing `<B>zmodload zsh/zftp</B>'
will make sure (if that runs silently, it has worked).  If this is not the
case, it is possible <B>zftp</B> was linked into the shell anyway: to test
this, type `<B>which zftp</B>' and if <B>zftp</B> is available you will get the
message `<B>zftp: shell built-in command</B>'.
<P>

Commands given directly with <B>zftp</B> builtin may be interspersed between
the functions in this suite; in a few cases, using <B>zftp</B> directly may
cause some of the status information stored in shell parameters to become
invalid.  Note in particular the description of the variables
<B>$ZFTP_TMOUT</B>, <B>$ZFTP_PREFS</B> and <B>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</B> for <B>zftp</B>.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME="lbHN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INSTALLATION</H2>

<P>

You should make sure all the functions from the <B>Functions/Zftp</B>
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with the
two letters `<B>zf</B>'.  They may already have been installed on your system;
otherwise, you will need to find them and copy them.  The directory should
appear as one of the elements of the <B>$fpath</B> array (this should already
be the case if they were installed), and at least the function <B>zfinit</B>
should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest.  Finally, to initialize
the use of the system you need to call the <B>zfinit</B> function.  The
following code in your <B>.zshrc</B> will arrange for this; assume the
functions are stored in the directory <B>~/myfns</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)
autoload -U zfinit
zfinit</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Note that <B>zfinit</B> assumes you are using the <B>zmodload</B> method to
load the <B>zftp</B> command.  If it is already built into the shell, change
<B>zfinit</B> to <B>zfinit -n</B>.  It is helpful (though not essential) if the
call to <B>zfinit</B> appears after any code to initialize the new completion
system, else unnecessary <B>compctl</B> commands will be given.
<P>

<A NAME="lbHO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is essentially the
same as that in a standard FTP client.  Note that, due to a quirk of the
shell's <B>getopts</B> builtin, for those functions that handle options you
must use `<B>-</B><B>-</B>' rather than `<B>-</B>' to ensure the remaining arguments
are treated literally (a single `<B>-</B>' is treated as an argument).

<B>zfparams [ </B><I>host</I> [ <I>user</I> [ <I>password</I> ... ] ] ]
Set or show the parameters for a future <B>zfopen</B> with no arguments.  If
no arguments are given, the current parameters are displayed (the password
will be shown as a line of asterisks).  If a host is given, and either the
<I>user</I> or <I>password</I> is not, they will be prompted for; also, any
parameter given as `<B>?</B>' will be prompted for, and if the `<B>?</B>' is
followed by a string, that will be used as the prompt.  As <B>zfopen</B> calls
<B>zfparams</B> to store the parameters, this usually need not be called
directly.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

A single argument `<B>-</B>' will delete the stored parameters.  This will
also cause the memory of the last directory (and so on) on the other host
to be deleted.
</DL>

<DT><B>zfopen [ -1 ] [ </B><I>host</I> [ <I>user</I> [ <I>password</I> [ <I>account</I> ] ] ] ]<DD>
If <I>host</I> is present, open a connection to that host under username
<I>user</I> with password <I>password</I> (and, on the rare occasions when it
is necessary, account <I>account</I>).  If a necessary parameter is missing or
given as `<B>?</B>' it will be prompted for.  If <I>host</I> is not present, use
a previously stored set of parameters.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the command was successful, and the terminal is compatible with
<B>xterm</B> or is <B>sun-cmd</B>, a summary will appear in the title bar,
giving the local <B>host:directory</B> and the remote <B>host:directory</B>;
this is handled by the function <B>zftp_chpwd</B>, described below.
<P>

Normally, the <I>host</I>, <I>user</I> and <I>password</I> are internally
recorded for later re-opening, either by a <B>zfopen</B> with no arguments, or
automatically (see below).  With the option `<B>-1</B>', no information is
stored.  Also, if an open command with arguments failed, the parameters
will not be retained (and any previous parameters will also be deleted).
A <B>zfopen</B> on its own, or a <B>zfopen -1</B>, never alters the stored
parameters.
<P>

Both <B>zfopen</B> and <B>zfanon</B> (but not <B>zfparams</B>) understand URLs of
the form <B>ftp://</B><I>host</I>/<I>path...</I> as meaning to connect to the
<I>host</I>, then change directory to <I>path</I> (which must be a directory,
not a file).  The `<B>ftp://</B>' can be omitted; the trailing `<B>/</B>' is enough
to trigger recognition of the <I>path</I>.  Note prefixes other than
`<B>ftp:</B>' are not recognized, and that all characters after the first
slash beyond <I>host</I> are significant in <I>path</I>.
</DL>

<DT><B>zfanon [ -1 ] </B><I>host</I><DD>
Open a connection <I>host</I> for anonymous FTP.  The username used is
`<B>anonymous</B>'.  The password (which will be reported the first time) is
generated as <I>user</I><B>@</B><I>host</I>; this is then stored in the shell
parameter <B>$EMAIL_ADDR</B> which can alternatively be set manually to a
suitable string.

<P>

The third form attempts to change the current directory by replacing the
first occurrence of the string <I>old</I> with the string <I>new</I> in the
current directory.
<P>

Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename is
expected, the string which on the local host corresponds to `<B>~</B>' is
converted back to a `<B>~</B>' before being passed to the remote machine.
This is convenient because of the way expansion is performed on the command
line before <B>zfcd</B> receives a string.  For example, suppose the command
is `<B>zfcd ~/foo</B>'.  The shell will expand this to a full path such as
`<B>zfcd /home/user2/pws/foo</B>'.  At this stage, <B>zfcd</B> recognises the
initial path as corresponding to `<B>~</B>' and will send the directory to
the remote host as <B>~/foo</B>, so that the `<B>~</B>' will be expanded by the
server to the correct remote host directory.  Other named directories of
the form `<B>~name</B>' are not treated in this fashion.
</DL>

<DT><B>zfhere</B><DD>
Change directory on the remote server to the one corresponding to the
current local directory, with special handling of `<B>~</B>' as in <B>zfcd</B>.
For example, if the current local directory is <B>~/foo/bar</B>, then
<B>zfhere</B> performs the effect of `<B>zfcd ~/foo/bar</B>'.
<DT><B>zfdir [ -rfd ] [ - ] [ </B><I>dir-options</I> ] [ <I>dir</I> ]<DD>
Produce a long directory listing.  The arguments <I>dir-options</I> and
<I>dir</I> are passed directly to the server and their effect is
implementation dependent, but specifying a particular remote directory
<I>dir</I> is usually possible.  The output is passed through a pager
given by the environment variable <B>$PAGER</B>, or `<B>more</B>' if that is not
set.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The directory is usually cached for re-use.  In fact, two caches are
maintained.  One is for use when there is no <I>dir-options</I> or <I>dir</I>,
i.e. a full listing of the current remote directory; it is flushed
when the current remote directory changes.  The other is
kept for repeated use of <B>zfdir</B> with the same arguments; for example,
repeated use of `<B>zfdir /pub/gnu</B>' will only require the directory to be
retrieved on the first call.  Alternatively, this cache can be re-viewed with
the <B>-r</B> option.  As relative directories will confuse
<B>zfdir</B>, the <B>-f</B> option can be used to force the cache to be flushed
before the directory is listed.  The option <B>-d</B> will delete both
caches without showing a directory listing; it will also delete the cache
of file names in the current remote directory, if any.
</DL>

<DT><B>zfls</B> [ <I>ls-options</I> ] [ <I>dir</I> ]<DD>
List files on the remote server.  With no arguments, this will produce a
simple list of file names for the current remote directory.  Any arguments
are passed directly to the server.  No pager and no caching is used.

<H3>Status commands</H3>


<DL COMPACT>

<B>zftype</B> [ <I>type</I> ]
With no arguments, show the type of data to be transferred, usually ASCII
or binary.  With an argument, change the type: the types `<B>A</B>' or
`<B>ASCII</B>' for ASCII data and `<B>B</B>' or `<B>BINARY</B>', `<B>I</B>' or
`<B>IMAGE</B>' for binary data are understood case-insensitively.
<DT><B>zfstat</B> [ -v ]<DD>
Show the status of the current or last connection, as well as the status of
some of <B>zftp</B>'s status variables.  With the <B>-v</B> option, a more
verbose listing is produced by querying the server for its version of
events, too.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbHS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Retrieving files</H3>

The commands for retrieving files all take at least two options. <B>-G</B>
suppresses remote filename expansion which would otherwise be performed
(see below for a more detailed description of that).  <B>-t</B> attempts
to set the modification time of the local file to that of the remote file:
this requires version 5 of <B>perl</B>, see the description of the function
<B>zfrtime</B> below for more information.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zfget [ -Gtc ] </B><I>file1</I> ...
Retrieve all the listed files <I>file1</I> ... one at a time from the remote
server.  If a file contains a `<B>/</B>', the full name is passed to the
remote server, but the file is stored locally under the name given by the
part after the final `<B>/</B>'.  The option <B>-c</B> (cat) forces all files to
be sent as a single stream to standard output; in this case the <B>-t</B>
option has no effect.
<DT><B>zfuget [ -Gvst ] </B><I>file1</I> ...<DD>
As <B>zfget</B>, but only retrieve files where the version on the remote
server is newer (has a later modification time), or where the local file
does not exist.  If the remote file is older but the files have different
sizes, or if the sizes are the same but the remote file is newer, the user
will usually be queried.  With the option <B>-s</B>, the command runs silently
and will always retrieve the file in either of those two cases.  With the
option <B>-v</B>, the command prints more information about the files while it
is working out whether or not to transfer them.
<DT><B>zfcget [ -Gt ] </B><I>file1</I> ...<DD>
As <B>zfget</B>, but if any of the local files exists, and is shorter than
the corresponding remote file, the command assumes that it is the result of
a partially completed transfer and attempts to transfer the rest of the
file.  This is useful on a poor connection which keeps failing.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Note that this requires a commonly implemented, but non-standard, version
of the FTP protocol, so is not guaranteed to work on all servers.

<DT>

<B>zfgcp [ -Gt ] </B><I>rfile1</I> ... <I>ldir</I>
This retrieves files from the remote server with arguments behaving
similarly to the <B>cp</B> command.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

In the first form, copy <I>remote-file</I> from the server to the local file
<I>local-file</I>.
<P>

In the second form, copy all the remote files <I>rfile1</I> ... into the
local directory <I>ldir</I> retaining the same basenames.  This assumes UNIX
directory semantics.

<H3>Sending files</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zfput [ -r ] </B><I>file1</I> ...
Send all the <I>file1</I> ... given separately to the remote server.  If a
filename contains a `<B>/</B>', the full filename is used locally to find the
file, but only the basename is used for the remote file name.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With the option <B>-r</B>, if any of the <I>files</I> are directories they are
sent recursively with all their subdirectories, including files beginning
with `<B>.</B>'.  This requires that the remote machine understand UNIX file
semantics, since `<B>/</B>' is used as a directory separator.
</DL>

<DT><B>zfuput [ -vs ] </B><I>file1</I> ...<DD>
As <B>zfput</B>, but only send files which are newer than their local
equivalents, or if the remote file does not exist.  The logic is the same
as for <B>zfuget</B>, but reversed between local and remote files.
<DT><B>zfcput </B><I>file1</I> ...<DD>
As <B>zfput</B>, but if any remote file already exists and is shorter than the
local equivalent, assume it is the result of an incomplete transfer and
send the rest of the file to append to the existing part.  As the FTP
append command is part of the standard set, this is in principle more
likely to work than <B>zfcget</B>.
<DT>

<B>zfpcp </B><I>local-file</I> <I>remote-file</I>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zfpcp </B><I>lfile1</I> ... <I>rdir</I>
This sends files to the remote server with arguments behaving similarly to
the <B>cp</B> command.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With two arguments, copy <I>local-file</I> to the server as
<I>remote-file</I>.
<P>

With more than two arguments, copy all the local files <I>lfile1</I> ... into
the existing remote directory <I>rdir</I> retaining the same basenames.  This
assumes UNIX directory semantics.
<P>

A problem arises if you attempt to use <B>zfpcp</B> <I>lfile1</I> <I>rdir</I>,
i.e. the second form of copying but with two arguments, as the command has
no simple way of knowing if <I>rdir</I> corresponds to a directory or a
filename.  It attempts to resolve this in various ways.  First, if the
<I>rdir</I> argument is `<B>.</B>' or `<B>..</B>' or ends in a slash, it is assumed
to be a directory.  Secondly, if the operation of copying to a remote file
in the first form failed, and the remote server sends back the expected
failure code 553 and a reply including the string `<B>Is a directory</B>',
then <B>zfpcp</B> will retry using the second form.

<H3>Session management</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zfsession</B> [ <B>-lvod</B> ] [ <I>sessname</I> ]
Allows you to manage multiple FTP sessions at once.  By default,
connections take place in a session called `<B>default</B>'; by giving the
command `<B>zfsession</B> <I>sessname</I>' you can change to a new or existing
session with a name of your choice.  The new session remembers its own
connection, as well as associated shell parameters, and also the host/user
parameters set by <B>zfparams</B>.  Hence you can have different sessions set
up to connect to different hosts, each remembering the appropriate host,
user and password.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With no arguments, <B>zfsession</B> prints the name of the current session;
with the option <B>-l</B> it lists all sessions which currently exist, and
with the option <B>-v</B> it gives a verbose list showing the host and
directory for each session, where the current session is marked with an
asterisk.  With <B>-o</B>, it will switch to the most recent previous session.
<P>

With <B>-d</B>, the given session (or else the current one) is removed;
everything to do with it is completely forgotten.  If it was the only
session, a new session called `<B>default</B>' is created and made current.
It is safest not to delete sessions while background commands using
<B>zftp</B> are active.
</DL>

<DT><B>zftransfer</B> <I>sess1</I><B>:</B><I>file1</I> <I>sess2</I><B>:</B><I>file2</I><DD>
Transfer files between two sessions; no local copy is made.  The file
is read from the session <I>sess1</I> as <I>file1</I> and written to session
<I>sess2</I> as file <I>file2</I>; <I>file1</I> and <I>file2</I> may be relative to
the current directories of the session.  Either <I>sess1</I> or <I>sess2</I>
may be omitted (though the colon should be retained if there is a
possibility of a colon appearing in the file name) and defaults to the
current session; <I>file2</I> may be omitted or may end with a slash, in
which case the basename of <I>file1</I> will be added.  The sessions
<I>sess1</I> and <I>sess2</I> must be distinct.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The operation is performed using pipes, so it is required that the
connections still be valid in a subshell, which is not the case under 
versions of some operating systems, presumably due to a system bug.

<H3>Bookmarks</H3>

The two functions <B>zfmark</B> and <B>zfgoto</B> allow you to `bookmark' the
present location (host, user and directory) of the current FTP connection
for later use.  The file to be used for storing and retrieving bookmarks is
given by the parameter <B>$ZFTP_BMFILE</B>; if not set when one of the two
functions is called, it will be set to the file <B>.zfbkmarks</B> in the
directory where your zsh startup files live (usually <B>~</B>).
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zfmark [ </B><I>bookmark</I><B> ]</B>
If given an argument, mark the current host, user and directory under the
name <I>bookmark</I> for later use by <B>zfgoto</B>.  If there is no connection
open, use the values for the last connection immediately before it was
closed; it is an error if there was none.  Any existing bookmark
under the same name will be silently replaced.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If not given an argument, list the existing bookmarks and the points to
which they refer in the form <I>user</I><B>@</B><I>host</I><B>:</B><I>directory</I>;
this is the format in which they are stored, and the file may be edited
directly.
</DL>

<DT><B>zfgoto [ -n ] </B><I>bookmark</I><DD>
Return to the location given by <I>bookmark</I>, as previously set by
<B>zfmark</B>.  If the location has user `<B>ftp</B>' or `<B>anonymous</B>', open
the connection with <B>zfanon</B>, so that no password is required.  If the
user and host parameters match those stored for the current session, if
any, those will be used, and again no password is required.  Otherwise a
password will be prompted for.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With the option <B>-n</B>, the bookmark is taken to be a nickname stored by
the <B>ncftp</B> program in its bookmark file, which is assumed to be
<B>~/.ncftp/bookmarks</B>.  The function works identically in other ways.
Note that there is no mechanism for adding or modifying <B>ncftp</B> bookmarks
from the zftp functions.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbHX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Other functions</H3>

Mostly, these functions will not be called directly (apart from
<B>zfinit</B>), but are described here for completeness.  You may wish to
alter <B>zftp_chpwd</B> and <B>zftp_progress</B>, in particular.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zfinit [ -n ]</B>
As described above, this is used to initialize the zftp function system.
The <B>-n</B> option should be used if the zftp command is already built into
the shell.
<DT><B>zfautocheck [ -dn ]</B><DD>
This function is called to implement automatic reopening behaviour, as
described in more detail below.  The options must appear in the first
argument; <B>-n</B> prevents the command from changing to the old directory,
while <B>-d</B> prevents it from setting the variable <B>do_close</B>, which it
otherwise does as a flag for automatically closing the connection after a
transfer.  The host and directory for the last session are stored in the
variable <B>$zflastsession</B>, but the internal host/user/password parameters
must also be correctly set.
<DT><B>zfcd_match </B><I>prefix</I> <I>suffix</I><DD>
This performs matching for completion of remote directory names.  If the
remote server is UNIX, it will attempt to persuade the server to list the
remote directory with subdirectories marked, which usually works but is not
guaranteed.  On other hosts it simply calls <B>zfget_match</B> and hence
completes all files, not just directories.  On some systems, directories
may not even look like filenames.
<DT><B>zfget_match </B><I>prefix</I> <I>suffix</I><DD>
This performs matching for completion of remote filenames.  It caches files
for the current directory (only) in the shell parameter <B>$zftp_fcache</B>.
It is in the form to be called by the <B>-K</B> option of <B>compctl</B>, but
also works when called from a widget-style completion function with
<I>prefix</I> and <I>suffix</I> set appropriately.
<DT><B>zfrglob </B><I>varname</I><DD>
Perform remote globbing, as describes in more detail below.  <I>varname</I>
is the name of a variable containing the pattern to be expanded; if there
were any matches, the same variable will be set to the expanded set of
filenames on return.
<DT><B>zfrtime </B><I>lfile</I> <I>rfile</I> [ <I>time</I> ]<DD>
Set the local file <I>lfile</I> to have the same modification time as the
remote file <I>rfile</I>, or the explicit time <I>time</I> in FTP format
<B>CCYYMMDDhhmmSS</B> for the GMT timezone.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Currently this requires <B>perl</B> version 5 to perform the conversion from
GMT to local time.  This is unfortunately difficult to do using shell code
alone.
</DL>

<DT><B>zftp_chpwd</B><DD>
This function is called every time a connection is opened, or closed, or
the remote directory changes.  This version alters the title bar of an
<B>xterm</B>-compatible or <B>sun-cmd</B> terminal emulator to reflect the 
local and remote hostnames and current directories.  It works best when
combined with the function <B>chpwd</B>.  In particular, a function of 
the form
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>chpwd() {
  if [[ -n $ZFTP_USER ]]; then
    zftp_chpwd
  else
    # usual chpwd e.g put host:directory in title bar
  fi
}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

fits in well.
</DL>

<DT><B>zftp_progress</B><DD>
This function shows the status of the transfer.  It will not write anything
unless the output is going to a terminal; however, if you transfer files in
the background, you should turn off progress reports by hand using
`<B>zstyle ':zftp:*' progress none</B>'.  Note also that if you alter it, any
output <I>must</I> be to standard error, as standard output may be a file
being received.  The form of the progress meter, or whether it is used at
all, can be configured without altering the function, as described in the
next section.
<DT><B>zffcache</B><DD>
This is used to implement caching of files in the current directory for
each session separately.  It is used by <B>zfget_match</B> and <B>zfrglob</B>.
</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbHY">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES</H2>

<P>

<A NAME="lbHZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Configuration</H3>

<P>

Various styles are available using the standard shell style mechanism,
described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1). Briefly, the
command `<B>zstyle ':zftp:*'</B> <I>style</I> <I>value</I> ...'.
defines the <I>style</I> to have value <I>value</I>; more than one value may be
given, although that is not useful in the cases described here.  These
values will then be used throughout the zftp function system.  For more
precise control, the first argument, which gives a context in which the
style applies, can be modified to include a particular function, as for
example `<B>:zftp:zfget</B>': the style will then have the given value only
in the <B>zfget</B> function.  Values for the same style in different contexts
may be set; the most specific function will be used, where
strings are held to be more specific than patterns, and longer patterns and
shorter patterns.  Note that only the top level function name, as called by
the user, is used; calling of lower level functions is transparent to the
user.  Hence modifications to the title bar in <B>zftp_chpwd</B> use the
contexts <B>:zftp:zfopen</B>, <B>:zftp:zfcd</B>, etc., depending where it was
called from.  The following styles are understood:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>progress</B>
Controls the way that <B>zftp_progress</B> reports on the progress of a
transfer.  If empty, unset, or `<B>none</B>', no progress report is made; if
`<B>bar</B>' a growing bar of inverse video is shown; if `<B>percent</B>' (or any
other string, though this may change in future), the percentage of the file
transferred is shown.  The bar meter requires that the width of the
terminal be available via the <B>$COLUMNS</B> parameter (normally this is set
automatically).  If the size of the file being transferred is not
available, <B>bar</B> and <B>percent</B> meters will simply show the number of
bytes transferred so far.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When <B>zfinit</B> is run, if this style is not defined for the context
<B>:zftp:*</B>, it will be set to `bar'.
</DL>

<DT><B>update</B><DD>
Specifies the minimum time interval between updates of the progress meter
in seconds.  No update is made unless new data has been received, so the
actual time interval is limited only by <B>$ZFTP_TIMEOUT</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

As described for <B>progress</B>, <B>zfinit</B> will force this to default to 1.
</DL>

<DT><B>remote-glob</B><DD>
If set to `1', `yes' or `true', filename generation (globbing) is
performed on the remote machine instead of by zsh itself; see below.
<DT><B>titlebar</B><DD>
If set to `1', `yes' or `true', <B>zftp_chpwd</B> will put the remote host and
remote directory into the titlebar of terminal emulators such as xterm or
sun-cmd that allow this.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

As described for <B>progress</B>, <B>zfinit</B> will force this to default to 1.
</DL>

<DT><B>chpwd</B><DD>
If set to `1' `yes' or `true', <B>zftp_chpwd</B> will call the function
<B>chpwd</B> when a connection is closed.  This is useful if the remote host
details were put into the terminal title bar by <B>zftp_chpwd</B> and your
usual <B>chpwd</B> also modifies the title bar.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When <B>zfinit</B> is run, it will determine whether <B>chpwd</B> exists and if
so it will set the default value for the style to 1 if none exists
already.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

Note that there is also an associative array <B>zfconfig</B> which contains
values used by the function system.  This should not be modified or
overwritten.
<P>

<A NAME="lbIA">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Remote globbing</H3>

<P>

The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename generation
(globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing the option
<B>-G</B> to each of the commands.  Normally this operates by retrieving a
complete list of files for the directory in question, then matching these
locally against the pattern supplied.  This has the advantage that the full
range of zsh patterns (respecting the setting of the option
<B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B>) can be used.  However, it means that the directory part
of a filename will not be expanded and must be given exactly.  If the
remote server does not support the UNIX directory semantics, directory
handling is problematic and it is recommended that globbing only be used
within the current directory.  The list of files in the current directory,
if retrieved, will be cached, so that subsequent globs in the same
directory without an intervening <B>zfcd</B> are much faster.
<P>

If the <B>remote-glob</B> style (see above) is set, globbing is instead
performed on the remote host: the server is asked for a list of matching
files.  This is highly dependent on how the server is implemented, though
typically UNIX servers will provide support for basic glob patterns.  This
may in some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire list of
directory contents.
<P>

<A NAME="lbIB">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Automatic and temporary reopening</H3>

<P>

As described for the <B>zfopen</B> command, a subsequent <B>zfopen</B> with no
parameters will reopen the connection to the last host (this includes
connections made with the <B>zfanon</B> command).  Opened in this fashion, the
connection starts in the default remote directory and will remain open
until explicitly closed.
<P>

Automatic re-opening is also available.  If a connection is not currently
open and a command requiring a connection is given, the last connection is
implicitly reopened.  In this case the directory which was current when the
connection was closed again becomes the current directory (unless, of
course, the command given changes it).  Automatic reopening will also take
place if the connection was close by the remote server for whatever reason
(e.g. a timeout).  It is not available if the <B>-1</B> option to <B>zfopen</B>
or <B>zfanon</B> was used.
<P>

Furthermore, if the command issued is a file transfer, the connection will
be closed after the transfer is finished, hence providing a one-shot mode
for transfers.  This does not apply to directory changing or listing
commands; for example a <B>zfdir</B> may reopen a connection but will leave it
open.  Also, automatic closure will only ever happen in the same command as
automatic opening, i.e a <B>zfdir</B> directly followed by a <B>zfget</B> will
never close the connection automatically.
<P>

Information about the previous connection is given by the <B>zfstat</B>
function.  So, for example, if that reports:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>Session:        default
Not connected.
Last session:   <A HREF="ftp://ftp.bar.com">ftp.bar.com</A>:/pub/textfiles</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

then the command <B>zfget file.txt</B> will attempt to reopen a connection to
<B><A HREF="ftp://ftp.bar.com">ftp.bar.com</A></B>, retrieve the file <B>/pub/textfiles/file.txt</B>, and
immediately close the connection again.  On the other hand, <B>zfcd ..</B>
will open the connection in the directory <B>/pub</B> and leave it open.
<P>

Note that all the above is local to each session; if you return to a
previous session, the connection for that session is the one which will be
reopened.
<P>

<A NAME="lbIC">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Completion</H3>

<P>

Completion of local and remote files, directories, sessions and bookmarks
is supported.  The older, <B>compctl</B>-style completion is defined when
<B>zfinit</B> is called; support for the new widget-based completion system is
provided in the function <B>Completion/Zsh/Command/_zftp</B>, which should be
installed with the other functions of the completion system and hence
should automatically be available.

user community.  These are not inherently a part of the shell, and some
may not be available in every zsh installation.  The most significant of
these are documented here.  For documentation on other contributed items
such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files.

<H3>Accessing On-Line Help</H3>

<P>

The key sequence <B>ESC h</B> is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
<B>run-help</B> widget (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1)).  This invokes the <B>run-help</B> command with the command word from the
current input line as its argument.  By default, <B>run-help</B> is an alias
for the <B>man</B> command, so this often fails when the command word is a
shell builtin or a user-defined function.  By redefining the <B>run-help</B>
alias, one can improve the on-line help provided by the shell.
<P>

The <B>helpfiles</B> utility, found in the <B>Util</B> directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual
to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other
shell features as well.  The autoloadable <B>run-help</B> function, found in
<B>Functions/Misc</B>, searches for these helpfiles and performs several
other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command.
<P>

There may already be a directory of help files on your system; look in
<B>/usr/share/zsh</B> or <B>/usr/local/share/zsh</B> and subdirectories below
those, or ask your system administrator.
<P>

To create your own help files with <B>helpfiles</B>, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside.  For
example, you might choose <B>~/zsh_help</B>.  If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>mkdir ~/zsh_help
cd ~/zsh_help
man zshall | colcrt - | \ 
perl ~/zsh-4.2.0/Util/helpfiles</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Next, to use the <B>run-help</B> function, you need to add lines something
like the following to your <B>.zshrc</B> or equivalent startup file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>unalias run-help
autoload run-help
HELPDIR=~/zsh_help</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <B>HELPDIR</B> parameter tells <B>run-help</B> where to look for the help
files.  If your system already has a help file directory installed, set
<B>HELPDIR</B> to the path of that directory instead.
<P>

Note that in order for `<B>autoload run-help</B>' to work, the <B>run-help</B>
file must be in one of the directories named in your <B>fpath</B> array (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1)).  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy <B>Functions/Misc/run-help</B> to an
appropriate directory.
<P>

<A NAME="lbIH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Recompiling Functions</H3>

<P>

If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh
installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the <B>zcompile</B> builtin are frequently out of date
with respect to the function source files.  This is not usually a problem,
because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but
it may cause slower shell startup and function loading.  Also, if a digest
file is explicitly used as an element of <B>fpath</B>, zsh won't check whether
any of its source files has changed.
<P>

The <B>zrecompile</B> autoloadable function, found in <B>Functions/Misc</B>, can
be used to keep function digests up to date.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zrecompile</B> [ <B>-qt</B> ] [ <I>name</I> ... ]
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zrecompile</B> [ <B>-qt</B> ] <B>-p</B> <I>args</I> [ <B>-</B><B>-</B> <I>args</I> ... ]
This tries to find <B>*.zwc</B> files and automatically re-compile them if at
least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file.  This
works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are
relative to the directory that contains the <B>.zwc</B> file.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

In the first form, each <I>name</I> is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing <B>*.zwc</B> files that should be checked.  If no
arguments are given, the directories and <B>*.zwc</B> files in <B>fpath</B> are
used.
<P>

When <B>-t</B> is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re-compiled and
non-zero (false) otherwise.  The <B>-q</B> option quiets the chatty output
that describes what <B>zrecompile</B> is doing.
<P>

Without the <B>-t</B> option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re-compilation could be compiled and non-zero if compilation for at
least one of the files failed.
<P>

If the <B>-p</B> option is given, the <I>args</I> are interpreted as one
or more sets of arguments for <B>zcompile</B>, separated by `<B>-</B><B>-</B>'.
For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zrecompile -p \ 
           -R ~/.zshrc -- \ 
           -M ~/.zcompdump -- \ 
           ~/zsh/comp.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This compiles <B>~/.zshrc</B> into <B>~/.zshrc.zwc</B> if that doesn't exist or
if it is older than <B>~/.zshrc</B>. The compiled file will be marked for
reading instead of mapping. The same is done for <B>~/.zcompdump</B> and
<B>~/.zcompdump.zwc</B>, but this compiled file is marked for mapping. The
last line re-creates the file <B>~/zsh/comp.zwc</B> if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it.
<P>

Without the <B>-p</B> option, <B>zrecompile</B> does not create function digests
that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest.
</DL>


</DL>
<P>

The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your <B>fpath</B>, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>for ((i=1; i &lt;= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (.|..) || $dir == (.|..)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N-.))
  if [[ -w $dir:h &amp;&amp; -n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
    if ( cd $dir:h &amp;&amp;
         zrecompile -p -U -z $zwc $files ); then
      fpath[i]=$fpath[i].zwc
    fi
  fi
done</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The <B>-U</B> and <B>-z</B> options are appropriate for functions in the default
zsh installation <B>fpath</B>; you may need to use different options for your
personal function directories.
<P>

Once the digests have been created and your <B>fpath</B> modified to refer to
them, you can keep them up to date by running <B>zrecompile</B> with no
arguments.
<P>

<A NAME="lbII">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Keyboard Definition</H3>

<P>

The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built-in key bindings for every situation.  The <B>zkbd</B> utility,
found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration.
<P>

Run <B>zkbd</B> either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zsh -f ~/zsh-4.2.0/Functions/Misc/zkbd</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

When you run <B>zkbd</B>, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return.  It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; <B>zkbd</B> warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither <B>^H</B> nor <B>^?</B>.
<P>

The keystrokes read by <B>zkbd</B> are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named <B>key</B>, written to a file in the subdirectory
<B>.zkbd</B> within either your <B>HOME</B> or <B>ZDOTDIR</B> directory.  The name
of the file is composed from the <B>TERM</B>, <B>VENDOR</B> and <B>OSTYPE</B>
parameters, joined by hyphens.
<P>

You may read this file into your <B>.zshrc</B> or another startup file with
the &quot;source&quot; or &quot;.&quot; commands, then reference the <B>key</B> parameter in
bindkey commands, like this:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE
[[ -n ${key[Left]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Left]}&quot; backward-char
[[ -n ${key[Right]} ]] &amp;&amp; bindkey &quot;${key[Right]}&quot; forward-char
# etc.</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Note that in order for `<B>autoload zkbd</B>' to work, the <B>zkdb</B> file must
be in one of the directories named in your <B>fpath</B> array (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1)).  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy <B>Functions/Misc/zkbd</B> to an
appropriate directory.
<P>

<A NAME="lbIJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Dumping Shell State</H3>

<P>

Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zsh.1.php">zsh</A></I>(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your
environment in order to track the problem down.
<P>

The script named <B>reporter</B>, found in the <B>Util</B> directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose.  (It is also possible to
<B>autoload reporter</B>, but <B>reporter</B> is not installed in <B>fpath</B>
by default.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state,
in the form of another script that can be read with `<B>zsh -f</B>' to
recreate that state.
<P>

To use <B>reporter</B>, read the script into your shell with the `<B>.</B>'
command and redirect the output into a file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>. ~/zsh-4.2.0/Util/reporter &gt; zsh.report</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

You should check the <B>zsh.report</B> file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it's best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it.
<P>

You can also use <B>reporter</B> to dump only a subset of the shell state.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the <B>aliases</B>, <B>options</B>, and
<B>zstyles</B> states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults.  The <B>bindings</B> state may be useful if you have created
any of your own keymaps, because <B>reporter</B> arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap.
<P>

As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
<B>reporter</B>, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands.
Note that if you're using the new completion system, you should <I>not</I>
dump the <B>functions</B> state to your startup files with <B>reporter</B>; use
the <B>compdump</B> function instead (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompsys.1.php">zshcompsys</A></I>(1)).
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>

<H3>Installation</H3>

<P>

You should make sure all the functions from the <B>Functions/Prompts</B>
directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with
the string `<B>prompt_</B>' except for the special function`<B>promptinit</B>'.
You also need the `<B>colors</B>' function from <B>Functions/Misc</B>.  All of
these functions may already have been installed on your system; if not,
you will need to find them and copy them.  The directory should appear as
one of the elements of the <B>fpath</B> array (this should already be the
case if they were installed), and at least the function <B>promptinit</B>
should be autoloaded; it will autoload the rest.  Finally, to initialize
the use of the system you need to call the <B>promptinit</B> function.  The
following code in your <B>.zshrc</B> will arrange for this; assume the
functions are stored in the directory <B>~/myfns</B>:

<B>prompt</B> [ <B>-s</B> ] <I>theme</I> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]
Set or examine the prompt theme.  With no options and a <I>theme</I>
argument, the theme with that name is set as the current theme.  The
available themes are determined at run time; use the <B>-l</B> option to see
a list.  The special <I>theme</I> `<B>random</B>' selects at random one of the
available themes and sets your prompt to that.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

In some cases the <I>theme</I> may be modified by one or more arguments,
which should be given after the theme name.  See the help for each theme
for descriptions of these arguments.

Options are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>

bash-style word functions
If you are looking for functions to implement moving over and editing
words in the manner of bash, where only alphanumeric characters are
considered word characters, you can use the functions described in
the next section.  The following is sufficient:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>autoload -U select-word-style
select-word-style bash</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>forward-word-match</B>, <B>backward-word-match</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>kill-word-match</B>, <B>backward-kill-word-match</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>transpose-words-match</B>, <B>capitalize-word-match</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>up-case-word-match</B>, <B>down-case-word-match</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>select-word-style</B>, <B>match-words-by-style</B>
The eight `<B>-match</B>' functions are drop-in replacements for the
builtin widgets without the suffix.  By default they behave in a similar
way.  However, by the use of styles and the function <B>select-word-style</B>,
the way words are matched can be altered.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
<B>select-word-style</B>, which can either be called as a normal function with
the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user-defined widget that will
prompt for the first character of the word style to be used.  The first
time it is invoked, the eight <B>-match</B> functions will automatically
replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly.
<P>

The word styles available are as follows.  Only the first character
is examined.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>bash</B>
Word characters are alphanumeric characters only.
<DT><B>normal</B><DD>
As in normal shell operation:  word characters are alphanumeric characters
plus any characters present in the string given by the parameter
<B>$WORDCHARS</B>.
<DT><B>shell</B><DD>
Words are complete shell command arguments, possibly including complete
quoted strings, or any tokens special to the shell.
<DT><B>whitespace</B><DD>
Words are any set of characters delimited by whitespace.
<DT><B>default</B><DD>
Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as `<B>normal</B>'.
</DL>
<P>

More control can be obtained using the <B>zstyle</B> command, as described in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).  Each style is looked up in the
context <B>:zle:</B><I>widget</I> where <I>widget</I> is the name of the
user-defined widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in
the case of the definitions supplied by <B>select-word-style</B> the
appropriate contexts are <B>:zle:forward-word</B>, and so on.  The function
<B>select-word-style</B> itself always defines styles for the context
`<B>:zle:*</B>' which can be overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as
well as explicit contexts.
<P>

The style <B>word-style</B> specifies the rules to use.  This may have the
following values.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>normal</B>
Use the standard shell rules, i.e. alphanumerics and <B>$WORDCHARS</B>, unless
overridden by the styles <B>word-chars</B> or <B>word-class</B>.
<DT><B>specified</B><DD>
Similar to <B>normal</B>, but <I>only</I> the specified characters, and not also
alphanumerics, are considered word characters.
<DT><B>unspecified</B><DD>
The negation of specified.  The given characters are those which will
<I>not</I> be considered part of a word.
<DT><B>shell</B><DD>
Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating shell
command arguments.  In addition, special tokens which are never command
arguments such as `<B>()</B>' are also treated as words.
<DT><B>whitespace</B><DD>
Words are whitespace-delimited strings of characters.
</DL>
<P>

The first three of those styles usually use <B>$WORDCHARS</B>, but the value
in the parameter can be overridden by the style <B>word-chars</B>, which works
in exactly the same way as <B>$WORDCHARS</B>.  In addition, the style
<B>word-class</B> uses character class syntax to group characters and takes
precedence over <B>word-chars</B> if both are set.  The <B>word-class</B> style
does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, `<B>-:[:alnum:]</B>' is a valid <B>word-class</B> to include all
alphanumerics plus the characters `<B>-</B>' and `<B>:</B>'.  Be careful
including `<B>]</B>', `<B>^</B>' and `<B>-</B>' as these are special inside
character classes.
<P>

The final style is <B>skip-chars</B>.  This is mostly useful for
<B>transpose-words</B> and similar functions.  If set, it gives a count of
characters starting at the cursor position which will not be considered
part of the word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually
are.  For example, if
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':zle:transpose-words' skip-chars 1</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

has been set, and <B>transpose-words-match</B> is called with the cursor on
the <I>X</I> of <B>foo</B><I>X</I><B>bar</B>, where <I>X</I> can be any character, then
the resulting expression is <B>bar</B><I>X</I><B>foo</B>.
<P>

Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from the
simplified interface in <B>select-word-style</B>:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':zle:*' word-style standard
zstyle ':zle:*' word-chars ''</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Implements bash-style word handling for all widgets, i.e. only
alphanumerics are word characters; equivalent to setting
the parameter <B>WORDCHARS</B> empty for the given context.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>style ':zle:*kill*' word-style space</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Uses space-delimited words for widgets with the word `kill' in the name.
Neither of the styles <B>word-chars</B> nor <B>word-class</B> is used in this case.
<P>

The word matching and all the handling of <B>zstyle</B> settings is actually
implemented by the function <B>match-words-by-style</B>.  This can be used to
create new user-defined widgets.  The calling function should set the local
parameter <B>curcontext</B> to <B>:zle:</B><I>widget</I>, create the local
parameter <B>matched_words</B> and call <B>match-words-by-style</B> with no
arguments.  On return, <B>matched_words</B> will be set to an array with the
elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any
non-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non-word
character at the cursor position plus any remaining non-word characters
before the next word, including all characters specified by the
<B>skip-chars</B> style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any
non-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line.  Any
of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test
for this to decide whether it can perform its function.
</DL>

<DT><B>delete-whole-word-match</B><DD>
This is another function which works like the <B>-match</B> functions
described immediately above, i.e. using styles to decide the word
boundaries.  However, it is not a replacement for any existing function.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The basic behaviour is to delete the word around the cursor.  There is no
numeric prefix handling; only the single word around the cursor is
considered.  If the widget contains the string <B>kill</B>, the removed text
will be placed in the cutbuffer for future yanking.  This can be obtained
by defining <B>kill-whole-word-match</B> as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

and then binding the widget <B>kill-whole-word-match</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>copy-earlier-word</B><DD>
This widget works like a combination of <B>insert-last-word</B> and
<B>copy-prev-shell-word</B>.  Repeated invocations of the widget retrieve
earlier words on the relevant history line.  With a numeric argument
<I>N</I>, insert the <I>N</I>th word from the history line; <I>N</I> may be
negative to count from the end of the line.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If <B>insert-last-word</B> has been used to retrieve the last word on a
previous history line, repeated invocations will replace that word with
earlier words from the same line.
<P>

Otherwise, the widget applies to words on the line currently being edited.
The <B>widget</B> style can be set to the name of another widget that should
be called to retrieve words.  This widget must accept the same three
arguments as <B>insert-last-word</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>cycle-completion-positions</B><DD>
After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the new
function based completion system may know about multiple places in
this string where characters are missing or differ from at least one
of the possible matches.  It will then place the cursor on the
position it considers to be the most interesting one, i.e. the one
where one can disambiguate between as many matches as possible with as 
little typing as possible.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved to the other interesting
spots.  It can be invoked repeatedly to cycle between all positions
reported by the completion system.
</DL>

<DT><B>edit-command-line</B><DD>
Edit the command line using your visual editor, as in <B>ksh</B>.

</DL>

<DT><B>history-search-end</B><DD>
This function implements the widgets
<B>history-beginning-search-backward-end</B> and
<B>history-beginning-search-forward-end</B>.  These commands work by first
calling the corresponding builtin widget (see
`History Control' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1)) and then moving the cursor to the end of the line.  The original cursor
position is remembered and restored before calling the builtin widget a
second time, so that the same search is repeated to look farther through
the history.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Although you <B>autoload</B> only one function, the commands to use it are
slightly different because it implements two widgets.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end \

bindkey '\e^N' history-beginning-search-forward-end</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>up-line-or-beginning-search</B>, <B>down-line-or-beginning-search</B><DD>
These widgets are similar to the builtin functions <B>up-line-or-search</B>
and <B>down-line-or-search</B>:  if in a multiline buffer they move up or
down within the buffer, otherwise they search for a history line matching
the start of the current line.  In this case, however, they search for
a line which matches the current line up to the current cursor position, in
the manner of <B>history-beginning-search-backward</B> and <B>-forward</B>, rather
than the first word on the line.
<DT><B>incarg</B><DD>
Typing the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor placed on or to the
left of an integer causes that integer to be incremented by one.  With a
numeric prefix argument, the number is incremented by the amount of the
argument (decremented if the prefix argument is negative).  The shell
parameter <B>incarg</B> may be set to change the default increment something
other than one.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey '^X+' incarg</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>incremental-complete-word</B><DD>
This allows incremental completion of a word.  After starting this
command, a list of completion choices can be shown after every character
you type, which you can delete with <B>^H</B> or <B>DEL</B>.  Pressing return
accepts the completion so far and returns you to normal editing (that is,
the command line is <I>not</I> immediately executed).  You can hit <B>TAB</B> to
do normal completion, <B>^G</B> to abort back to the state when you started,
and <B>^D</B> to list the matches.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This works only with the new function based completion system.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey '^Xi' incremental-complete-word</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>insert-files</B><DD>
This function allows you type a file pattern, and see the results of the
expansion at each step.  When you hit return, all expansions are inserted
into the command line.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT>
<DD>
<B>narrow-to-region-invisible</B>
Narrow the editable portion of the buffer to the region between the cursor
and the mark, which may be in either order.  The region may not be empty.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<B>narrow-to-region</B> may be used as a widget or called as a function from a
user-defined widget; by default, the text outside the editable area remains
visible.  A <B>recursive-edit</B> is performed and the original widening
status is then restored.  Various options and arguments are available when
it is called as a function.
<P>

The options <B>-p</B> <I>pretext</I> and <B>-P</B> <I>posttext</I> may be
used to replace the text before and after the display for the duration of
the function; either or both may be an empty string.
<P>

If the option <B>-n</B> is also given, <I>pretext</I> or <I>posttext</I> will only
be inserted if there is text before or after the region respectively which
will be made invisible.
<P>

Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used instead of the cursor
and mark positions.
<P>

The option <B>-S</B> <I>statepm</I> is used to narrow according to the other
options while saving the original state in the parameter with name
<I>statepm</I>, while the option <B>-R</B> <I>statepm</I> is used to restore the
state from the parameter; note in both cases the <I>name</I> of the parameter
is required.  In the second case, other options and arguments are
irrelevant.  When this method is used, no <B>recursive-edit</B> is performed;
the calling widget should call this function with the option <B>-S</B>,
perform its own editing on the command line or pass control to the user
via `<B>zle recursive-edit</B>', then call this function with the option
<B>-R</B>.  The argument <I>statepm</I> must be a suitable name for an ordinary
parameter, except that parameters beginning with the prefix <B>_ntr_</B> are
reserved for use within <B>narrow-to-region</B>.  Typically the parameter will
be local to the calling function.
<P>

<B>narrow-to-region-invisible</B> is a simple widget which calls
<B>narrow-to-region</B> with arguments which replace any text outside the
region with `<B>...</B>'.
<P>

The display is restored (and the widget returns) upon any zle command
which would usually cause the line to be accepted or aborted.  Hence an
additional such command is required to accept or abort the current line.
<P>

The return status of both widgets is zero if the line was accepted, else
non-zero.
<P>

Here is a trivial example of a widget using this feature.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>local state
narrow-to-region -p $'Editing restricted region\n' \ 
  -P '' -S state
zle recursive-edit
narrow-to-region -R state</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>predict-on</B><DD>
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search.
After <B>predict-on</B>, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far.  After <B>predict-off</B>, editing returns to normal for the line found.
In fact, you often don't even need to use <B>predict-off</B>, because if the
line doesn't match something in the history, adding a key performs
standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction;
see the <B>toggle</B> style below.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you
should be able to type <B>TAB</B> at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ``interesting'' character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word).  And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first.
<P>

The first time <B>predict-on</B> is used, it creates several additional
widget functions:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>delete-backward-and-predict</B><DD>
Replaces the <B>backward-delete-char</B>
widget.  You do not need to bind this yourself.
<DT><B>insert-and-predict</B><DD>
Implements predictive typing by replacing the
<B>self-insert</B> widget.  You do not need to bind this yourself.
<DT><B>predict-off</B><DD>
Turns off predictive typing.

</DL>
<P>

Although you <B>autoload</B> only the <B>predict-on</B> function, it is
necessary to create a keybinding for <B>predict-off</B> as well.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -N predict-on
zle -N predict-off
bindkey '^X^Z' predict-on
bindkey '^Z' predict-off</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>read-from-minibuffer</B><DD>
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but will
work correctly as a widget in its own right.  It prompts for a value
below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the
standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available
when executing, for example, <B>execute-named-cmd</B>).  The value is then
returned to the calling function in the parameter <B>$REPLY</B> and the
editing buffer restored to its previous state.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically <B>^G</B>), the function returns status 1
and <B>$REPLY</B> is not set.  If an argument is supplied to the function
it is taken as a prompt, otherwise `<B>? </B>' is used.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

One option is available: `<B>-k</B> <I>num</I>' specifies that <I>num</I>
characters are to be read instead of a whole line.  The line editor is not
invoked recursively in this case.  Note that unlike the <B>read</B> builtin
<I>num</I> must be given; there is no default.
<P>

The name is a slight misnomer, as in fact the shell's own minibuffer is
not used.  Hence it is still possible to call <B>executed-named-cmd</B> and
similar functions while reading a value.
</DL>

<DT><B>replace-string</B>, <B>replace-pattern</B><DD>
The function <B>replace-string</B> implements two widgets.
If defined under the same name as the function, it prompts for two
strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the second
everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the widget name contains the word `<B>pattern</B>', for example by
defining the widget using the command `<B>zle -N replace-pattern
replace-string</B>', then the replacement is done by pattern matching.  All
zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note
that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect.  In addition, the
replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions.
Furthermore, a `<B>&amp;</B>' in the replacement string will be replaced with
the matched source string, and a backquoted digit `<B>\</B><I>N</I>' will be
replaced by the <I>N</I>th parenthesised expression matched.  The form
`<B>\{</B><I>N</I><B>}</B>' may be used to protect the digit from following
digits.
<P>

For example, starting from the line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>print This line contains fan and fond</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

and invoking <B>replace-pattern</B> with the source string `<B>f(?)n</B>' and
the replacment string `<B>c\1r</B>' produces the not very useful line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>print This line contains car and cord</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
<B>narrow-to-region-invisible</B> widget.  One limitation of the current
version is that <B>undo</B> will cycle through changes to the replacement
and source strings before undoing the replacement itself.
</DL>

<DT><B>smart-insert-last-word</B><DD>
This function may replace the <B>insert-last-word</B> widget, like so:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

With a numeric prefix, or when passed command line arguments in a call
from another widget, it behaves like <B>insert-last-word</B>, except that
words in comments are ignored when <B>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</B> is set.
<P>

Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting'' word from the previous command is
found and inserted.  The default definition of ``interesting'' is that the
word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or backslash.
This definition may be overridden by use of the <B>match</B> style.  The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the
context is <B>:insert-last-word</B>.  However, you can bind this function to
different widgets to use different patterns:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word
zstyle :insert-last-assignment match '[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*'
bindkey '\e=' insert-last-assignment</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

</DL>


</DL>
<P>

<A NAME="lbIP">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Styles</H3>

<P>

The behavior of several of the above widgets can be controlled by the use
of the <B>zstyle</B> mechanism.  In particular, widgets that interact with
the completion system pass along their context to any completions that
they invoke.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>break-keys</B>
This style is used by the <B>incremental-complete-word</B> widget. Its value
should be a pattern, and all keys matching this pattern will cause the
widget to stop incremental completion without the key having any further
effect. Like all styles used directly by
<B>incremental-complete-word</B>, this style is looked up using the
context `<B>:incremental</B>'.
<DT><B>completer</B><DD>
The <B>incremental-complete-word</B> and <B>insert-and-predict</B> widgets set
up their top-level context name before calling completion.  This allows
one to define different sets of completer functions for normal completion
and for these widgets.  For example, to use completion, approximation and
correction for normal completion, completion and correction for
incremental completion and only completion for prediction one could use:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':completion:*' completer \ 
        _complete _correct _approximate
zstyle ':completion:incremental:*' completer \ 
        _complete _correct
zstyle ':completion:predict:*' completer \ 
        _complete</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction, because
they may be automatically invoked as you type.  The <B>_list</B> and
<B>_menu</B> completers should never be used with prediction.  The
<B>_approximate</B>, <B>_correct</B>, <B>_expand</B>, and <B>_match</B> completers may
be used, but be aware that they may change characters anywhere in the word
behind the cursor, so you need to watch carefully that the result is what
you intended.
</DL>

<DT><B>cursor</B><DD>
The <B>insert-and-predict</B> widget uses this style, in the context
`<B>:predict</B>', to decide where to place the cursor after completion has
been tried.  Values are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>complete</B>
The cursor is left where it was when completion finished, but only if
it is after a character equal to the one just inserted by the user.  If 
it is after another character, this value is the same as `<B>key</B>'.
<DT><B>key</B><DD>
The cursor is left
after the <I>n</I>th occurrence of the character just inserted, where
<I>n</I> is the number of times that character appeared in the word
before completion was attempted.  In short, this has the effect of
leaving the cursor after the character just typed even if the
completion code found out that no other characters need to be inserted 
at that position.
</DL>
<P>

Any other value for this style unconditionally leaves the cursor at the
position where the completion code left it.
</DL>

<DT><B>list</B><DD>
When using the <B>incremental-complete-word</B> widget, this style says
if the matches should be listed on every key press (if they fit on the 
screen).  Use the context prefix `<B>:completion:incremental</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The <B>insert-and-predict</B> widget uses this style to decide if the
completion should be shown even if there is only one possible completion.
This is done if the value of this style is the string <B>always</B>.  In this
case the context is `<B>:predict</B>' (<I>not</I> `<B>:completion:predict</B>').
</DL>

<DT><B>match</B><DD>
This style is used by <B>smart-insert-last-word</B> to provide a pattern
(using full <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> syntax) that matches an interesting word.
The context is the name of the widget to which <B>smart-insert-last-word</B>
is bound (see above).  The default behavior of <B>smart-insert-last-word</B>
is equivalent to:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:]/\\]*'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

However, you might want to include words that contain spaces:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:][:space:]/\\]*'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Or include numbers as long as the word is at least two characters long:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle :insert-last-word match '*([[:digit:]]?|[[:alpha:]/\\])*'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

The above example causes redirections like &quot;2&gt;&quot; to be included.
</DL>

<DT><B>prompt</B><DD>
The <B>incremental-complete-word</B> widget shows the value of this
style in the status line during incremental completion.  The string
value may contain any of the following substrings in the manner of
the <B>PS1</B> and other prompt parameters:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>%c</B>
Replaced by the name of the completer function that generated the
matches (without the leading underscore).
<DT><B>%l</B><DD>
When the <B>list</B> style is set,
replaced by `<B>...</B>' if the list of matches is too long to fit on the
screen and with an empty string otherwise.  If the <B>list</B> style is
`false' or not set, `<B>%l</B>' is always removed.
<DT><B>%n</B><DD>
Replaced by the number of matches generated.
<DT><B>%s</B><DD>
Replaced by `<B>-no match-</B>', `<B>-no prefix-</B>', or an empty string
if there is no completion matching the word on the line, if the
matches have no common prefix different from the word on the line, or
if there is such a common prefix, respectively.
<DT><B>%u</B><DD>
Replaced by the unambiguous part of all matches, if there
is any, and if it is different from the word on the line.
</DL>
<P>

Like `<B>break-keys</B>', this uses the `<B>:incremental</B>' context.
</DL>

<DT><B>stop-keys</B><DD>
This style is used by the <B>incremental-complete-word</B> widget.  Its value
is treated similarly to the one for the <B>break-keys</B> style (and uses 
the same context: `<B>:incremental</B>').  However, in
this case all keys matching the pattern given as its value will stop
incremental completion and will then execute their usual function.
<DT><B>toggle</B><DD>
This boolean style is used by <B>predict-on</B> and its related widgets in
the context `<B>:predict</B>'.  If set to one of the standard `true' values,
predictive typing is automatically toggled off in situations where it is
unlikely to be useful, such as when editing a multi-line buffer or after
moving into the middle of a line and then deleting a character.  The
default is to leave prediction turned on until an explicit call to
<B>predict-off</B>.
<DT><B>verbose</B><DD>
This boolean style is used by <B>predict-on</B> and its related widgets in
the context `<B>:predict</B>'.  If set to one of the standard `true' values,
these widgets display a message below the prompt when the predictive state
is toggled.  This is most useful in combination with the <B>toggle</B> style.
The default does not display these messages.
<DT><B>widget</B><DD>
This style is similar to the <B>command</B> style: For widget functions that
use <B>zle</B> to call other widgets, this style can sometimes be used to
override the widget which is called.  The context for this style is the
name of the calling widget (<I>not</I> the name of the calling function,
because one function may be bound to multiple widget names).

<H2>MIME FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

Three functions are available to provide handling of files recognised by
extension, for example to dispatch a file <B>text.ps</B> when executed as a
command to an appropriate viewer.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zsh-mime-setup [-flv]</B>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>zsh-mime-handler</B>
These two functions use the files <B>~/.mime.types</B> and <B>/etc/mime.types</B>,
which associate types and extensions, as well as <B>~/.mailcap</B> and
<B>/etc/mailcap</B> files, which associate types and the programs that
handle them.  These are provided on many systems with the Multimedia
Internet Mail Extensions.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

To enable the system, the function <B>zsh-mime-setup</B> should be
autoloaded and run.  This allows files with extensions to be treated
as executable; such files be completed by the function completion system.
The function <B>zsh-mime-handler</B> should not need to be called by the
user.
<P>

The system works by setting up suffix aliases with `<B>alias -s</B>'.
Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be overwritten.
<P>

Repeated calls to <B>zsh-mime-setup</B> do not override the existing
mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the option <B>-f</B>
is given.  Note, however, that this does not override existing suffix
aliases assigned to handlers other than <B>zsh-mime-handler</B>.
Calling <B>zsh-mime-setup</B> with the option <B>-l</B> lists the existing
mapping without altering it.  Calling <B>zsh-mime-setup</B> with the option
<B>-v</B> causes verbose output to be shown during the setup operation.
<P>

The system respects the <B>mailcap</B> flags <B>needsterminal</B> and
<B>copiousoutput</B>, see <I><A HREF="../man4/mailcap.4.php">mailcap</A></I>(4).
<P>

The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the
<B>zstyle</B> builtin command (see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)).  They should be defined
before <B>zsh-mime-setup</B> is run.  The contexts used all
start with <B>:mime:</B>, with additional components in some cases.
It is recommended that a trailing <B>*</B> (suitably quoted) be appended
to style patterns in case the system is extended in future.  Some
examples are given below.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
mime-types
A list of files in the format of <B>~/.mime.types</B> and
<B>/etc/mime.types</B> to be read during setup, replacing the default list
which consists of those two files.  The context is <B>:mime:</B>.
<DT>mailcap<DD>
A list of files in the format of <B>~/.mailcap</B> and
<B>/etc/mailcap</B> to be read during setup, replacing the default list
which consists of those two files.  The context is <B>:mime:</B>.
<DT>handler<DD>
Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by the context as
<B>:mime:.</B><I>suffix</I><B>:</B>, and the format of the handler is exactly
that in <B>mailcap</B>.  Note in particular the `<B>.</B>' and trailing colon
to distinguish this use of the context.  This overrides any handler
specified by the <B>mailcap</B> files.  If the handler requires a terminal,
the <B>flags</B> style should be set to include the word <B>needsterminal</B>,
or if the output is to be displayed through a pager (but not if the
handler is itself a pager), it should include <B>copiousoutput</B>.
<DT>flags<DD>
Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for the
<B>handler</B> style, and the format is as for the flags in <B>mailcap</B>.
<DT>pager<DD>
If set, will be used instead of <B>$PAGER</B> or <B>more</B> to handle
suffixes where the <B>copiousoutput</B> flag is set.  The context is
as for <B>handler</B>, i.e. <B>:mime:.</B><I>suffix</I><B>:</B> for handling
a file with the given <I>suffix</I>.
</DL>
<P>

Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':mime:*' mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap
zstyle ':mime:.txt' handler less %s
zstyle ':mime:.txt' flags needsterminal</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

When <B>zsh-mime-setup</B> is subsequently run, it will look for
<B>mailcap</B> entries in the two files given.  Files of suffix <B>.txt</B>
will be handled by running `<B>less</B> <I>file.txt</I>'.  The flag
<B>needsterminal</B> is set to show that this program must run attached to a
terminal.
<P>

As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the following
should be checked if attempting to execute a file by extension
<B>.</B><I>ext</I> does not have the expected effect.
starteit()
eit()(
The command `<B>alias -s</B> <I>ext</I>' should show
`<B>ps=zsh-mime-handler</B>'.  If it shows something else, another suffix
alias was already installed and was not overwritten.  If it shows
nothing, no handler was installed:  this is most likely because no
handler was found in the <B>.mime.types</B> and <B>mailcap</B> combination for
<B>.ext</B> files.  In that case, appropriate handling should be added to
<B>~/.mime.types</B> and <B>mailcap</B>.
)
eit()(
If the extension is handled by <B>zsh-mime-handler</B> but the file is
not opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is
incorrect, or the flags associated with it are in appropriate.  Running
<B>zsh-mime-setup -l</B> will show the handler and, if there are any, the
flags.  A <B>%s</B> in the handler is replaced by the file (suitably quoted
if necessary).  Check that the handler program listed lists and can
be run in the way shown.  Also check that the flags <B>needsterminal</B> or
<B>copiousoutput</B> are set if the handler needs to be run under a
terminal; the second flag is used if the output should be sent to a pager.
An example of a suitable <B>mailcap</B> entry for such a program is:

<DT><B>pick-web-browser</B><DD>
This function is separate from the two MIME functions described above
and can be assigned directly to a suffix:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>autoload -U pick-web-browser
alias -s html=pick-web-browser</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

It is provided as an intelligent front end to dispatch a web browser.
It will check if an X Windows display is available, and if so
if there is already a browser running which can accept a remote
connection.  In that case, the file will be displayed in that browser;
you should check explicitly if it has appeared in the running browser's
window.  Otherwise, it will start a new browser according to a builtin
set of preferences.
<P>

Alternatively, <B>pick-web-browser</B> can be run as a zsh script.
<P>

Two styles are available to customize the choice of browsers:
<B>x-browsers</B> when running under the X Windows System, and
<B>tty-browsers</B> otherwise.  These are arrays in decreasing order
of preference consiting of the command name under which to start the
browser.  They are looked up in the context <B>:mime:</B> (which may
be extended in future, so appending `<B>*</B>' is recommended).  For
example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle ':mime:*' x-browsers opera konqueror netscape</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

specifies that <B>pick-web-browser</B> should first look for a runing
instance of Opera, Konqueror or Netscape, in that order, and if it
fails to find any should attempt to start Opera.

<H2>OTHER FUNCTIONS</H2>

<P>

There are a large number of helpful functions in the <B>Functions/Misc</B>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>colors</B>
This function initializes several associative arrays to map color names to
(and from) the ANSI standard eight-color terminal codes.  These are used
by the prompt theme system (see above).  You seldom should need to run
<B>colors</B> more than once.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The eight base colors are: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
and white.  Each of these has codes for foreground and background.  In
addition there are eight intensity attributes: bold, faint, standout,
underline, blink, reverse, and conceal.  Finally, there are six codes used
to negate attributes: none (reset all attributes to the defaults), normal
(neither bold nor faint), no-standout, no-underline, no-blink, and
no-reverse.
<P>

Some terminals do not support all combinations of colors and intensities.
<P>

The associative arrays are:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
color
<DT>
<DD>
colour
Map all the color names to their integer codes, and integer codes to the
color names.  The eight base names map to the foreground color codes, as
do names prefixed with `<B>fg-</B>', such as `<B>fg-red</B>'.  Names prefixed
with `<B>bg-</B>', such as `<B>bg-blue</B>', refer to the background codes.  The
reverse mapping from code to color yields base name for foreground codes
and the <B>bg-</B> form for backgrounds.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Although it is a misnomer to call them `colors', these arrays also map the
other fourteen attributes from names to codes and codes to names.
</DL>

<DT>
<DD>
fg
<DT>
<DD>
fg_bold
<DT>
<DD>
fg_no_bold
Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape sequences that set
the corresponding foreground text properties.  The <B>fg</B> sequences change
the color without changing the eight intensity attributes.
<DT>
<DD>
bg
<DT>
<DD>
bg_bold
<DT>
<DD>
bg_no_bold
Map the eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape sequences that set
the corresponding background properties.  The <B>bg</B> sequences change the
color without changing the eight intensity attributes.
</DL>
<P>

In addition, the scalar parameters <B>reset_color</B> and <B>bold_color</B> are
set to the ANSI terminal escapes that turn off all attributes and turn on
bold intensity, respectively.
</DL>

<DT><B>fned</B> <I>name</I><DD>
Same as <B>zed -f</B>.  This function does not appear in the zsh
distribution, but can be created by linking <B>zed</B> to the name <B>fned</B>
in some directory in your <B>fpath</B>.
<DT><B>is-at-least</B> <I>needed</I> [ <I>present</I> ]<DD>
Perform a greater-than-or-equal-to comparison of two strings having the
format of a zsh version number; that is, a string of numbers and text with
segments separated by dots or dashes.  If the <I>present</I> string is not
provided, <B>$ZSH_VERSION</B> is used.  Segments are paired left-to-right in
the two strings with leading non-number parts ignored.  If one string has
fewer segments than the other, the missing segments are considered zero.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This is useful in startup files to set options and other state that are
not available in all versions of zsh.

<DT><B>nslookup</B> [ <I>arg</I> ... ]<DD>
This wrapper function for the <B>nslookup</B> command requires the
<B>zsh/zpty</B> module (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)).  It behaves exactly like the standard <B>nslookup</B>
except that it provides customizable prompts (including a right-side
prompt) and completion of nslookup commands, host names, etc. (if you use
the function-based completion system).  Completion styles may be set with
the context prefix `<B>:completion:nslookup</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

See also the <B>pager</B>, <B>prompt</B> and <B>rprompt</B> styles below.
</DL>

<DT><B>run-help</B><DD>
See `Accessing On-Line Help'
above.
<DT><B>tetris</B><DD>
Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as Emacs,
because it lacked a Tetris game.  This function was written to
refute this vicious slander.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This function must be used as a ZLE widget:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>autoload -U tetris
zle -N tetris
bindkey </B><I>keys</I> tetris
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

To start a game, execute the widget by typing the <I>keys</I>.  Whatever command
line you were editing disappears temporarily, and your keymap is also
temporarily replaced by the Tetris control keys.  The previous editor state
is restored when you quit the game (by pressing `<B>q</B>') or when you lose.
<P>

If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation of the <B>tetris</B>
widget will continue where you left off.  If you lost, it will start a new
game.
</DL>

<DT><B>zcalc</B> [ <I>expression</I> ... ]<DD>
A reasonably powerful calculator based on zsh's arithmetic evaluation
facility.  The syntax is similar to that of formulae in most programming
languages; see
the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmisc.1.php">zshmisc</A></I>(1) for details.  The mathematical
library <B>zsh/mathfunc</B> will be loaded if it is available; see
the section `The zsh/mathfunc Module' in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).  The mathematical functions
correspond to the raw system libraries, so trigonometric functions are
evaluated using radians, and so on.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Each line typed is evaluated as an expression.  The prompt shows a number,
which corresponds to a positional parameter where the result of that
calculation is stored.  For example, the result of the calculation on the
line preceded by `<B>4&gt; </B>' is available as <B>$4</B>.  Full command line
editing, including the history of previous calculations, is available; the
history is saved in the file <B>~/.zcalc_history</B>.  To exit, enter a blank
line or type `<B>q</B>' on its own.
<P>

If arguments are given to <B>zcalc</B> on start up, they are used to prime the
first few positional parameters.  A visual indication of this is given when
the calculator starts.
<P>

The constants <B>PI</B> (3.14159...) and <B>E</B> (2.71828...) are provided.
Parameter assignment is possible, but note that all parameters will be put
into the global namespace.
<P>

An extra facility is provided for changing the default output base.  Use,
for example, `<B>[#16]</B>' to display hexadecimal output preceded by an
indication of the base, or `<B>[##16]</B>' just to display the raw number in
the given base.  Bases themselves are always specified in decimal.
`<B>[#]</B>' restores the normal output format.
<P>

The output base can be initialised by passing the option `<B>-#</B><I>base</I>',
for example `<B>zcalc -#16</B>' (the `<B>#</B>' may have to be quoted, depending
on the globbing options set).
<P>

The prompt is configurable via the parameter <B>ZCALCPROMPT</B>, which
undergoes standard prompt expansion.  The index of the current entry is
stored locally in the first element of the array <B>psvar</B>, which can be
referred to in <B>ZCALCPROMPT</B> as `<B>%1v</B>'.  The default prompt is
`<B>%1v&gt; </B>'.
<P>

See the comments in the function for a few extra tips.
</DL>

<DT><B>zed</B> [ <B>-f</B> ] <I>name</I><DD>
This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function.  It rebinds
the return key to insert a line break, and adds bindings for `<B>^X^W</B>' in
the <B>emacs</B> keymap and `<B>ZZ</B>' in the <B>vicmd</B> keymap to accept (and
therefore write, in the case of a file) the edited file or function.
Keybindings are otherwise the standard ones; completion is available, and
styles may be set with the context prefix `<B>:completion:zed</B>'.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Only one <I>name</I> argument is recognized (additional arguments are
ignored).  If the <B>-f</B> option is given, the name is taken to be that of
a function; if the function is marked for autoloading, <B>zed</B> searches
for it in the <B>fpath</B> and loads it.  Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but <I>not</I> written back to the
autoload file.
<P>

Without <B>-f</B>, <I>name</I> is the path name of the file to edit, which need
not exist; it is created on write, if necessary.

<B>zln</B> [ <B>-finqQsvwW</B> ] <I>srcpat</I> <I>dest</I>
Same as <B>zmv -C</B> and <B>zmv -L</B>, respectively.  These functions do not
appear in the zsh distribution, but can be created by linking <B>zmv</B> to
the names <B>zcp</B> and <B>zln</B> in some directory in your <B>fpath</B>.
<DT><B>zkbd</B><DD>
See `Keyboard Definition'

Move (usually, rename) files matching the pattern <I>srcpat</I> to
corresponding files having names of the form given by <I>dest</I>, where
<I>srcpat</I> contains parentheses surrounding patterns which will be
replaced in turn by $1, $2, ... in <I>dest</I>.  For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zmv '(*).lis' '$1.txt'</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

renames `<B>foo.lis</B>' to `<B>foo.txt</B>', `<B>my.old.stuff.lis</B>' to
`<B>my.old.stuff.txt</B>', and so on.
<P>

The pattern is always treated as an <B>EXTENDED_GLOB</B> pattern.  Any file
whose name is not changed by the substitution is simply ignored.  Any
error (a substitution resulted in an empty string, two substitutions gave
the same result, the destination was an existing regular file and <B>-f</B>
was not given) causes the entire function to abort without doing anything.
<P>

Options:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-f</B><DD>
Force overwriting of destination files.  Not currently
passed down to the <B>mv</B>/<B>cp</B>/<B>ln</B> command due to vagaries of
implementations (but you can use <B>-o-f</B> to do that).
<DT><B>-i</B><DD>
Interactive: show each line to be executed and ask the user
whether to execute it.  `Y' or `y' will execute it, anything else will
skip it.  Note that you just need to type one character.
<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
No execution: print what would happen, but don't do it.
<DT><B>-q</B><DD>
Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so
this has no effect.
<DT><B>-Q</B><DD>
Force bare glob qualifiers on.  Don't turn this on unless
you are actually using glob qualifiers in a pattern.
<DT><B>-s</B><DD>
Symbolic, passed down to <B>ln</B>; only works with <B>-L</B>.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
Verbose: print each command as it's being executed.
<DT><B>-w</B><DD>
Pick out wildcard parts of the pattern, as described above,
and implicitly add parentheses for referring to them.
<DT><B>-W</B><DD>
Just like <B>-w</B>, with the addition of turning wildcards in
the replacement pattern into sequential ${1} .. ${N} references.
<DT><B>-C</B><DD>
<DT><B>-L</B><DD>
<DT><B>-M</B><DD>
Force <B>cp</B>, <B>ln</B> or <B>mv</B>, respectively, regardless of
the name of the function.
<DT><B>-p</B> <I>program</I><DD>
Call <I>program</I> instead of <B>cp</B>, <B>ln</B> or
<B>mv</B>.  Whatever it does, it should at least understand the form
`<I>program</I> <B>-</B><B>-</B> <I>oldname</I> <I>newname</I>'
where <I>oldname</I> and <I>newname</I> are filenames generated by <B>zmv</B>.
<DT><B>-o</B> <I>optstring</I><DD>
The <I>optstring</I> is split into words and
passed down verbatim to the <B>cp</B>, <B>ln</B> or <B>mv</B> command called to
perform the work.  It should probably begin with a `<B>-</B>'.

</DL>
<P>

For more complete examples and other implementation details, see the
<B>zmv</B> source file, usually located in one of the directories named in
your <B>fpath</B>, or in <B>Functions/Misc/zmv</B> in the zsh distribution.

<DT><B>zstyle+</B> <I>context</I> <I>style</I> <I>value</I> [ + <I>subcontext</I> <I>style</I> <I>value</I> ... ]<DD>
This makes defining styles a bit simpler by using a single `<B>+</B>' as a
special token that allows you to append a context name to the previously
used context name.  Like this:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zstyle+ ':foo:bar' style1 value1 \ 
      + ':baz'     style2 value2 \ 
      + ':frob'    style3 value3</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This defines `style1' with `value1' for the context <B>:foo:bar</B> as usual,
but it also defines `style2' with `value2' for the context
<B>:foo:bar:baz</B> and `style3' with `value3' for <B>:foo:bar:frob</B>.  Any
<I>subcontext</I> may be the empty string to re-use the first context
unchanged.
