<H2>NAME </H2>

gpg --- encryption and signing tool 
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<P>

<PRE>

<B>gpg</B>  [--homedir <B>name</B>]  [--options <B>file</B>]  [<B>options</B>]  <B>command</B>  [<B>args</B>]    
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<P>

<B>gpg</B> is the main program for the GnuPG system. 
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>

This man page only lists the commands and options available.  For more 
verbose documentation get the GNU Privacy Handbook (GPH) or one of the 
other documents at <A HREF="http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/">http://www.gnupg.org/documentation/</A> . 
<P>

Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non option is 
encountered, you can explicitly stop option parsing by using the 
special option &quot;--&quot;. 
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMANDS </H2>

<P>

<B>gpg</B> may be run with no commands, in which case it will 
perform a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given 
as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified, 
a file containing keys is listed). 
<P>

<B>gpg</B> recognizes these commands: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-s, --sign<DD>
Make a signature. This command may be combined 
with --encrypt. 
<DT>--clearsign<DD>
Make a clear text signature. 
<DT>-b, --detach-sign<DD>
Make a detached signature. 
<DT>-e, --encrypt<DD>
Encrypt data. This option may be combined with --sign. 
<DT>-c, --symmetric<DD>
Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase.  The default 
symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be chosen with the 
--cipher-algo option. 
<DT>--store<DD>
Store only (make a simple RFC1991 packet). 
<DT>--decrypt [<B>file</B>]<DD>
Decrypt <B>file</B> (or stdin if no file is specified) and 
write it to stdout (or the file specified with 
--output). If the decrypted file is signed, the 
signature is also verified. This command differs 
from the default operation, as it never writes to the 
filename which is included in the file and it 
rejects files which don't begin with an encrypted 
message. 
<DT>--verify [[<B>sigfile</B>]  [<B>signed-files</B>]]<DD>
Assume that <B>sigfile</B> is a signature and verify it 
without generating any output.<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>With no arguments, <BR>
the signature packet is read from stdin.  If 
only a sigfile is given, it may be a complete 
signature or a detached signature, in which case 
the signed stuff is expected in a file without the 
&quot;.sig&quot; or &quot;.asc&quot; extension.  
With more than 
1 argument, the first should be a detached signature 
and the remaining files are the signed stuff.  To read the signed 
stuff from stdin, use <B>-</B> as the second filename. 
For security reasons a detached signature cannot read the signed 
material from stdin without denoting it in the above way. 
<DT>--multifile<DD>
This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for 
processing on the command line or read from stdin with each filename 
on a separate line.  This allows for many files to be processed at 
once.  --multifile may currently be used along with --verify, 
--encrypt, and --decrypt.  Note that `--multifile --verify' may not be 
used with detached signatures. 
<DT>--verify-files [<B>files</B>]<DD>
Identical to `--multifile --verify'. 
<DT>--encrypt-files [<B>files</B>]<DD>
Identical to `--multifile --encrypt'. 
<DT>--decrypt-files [<B>files</B>]<DD>
Identical to `--multifile --decrypt'. 
<DT>--list-keys [<B>names</B>]<DD>
<DT>--list-public-keys [<B>names</B>]<DD>
List all keys from the public keyrings, or just the ones given on the 
command line. 
<DT><DD>
Avoid using the output of this command in scripts or other programs as 
it is likely to change as GnuPG changes.  See --with-colons for a 
machine-parseable key listing command that is appropriate for use in 
scripts and other programs. 
<DT>--list-secret-keys [<B>names</B>]<DD>
List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the ones given on the 
command line.  A '#' after the letters 'sec' means that the secret key 
is not usable (for example, if it was created via 
--export-secret-subkeys). 
<DT>--list-sigs [<B>names</B>]<DD>
Same as --list-keys, but the signatures are listed too. 
<DT><DD>
For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the 
&quot;sig&quot; tag and keyid.  These flags give additional information about 
each signature.  From left to right, they are the numbers 1-3 for 
certificate check level (see --ask-cert-level), &quot;L&quot; for a local or 
non-exportable signature (see --lsign-key), &quot;R&quot; for a nonRevocable 
signature (see --nrsign-key), &quot;P&quot; for a signature that contains a 
policy URL (see --cert-policy-url), &quot;N&quot; for a signature that contains 
a notation (see --cert-notation), and &quot;X&quot; for an eXpired signature 
(see --ask-cert-expire). 
<DT>--check-sigs [<B>names</B>]<DD>
Same as --list-sigs, but the signatures are verified. 
<DT>--fingerprint [<B>names</B>]<DD>
List all keys with their fingerprints. This is the 
same output as --list-keys but with the additional output 
of a line with the fingerprint. May also be combined 
with --list-sigs or --check-sigs. 
If this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all 
secondary keys are listed too. 
<DT>--list-packets<DD>
List only the sequence of packets. This is mainly 
useful for debugging. 
<DT>--gen-key<DD>
Generate a new key pair. This command is normally only used 
interactively. 
<DT><DD>
There is an experimental feature which allows you to create keys 
in batch mode. See the file <B>doc/DETAILS</B> in the source distribution on how to use this. 
<DT>--edit-key <B>name</B><DD>
Present a menu which enables you to do all key 
related tasks: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>sign<DD>
Make a signature on key of user <B>name</B> If the key is not yet signed by the default 
user (or the users given with -u), the 
program displays the information of the key 
again, together with its fingerprint and 
asks whether it should be signed. This 
question is repeated for all users specified 
with -u. 
<DT>lsign<DD>
Same as --sign but the signature is marked as 
non-exportable and will therefore never be used 
by others.  This may be used to make keys valid 
only in the local environment. 
<DT>nrsign<DD>
Same as --sign but the signature is marked as non-revocable and can 
therefore never be revoked. 
<DT>nrlsign<DD>
Combines the functionality of nrsign and lsign to make a signature 
that is both non-revocable and 
non-exportable. 
<DT>revsig<DD>
Revoke a signature.  For every signature which has been generated by 
one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a revocation certificate 
should be generated. 
<DT>trust<DD>
Change the owner trust value. This updates the 
trust-db immediately and no save is required. 
<DT>disable<DD>
<DT>enable<DD>
Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not normally be 
used for encryption. 
<DT>adduid<DD>
Create an alternate user id. 
<DT>addphoto<DD>
Create a photographic user id.  This will prompt for a JPEG file that 
will be embedded into the user ID.  Note that a very large JPEG will 
make for a very large key. 
<DT>deluid<DD>
Delete a user id. 
<DT>delsig<DD>
Delete a signature. 
<DT>revuid<DD>
Revoke a user id. 
<DT>addkey<DD>
Add a subkey to this key. 
<DT>delkey<DD>
Remove a subkey. 
<DT>addrevoker [sensitive]<DD>
Add a designated revoker.  This takes one optional argument: 
&quot;sensitive&quot;.  If a designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will 
not be exported by default (see 
export-options). 
<DT>revkey<DD>
Revoke a subkey. 
<DT>expire<DD>
Change the key expiration time.  If a subkey is selected, the 
expiration time of this subkey will be changed.  With no selection, 
the key expiration of the primary key is changed. 
<DT>passwd<DD>
Change the passphrase of the secret key. 
<DT>primary<DD>
Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the primary user 
id flag from all other user ids and sets the timestamp of all affected 
self-signatures one second ahead.  Note that setting a photo user ID 
as primary makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a 
regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other regular user 
IDs. 
<DT>uid <B>n</B><DD>
Toggle selection of user id with index <B>n</B>. 
Use 0 to deselect all. 
<DT>key <B>n</B><DD>
Toggle selection of subkey with index <B>n</B>. 
Use 0 to deselect all. 
<DT>check<DD>
Check all selected user ids. 
<DT>showphoto<DD>
Display the selected photographic user 
id. 
<DT>pref<DD>
List preferences from the selected user ID.  This shows the actual 
preferences, without including any implied preferences. 
<DT>showpref<DD>
More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID.  This shows 
the preferences in effect by including the implied preferences of 
3DES (cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they 
are not already included in the preference list. 
<DT>setpref <B>string</B><DD>
Set the list of user ID preferences to <B>string</B>, this should be a 
string similar to the one printed by &quot;pref&quot;.  Using an empty string 
will set the default preference string, using &quot;none&quot; will set the 
preferences to nil.  Use &quot;gpg -v --version&quot; to get a list of available 
algorithms.  This command just initializes an internal list and does 
not change anything unless another command (such as &quot;updpref&quot;) which 
changes the self-signatures is used. 
<DT>updpref<DD>
Change the preferences of all user IDs (or just of the selected ones 
to the current list of preferences.  The timestamp of all affected 
self-signatures will be advanced by one second.  Note that while you 
can change the preferences on an attribute user ID (aka &quot;photo ID&quot;), 
GnuPG does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences 
will not be used by GnuPG. 
<DT>toggle<DD>
Toggle between public and secret key listing. 
<DT>save<DD>
Save all changes to the key rings and quit. 
<DT>quit<DD>
Quit the program without updating the 
key rings. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The listing shows you the key with its secondary 
keys and all user ids. Selected keys or user ids 
are indicated by an asterisk. The trust value is 
displayed with the primary key: the first is the 
assigned owner trust and the second is the calculated 
trust value.  Letters are used for the values: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-<DD>
No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated. 
<DT>e<DD>
Trust 
calculation has failed; probably due to an expired key. 
<DT>q<DD>
Not enough information for calculation. 
<DT>n<DD>
Never trust this key. 
<DT>m<DD>
Marginally trusted. 
<DT>f<DD>
Fully trusted. 
<DT>u<DD>
Ultimately trusted. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>--sign-key <B>name</B><DD>
Signs a public key with your secret key. This is a shortcut version of 
the subcommand &quot;sign&quot; from --edit. 
<DT>--lsign-key <B>name</B><DD>
Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as 
non-exportable.  This is a shortcut version of the subcommand &quot;lsign&quot; 
from --edit. 
<DT>--nrsign-key <B>name</B><DD>
Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as non-revocable. 
This is a shortcut version of the subcommand &quot;nrsign&quot; from --edit. 
<DT>--delete-key <B>name</B><DD>
Remove key from the public keyring.  In batch mode either --yes is 
required or the key must be specified by fingerprint.  This is a 
safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys. 
<DT>--delete-secret-key <B>name</B><DD>
Remove key from the secret and public keyring. In batch mode the key 
must be specified by fingerprint. 
<DT>--delete-secret-and-public-key <B>name</B><DD>
Same as --delete-key, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed  
first. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. 
<DT>--gen-revoke <B>name</B><DD>
Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key. To revoke 
a subkey or a signature, use the --edit command. 
<DT>--desig-revoke <B>name</B><DD>
Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key.  This allows a 
user (with the permission of the keyholder) to revoke someone else's 
key. 
<DT>--export [<B>names</B>]<DD>
Either export all keys from all keyrings (default 
keyrings and those registered via option --keyring), 
or if at least one name is given, those of the given 
name. The new keyring is written to stdout or to 
the file given with option &quot;output&quot;.  Use together 
with --armor to mail those keys. 
<DT>--send-keys [<B>names</B>]<DD>
Same as --export but sends the keys to a keyserver. 
Option --keyserver must be used to give the name 
of this keyserver. Don't send your complete keyring 
to a keyserver - select only those keys which are new 
or changed by you. 
<DT>--export-secret-keys [<B>names</B>]<DD>
<DT>--export-secret-subkeys [<B>names</B>]<DD>
Same as --export, but exports the secret keys instead. 
This is normally not very useful and a security risk. 
The second form of the command has the special property to 
render the secret part of the primary key useless; this is 
a GNU extension to OpenPGP and other implementations can 
not be expected to successfully import such a key. 
<BR>&nbsp;
See the option --simple-sk-checksum if you want to import such an 
exported key with an older OpenPGP implementation. 
<DT>--import [<B>files</B>]<DD>
<DT>--fast-import [<B>files</B>]<DD>
Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the 
keyring.  The fast version is currently just a synonym. 
<DT><DD>
There are a few other options which control how this command works. 
Most notable here is the --merge-only option which does not insert new keys 
but does only the merging of new signatures, user-IDs and subkeys. 
<DT>--recv-keys <B>key IDs</B><DD>
Import the keys with the given key IDs from a keyserver. Option 
--keyserver must be used to give the name of this keyserver. 
<DT>--refresh-keys [<B>key IDs</B>]<DD>
Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the 
local keyring.  This is useful for updating a key with the latest 
signatures, user IDs, etc.  Calling this with no arguments will 
refresh the entire keyring.  Option --keyserver must be used to give 
the name of this keyserver. 
<DT>--search-keys [<B>names</B>]<DD>
Search the keyserver for the given names.  Multiple names given here 
will be joined together to create the search string for the keyserver. 
Option --keyserver must be used to give the name of this keyserver. 
<DT>--update-trustdb<DD>
Do trust database maintenance.  This command iterates over all keys 
and builds the Web-of-Trust. This is an interactive command because it 
may have to ask for the &quot;ownertrust&quot; values for keys.  The user has to 
give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed 
key to correctly certify (sign) other keys.  GnuPG only asks for the 
ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned to a key.  Using the 
--edit-key menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time. 
<DT>--check-trustdb<DD>
Do trust database maintenance without user interaction.  From time to 
time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or 
signatures and the resulting changes in the Web-of-Trust can be 
tracked.  Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do 
it automatically unless --no-auto-check-trustdb is set.  This command 
can be used to force a trust database check at any time.  The 
processing is identical to that of --update-trustdb but it skips keys 
with a not yet defined &quot;ownertrust&quot;. 
<DT><DD>
For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with --batch 
in which case the trust database check is done only if a check is 
needed.  To force a run even in batch mode add the option --yes. 
<DT>--export-ownertrust<DD>
Send the ownertrust values to stdout.  This is useful for backup 
purposes as these values are the only ones which can't be re-created 
from a corrupted trust DB. 
<DT>--import-ownertrust [<B>files</B>]<DD>
Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored 
in <B>files</B> (or stdin if not given); existing 
values will be overwritten. 
<DT>--rebuild-keydb-caches<DD>
When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used 
to create signature caches in the keyring.  It might be handy in other 
situations too. 
<DT>--print-md <B>algo</B> [<B>files</B>]<DD>
<DT>--print-mds [<B>files</B>]<DD>
Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for all given files or stdin. 
With the second form (or a deprecated &quot;*&quot; as algo) digests for all 
available algorithms are printed. 
<DT>--gen-random <B>0|1|2</B> <TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>   [<B>count</B>]<DD>
Emit COUNT random bytes of the given quality level. If count is not given <BR>
or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted. 
PLEASE, don't use this command unless you know what you are doing; it may 
remove precious entropy from the system! 
<DT>--gen-prime <B>mode</B> <TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>  <B>bits</B> <TT>&nbsp;</TT><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>   [<B>qbits</B>]<DD>
Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is still subject to change. <BR>
<DT>--version<DD>
Print version information along with a list 
of supported algorithms. 
<DT>--warranty<DD>
Print warranty information. 
<DT>-h, --help<DD>
Print usage information.  This is a really long list even though it 
doesn't list all options.  For every option, consult this manual. 
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS </H2>

<P>

Long options can be put in an options file (default 
&quot;~/.gnupg/gpg.conf&quot;).  Short option names will not work - for example, 
&quot;armor&quot; is a valid option for the options file, while &quot;a&quot; is not.  Do 
not write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any 
required arguments.  Lines with a hash ('#') as the first 
non-white-space character are ignored.  Commands may be put in this 
file too, but that is not generally useful as the command will execute 
automatically with every execution of gpg. 
<P>

<B>gpg</B> recognizes these options: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-a, --armor<DD>
Create ASCII armored output. 
<DT>-o, --output <B>file</B><DD>
Write output to <B>file</B>. 
<DT>--max-output <B>n</B><DD>
This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be generated 
when processing a file.  Since OpenPGP supports various levels of 
compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given message may 
be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message.  While 
GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is often a desire to 
set a maximum file size that will be generated before processing is 
forced to stop by the OS limits.  Defaults to 0, which means &quot;no 
limit&quot;. 
<DT>--mangle-dos-filenames<DD>
<DT>--no-mangle-dos-filenames<DD>
The Windows version of GnuPG replaces the extension of an output 
filename to avoid problems with filenames containing more than one 
dot.  This is not necessary for newer Windows versions and so 
--no-mangle-dos-filenames can be used to switch this feature off and 
have GnuPG append the new extension.  This option has no effect on 
non-Windows platforms. 
<DT>-u, --local-user <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as the key to sign with.  Note that this option 
overrides --default-key. 
<DT>--default-key <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as the default key to sign with.  If this option is not 
used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring. 
Note that -u or --local-user overrides this option. 
<DT>-r, --recipient <B>name</B><DD>
<DT><DD>
Encrypt for user id <B>name</B>. If this option is not 
specified, GnuPG asks for the user-id unless --default-recipient is given 
<DT>--default-recipient <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as default recipient if option --recipient is not used and 
don't ask if this is a valid one. <B>name</B> must be non-empty. 
<DT>--default-recipient-self<DD>
Use the default key as default recipient if option --recipient is not used and 
don't ask if this is a valid one. The default key is the first one from the 
secret keyring or the one set with --default-key. 
<DT>--no-default-recipient<DD>
Reset --default-recipient and --default-recipient-self. 
<DT>--encrypt-to <B>name</B><DD>
Same as --recipient but this one is intended for use 
in the options file and may be used with 
your own user-id as an &quot;encrypt-to-self&quot;.  These keys 
are only used when there are other recipients given 
either by use of --recipient or by the asked user id. 
No trust checking is performed for these user ids and 
even disabled keys can be used. 
<DT>--no-encrypt-to<DD>
Disable the use of all --encrypt-to keys. 
<DT>-v, --verbose<DD>
Give more information during processing. If used 
twice, the input data is listed in detail. 
<DT>-q, --quiet<DD>
Try to be as quiet as possible. 
<DT>-z <B>n</B>, --compress-level <B>n</B><DD>
Set compression level to <B>n</B>. A value of 0 for <B>n</B> disables 
compression.  The default is to use the default compression level of 
zlib (normally 6). 
<DT>--bzip2-decompress-lowmem<DD>
Use a different decompression method for BZIP2 compressed files.  This 
alternate method uses a bit more than half the memory, but also runs 
at half the speed.  This is useful under extreme low memory 
circumstances when the file was originally compressed at a very high 
compression level. 
<DT>-t, --textmode<DD>
<DT>--no-textmode<DD>
Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP canonical text 
form with standard &quot;CRLF&quot; line endings.  This also sets the necessary 
flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or signed data is 
text and may need its line endings converted back to whatever the 
local system uses.  This option is useful when communicating between 
two platforms that have different line ending conventions (UNIX-like 
to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc).  --no-textmode disables this option, and 
is the default. 
<DT><DD>
If -t (but not --textmode) is used together with armoring and signing, 
this enables clearsigned messages.  This kludge is needed for 
command-line compatibility with command-line versions of PGP; normally 
you would use --sign or --clearsign to select the type of the 
signature. 
<DT>-n, --dry-run<DD>
Don't make any changes (this is not completely implemented). 
<DT>-i, --interactive<DD>
Prompt before overwriting any files. 
<DT>--batch<DD>
<DT>--no-batch<DD>
Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow interactive commands. 
--no-batch disables this option. 
<DT>--no-tty<DD>
Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any output. 
This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG sometimes prints 
warnings to the TTY if --batch is used. 
<DT>--yes<DD>
Assume &quot;yes&quot; on most questions. 
<DT>--no<DD>
Assume &quot;no&quot; on most questions. 
<DT>--ask-cert-level<DD>
<DT>--no-ask-cert-level<DD>
When making a key signature, prompt for a certification level.  If 
this option is not specified, the certification level used is set via 
--default-cert-level.  See --default-cert-level for information on the 
specific levels and how they are used. --no-ask-cert-level disables 
this option.  This option defaults to yes. 
<DT>--min-cert-level<DD>
When building the trust database, disregard any signatures with a 
certification level below this.  Defaults to 1, which accepts all 
signatures. 
<DT>--default-cert-level <B>n</B><DD>
The default to use for the check level when signing a key. 
<DT><DD>
0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified 
the key. 
<DT><DD>
1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own 
it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all.  This is 
useful for a &quot;persona&quot; verification, where you sign the key of a 
pseudonymous user. 
<DT><DD>
2 means you did casual verification of the key.  For example, this 
could mean that you verified that the key fingerprint and checked the 
user ID on the key against a photo ID. 
<DT><DD>
3 means you did extensive verification of the key.  For example, this 
could mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the 
key in person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge 
document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key 
owner matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you 
verified (by exchange of email) that the email address on the key 
belongs to the key owner. 
<DT><DD>
Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that: 
examples.  In the end, it is up to you to decide just what &quot;casual&quot; 
and &quot;extensive&quot; mean to you. 
<DT><DD>
This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim). 
<DT>--trusted-key <B>long key ID</B><DD>
Assume that the specified key (which must be given 
as a  full 8 byte key ID) is as trustworthy as one of 
your own secret keys. This option is useful if you 
don't want to keep your secret keys (or one of them) 
online but still want to be able to check the validity of a given 
recipient's or signator's key.  
<DT>--trust-model <B>classic|always</B><DD>
Set what trust model GnuPG should follow.  The models are: 
<BR>&nbsp;
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>classic<DD>
This is the regular web-of-trust as used in PGP and GnuPG. 
<DT>always<DD>
Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully 
trusted.  You won't use this unless you have installed some external 
validation scheme.  This option also suppresses the &quot;[uncertain]&quot; tag 
printed with signature checks when there is no evidence that the user 
ID is bound to the key. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>--always-trust<DD>
Identical to `--trust-model always'.  This option is deprecated. 
<DT>--keyserver <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as your keyserver.  This is the server that 
--recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will communicate with to 
receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.  The format 
of the <B>name</B> is a URI: `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]' The 
scheme is the type of keyserver: &quot;hkp&quot; for the HTTP (or compatible) 
keyservers, &quot;ldap&quot; for the NAI LDAP keyserver, or &quot;mailto&quot; for the 
Graff email keyserver.  Note that your particular installation of 
GnuPG may have other keyserver types available as well.  Keyserver 
schemes are case-insensitive. 
<DT><DD>
Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no 
need to send keys to more than one server.  The keyserver 
&quot;<A HREF="hkp://subkeys.pgp.net">hkp://subkeys.pgp.net</A>&quot; uses round robin DNS to give a different 
keyserver each time you use it. 
<DT>--keyserver-options <B>parameters</B><DD>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for the 
keyserver.  Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the opposite 
meaning.  Valid import-options or export-options may be used here as 
well to apply to importing (--recv-key) or exporting (--send-key) a 
key from a keyserver.  While not all options are available for all 
keyserver types, some common options are: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>include-revoked<DD>
When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are 
marked on the keyserver as revoked.  Note that not all keyservers 
differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such 
keyservers this option is meaningless.  Note also that most keyservers 
do not have cryptographic verification of key revocations, and so 
turning this option off may result in skipping keys that are 
incorrectly marked as revoked.  Defaults to on. 
<DT>include-disabled<DD>
When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are 
marked on the keyserver as disabled.  Note that this option is not 
used with HKP keyservers. 
<DT>include-subkeys<DD>
When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets.  Note that 
this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as they do not support 
retrieving keys by subkey id. 
<DT>use-temp-files<DD>
On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG communicates with the keyserver 
helper program via pipes, which is the most efficient method.  This 
option forces GnuPG to use temporary files to communicate.  On some 
platforms (such as Win32 and RISC OS), this option is always enabled. 
<DT>keep-temp-files<DD>
If using `use-temp-files', do not delete the temp files after using 
them.  This option is useful to learn the keyserver communication 
protocol by reading the temporary files. 
<DT>verbose<DD>
Tell the keyserver helper program to be more verbose.  This option can 
be repeated multiple times to increase the verbosity level. 
<DT>honor-http-proxy<DD>
For keyserver schemes that use HTTP (such as HKP), try to access the 
keyserver over the proxy set with the environment variable 
&quot;http_proxy&quot;. 
<DT>auto-key-retrieve<DD>
This option enables the automatic retrieving of keys from a keyserver 
when verifying signatures made by keys that are not on the local 
keyring. 
<DT><DD>
Note that this option makes a &quot;web bug&quot; like behavior possible. 
Keyserver operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you 
a message signed by a brand new key (which you naturally will not have 
on your local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and 
the time when you verified the signature. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>--import-options <B>parameters</B><DD>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for 
importing keys.  Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the 
opposite meaning.  The options are: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>allow-local-sigs<DD>
Allow importing key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;.  This is not 
generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being used. 
Defaults to no. 
<DT>repair-pks-subkey-bug<DD>
During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the PKS 
keyserver bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple 
subkeys.  Note that this cannot completely repair the damaged key as 
some crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at least 
give you back one subkey.  Defaults to no for regular --import and to 
yes for keyserver --recv-keys. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>--export-options <B>parameters</B><DD>
This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for 
exporting keys.  Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the 
opposite meaning.  The options are: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>include-non-rfc<DD>
Include non-RFC compliant keys in the export.  Defaults to yes. 
<DT>include-local-sigs<DD>
Allow exporting key signatures marked as &quot;local&quot;.  This is not 
generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being used. 
Defaults to no. 
<DT>include-attributes<DD>
Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while exporting.  This is 
useful to export keys if they are going to be used by an OpenPGP 
program that does not accept attribute user IDs.  Defaults to yes. 
<DT>include-sensitive-revkeys<DD>
Include designated revoker information that was marked as 
&quot;sensitive&quot;.  Defaults to no. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>--show-photos<DD>
<DT>--no-show-photos<DD>
Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs, --list-public-keys, 
--list-secret-keys, and verifying a signature to also display the 
photo ID attached to the key, if any.  See also --photo-viewer. 
--no-show-photos disables this option. 
<DT>--photo-viewer <B>string</B><DD>
This is the command line that should be run to view a photo ID.  &quot;%i&quot; 
will be expanded to a filename containing the photo.  &quot;%I&quot; does the 
same, except the file will not be deleted once the viewer exits. 
Other flags are &quot;%k&quot; for the key ID, &quot;%K&quot; for the long key ID, &quot;%f&quot; 
for the key fingerprint, &quot;%t&quot; for the extension of the image type 
(e.g. &quot;jpg&quot;), &quot;%T&quot; for the MIME type of the image (e.g. &quot;image/jpeg&quot;), 
and &quot;%%&quot; for an actual percent sign.  If neither %i or %I are present, 
then the photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard input. 
<DT><DD>
The default viewer is &quot;xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k' 
stdin&quot;.  Note that if your image viewer program is not secure, then 
executing it from GnuPG does not make it secure. 
<DT>--exec-path <B>string</B><DD>
Sets a list of directories to search for photo viewers and keyserver 
helpers.  If not provided, keyserver helpers use the compiled-in 
default directory, and photo viewers use the $PATH environment 
variable. 
<DT>--show-keyring<DD>
Causes --list-keys, --list-public-keys, and --list-secret-keys to 
display the name of the keyring a given key resides on. This is only 
useful when you're listing a specific key or set of keys. It has no 
effect when listing all keys. 
<DT>--keyring <B>file</B><DD>
Add <B>file</B> to the current list of keyrings.  If <B>file</B> begins 
with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME 
directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to 
be in the GnuPG home directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME 
is not used). 
<DT><DD>
Note that this adds a keyring to the current list.  If the intent is 
to use the specified keyring alone, use --keyring along with 
--no-default-keyring. 
<DT>--secret-keyring <B>file</B><DD>
Same as --keyring but for the secret keyrings. 
<DT>--trustdb-name <B>file</B><DD>
Use <B>file</B> instead of the default trustdb.  If <B>file</B> begins 
with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME 
directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to 
be in the GnuPG home directory (&quot;~/.gnupg&quot; if --homedir or $GNUPGHOME 
is not used). 
<DT>--homedir <B>directory</B><DD>
Set the name of the home directory to <B>directory</B> If this option is not 
used it defaults to &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;. It does not make sense to use this in 
a options file. This also overrides the environment variable 
$GNUPGHOME. 
<DT>--display-charset <B>name</B><DD>
Set the name of the native character set.  This is used to convert 
some informational strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 
encoding. If this option is not used, the default character set is 
determined from the current locale.  A verbosity level of 3 shows the 
chosen set.  Valid values for <B>name</B> are: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>iso-8859-1<DD>
This is the Latin 1 set. 
<DT>iso-8859-2<DD>
The Latin 2 set. 
<DT>iso-8859-15<DD>
This is currently an alias for 
the Latin 1 set. 
<DT>koi8-r<DD>
The usual Russian set (rfc1489). 
<DT>utf-8<DD>
Bypass all translations and assume 
that the OS uses native UTF-8 encoding. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>--utf8-strings<DD>
<DT>--no-utf8-strings<DD>
Assume that command line arguments are given as UTF8 strings.  The 
default (--no-utf8-strings) is to assume that arguments are encoded in 
the character set as specified by --display-charset. These options 
affect all following arguments.  Both options may be used multiple 
times. 
<DT>--options <B>file</B><DD>
Read options from <B>file</B> and do not try to read 
them from the default options file in the homedir 
(see --homedir). This option is ignored if used 
in an options file. 
<DT>--no-options<DD>
Shortcut for &quot;--options /dev/null&quot;.  This option is 
detected before an attempt to open an option file. 
Using this option will also prevent the creation of a  
&quot;~./gnupg&quot; homedir. 
<DT>--load-extension <B>name</B><DD>
Load an extension module. If <B>name</B> does not contain a slash it is 
searched for in the directory configured when GnuPG was built 
(generally &quot;/usr/local/lib/gnupg&quot;).  Extensions are not generally 
useful anymore, and the use of this option is deprecated. 
<DT>--debug <B>flags</B><DD>
Set debugging flags. All flags are or-ed and <B>flags</B> may 
be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042). 
<DT>--debug-all<DD>
Set all useful debugging flags. 
<DT>--enable-progress-filter<DD>
Enable certain PROGRESS status outputs.  This option allows frontends 
to display a progress indicator while gpg is processing larger files. 
There is a slight performance overhead using it. 
<DT>--status-fd <B>n</B><DD>
Write special status strings to the file descriptor <B>n</B>. 
See the file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of them. 
<DT>--logger-fd <B>n</B><DD>
Write log output to file descriptor <B>n</B> and not to stderr. 
<DT>--attribute-fd <B>n</B><DD>
Write attribute subpackets to the file descriptor <B>n</B>.  This is 
most useful for use with --status-fd, since the status messages are 
needed to separate out the various subpackets from the stream 
delivered to the file descriptor. 
<DT>--sk-comments<DD>
<DT>--no-sk-comments<DD>
Include secret key comment packets when exporting secret keys.  This 
is a GnuPG extension to the OpenPGP standard, and is off by default. 
Please note that this has nothing to do with the comments in clear 
text signatures or armor headers.  --no-sk-comments disables this 
option. 
<DT>--no-comment<DD>
See --no-sk-comments.  This option is deprecated and may be removed 
soon. 
<DT>--comment <B>string</B><DD>
Use <B>string</B> as the comment string in ASCII armored or clearsigned 
messages.  The default behavior is to not use a comment string. 
<DT>--default-comment<DD>
Force to write the standard comment string in clear 
text signatures.  Use this to overwrite a --comment 
from a config file.  This option is now obsolete because there is no 
default comment string anymore. 
<DT>--emit-version<DD>
<DT>--no-emit-version<DD>
Force inclusion of the version string in ASCII armored output. 
--no-emit-version disables this option. 
<DT>--sig-notation <B>name=value</B><DD>
<DT>--cert-notation <B>name=value</B><DD>
<DT>-N, --set-notation <B>name=value</B><DD>
Put the name value pair into the signature as notation data. 
<B>name</B> must consist only of printable characters or spaces, and 
must contain a '@' character.  This is to help prevent pollution of 
the IETF reserved notation namespace.  The --expert flag overrides the 

encoded in UTF8, so you should check that your --display-charset is 
set correctly.  If you prefix <B>name</B> with an exclamation mark (!), 
the notation data will be flagged as critical (rfc2440:5.2.3.15). 
--sig-notation sets a notation for data signatures.  --cert-notation 
sets a notation for key signatures (certifications).  --set-notation 
sets both. 
<DT><DD>
There are special codes that may be used in notation names.  &quot;%k&quot; will 
be expanded into the key ID of the key being signed, &quot;%K&quot; into the 
long key ID of the key being signed, &quot;%f&quot; into the fingerprint of the 
key being signed, &quot;%s&quot; into the key ID of the key making the 
signature, &quot;%S&quot; into the long key ID of the key making the signature, 
&quot;%g&quot; into the fingerprint of the key making the signature (which might 
be a subkey), &quot;%p&quot; into the fingerprint of the primary key of the key 
making the signature, and &quot;%%&quot; results in a single &quot;%&quot;.  %k, %K, and 
%f are only meaningful when making a key signature (certification). 
<DT>--show-notation<DD>
<DT>--no-show-notation<DD>
Show signature notations in the --list-sigs or --check-sigs listings 
as well as when verifying a signature with a notation in it. 
--no-show-notation disables this option. 
<DT>--sig-policy-url <B>string</B><DD>
<DT>--cert-policy-url <B>string</B><DD>
<DT>--set-policy-url <B>string</B><DD>
Use <B>string</B> as a Policy URL for signatures (rfc2440:5.2.3.19). 
If you prefix it with an exclamation mark (!), the policy URL packet 
will be flagged as critical.  --sig-policy-url sets a policy url for 
data signatures.  --cert-policy-url sets a policy url for key 
signatures (certifications).  --set-policy-url sets both. 
<DT><DD>
The same %-expandos used for notation data are available here as well. 
<DT>--show-policy-url<DD>
<DT>--no-show-policy-url<DD>
Show policy URLs in the --list-sigs or --check-sigs listings as well 
as when verifying a signature with a policy URL in it. 
--no-show-policy-url disables this option. 
<DT>--set-filename <B>string</B><DD>
Use <B>string</B> as the filename which is stored inside messages. 
This overrides the default, which is to use the actual filename of the 
file being encrypted. 
<DT>--for-your-eyes-only<DD>
<DT>--no-for-your-eyes-only<DD>
Set the `for your eyes only' flag in the message.  This causes GnuPG 
to refuse to save the file unless the --output option is given, and 
PGP to use the &quot;secure viewer&quot; with a Tempest-resistant font to 
display the message.  This option overrides --set-filename. 
--no-for-your-eyes-only disables this option. 
<DT>--use-embedded-filename<DD>
<DT>--no-use-embedded-filename<DD>
Try to create a file with a name as embedded in the data.  This can be 
a dangerous option as it allows to overwrite files.  Defaults to no. 
<DT>--completes-needed <B>n</B><DD>
Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new 
key signer (defaults to 1). 
<DT>--marginals-needed <B>n</B><DD>
Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new 
key signer (defaults to 3) 
<DT>--max-cert-depth <B>n</B><DD>
Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5). 
<DT>--cipher-algo <B>name</B><DD>
Use  <B>name</B> as cipher algorithm. Running the program 
with the command --version yields a list of supported 
algorithms. If this is not used the cipher algorithm is 
selected from the preferences stored with the key. 
<DT>--digest-algo <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as the message digest algorithm. Running the program 
with the command --version yields a list of supported algorithms. 
<DT>--cert-digest-algo <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as the message digest algorithm used when signing a 
key.  Running the program with the command --version yields a list of 
supported algorithms.  Be aware that if you choose an algorithm that 
GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then some 
users will not be able to use the key signatures you make, or quite 
possibly your entire key. 
<DT>--s2k-cipher-algo <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as the cipher algorithm used to protect secret keys. 
The default cipher is CAST5.  This cipher is also used for 
conventional encryption if --cipher-algo is not given. 
<DT>--s2k-digest-algo <B>name</B><DD>
Use <B>name</B> as the digest algorithm used to mangle the passphrases. 
The default algorithm is SHA-1.  This digest algorithm is also used 
for conventional encryption if --digest-algo is not given. 
<DT>--s2k-mode <B>n</B><DD>
Selects how passphrases are mangled. If <B>n</B> is 0 a plain 
passphrase (which is not recommended) will be used, a 1 adds a salt to 
the passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a 
couple of times.  Unless --rfc1991 is used, this mode is also used for 
conventional encryption. 
<DT>--simple-sk-checksum<DD>
Secret keys are integrity protected by using a SHA-1 checksum.  This 
method is part of the upcoming enhanced OpenPGP specification but 
GnuPG already uses it as a countermeasure against certain attacks. 
Old applications don't understand this new format, so this option may 
be used to switch back to the old behaviour.  Using this option bears 
a security risk.  Note that using this option only takes effect when 
the secret key is encrypted - the simplest way to make this happen is 
to change the passphrase on the key (even changing it to the same 
value is acceptable). 
<DT>--compress-algo <B>n</B><DD>
Use compression algorithm <B>n</B>.  The value 2 is RFC1950 ZLIB 
compression.  The value 1 is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by 
PGP.  0 disables compression.  If this option is not used, the default 
behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences to see which 
algorithms the recipient supports.  If all else fails, ZIP is used for 
maximum compatibility.  Note, however, that ZLIB may give better 
compression results if that is more important, as the compression 
window size is not limited to 8k. 
<DT>--disable-cipher-algo <B>name</B><DD>
Never allow the use of <B>name</B> as cipher algorithm. 
The given name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm 
will still get disabled. 
<DT>--disable-pubkey-algo <B>name</B><DD>
Never allow the use of <B>name</B> as public key algorithm. 
The given name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm 
will still get disabled. 
<DT>--no-sig-cache<DD>
Do not cache the verification status of key signatures. 
Caching gives a much better performance in key listings.  However, if 
you suspect that your public keyring is not save against write 
modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching.  It 
probably does not make sense to disable it because all kind of damage 
can be done if someone else has write access to your public keyring. 
<DT>--no-sig-create-check<DD>
GnuPG normally verifies each signature right after creation to protect 
against bugs and hardware malfunctions which could leak out bits from 
the secret key.  This extra verification needs some time (about 115% 
for DSA keys), and so this option can be used to disable it. 
However, due to the fact that the signature creation needs manual 
interaction, this performance penalty does not matter in most settings. 
<DT>--auto-check-trustdb<DD>
<DT>--no-auto-check-trustdb<DD>
If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web-of-Trust has to be 
updated, it automatically runs the --check-trustdb command internally. 
This may be a time consuming process.  --no-auto-check-trustdb 
disables this option. 
<DT>--throw-keyids<DD>
Do not put the recipient keyid into encrypted packets.  This option 
hides the receiver of the message and is a countermeasure against 
traffic analysis.  It may slow down the decryption process because all 
available secret keys are tried. 
<DT>--not-dash-escaped<DD>
This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures 
so that they can be used for patch files. You should not 
send such an armored file via email because all spaces 
and line endings are hashed too.  You can not use this 
option for data which has 5 dashes at the beginning of a 
line, patch files don't have this. A special armor header 
line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature option. 
<DT>--escape-from-lines<DD>
<DT>--no-escape-from-lines<DD>
Because some mailers change lines starting with &quot;From &quot; to &quot;&gt;From 
&quot; it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating 
cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from breaking the 
signature.  Note that all other PGP versions do it this way too. 
Enabled by default.  --no-escape-from-lines disables this option. 
<DT>--passphrase-fd <B>n</B><DD>
Read the passphrase from file descriptor <B>n</B>. If you use 
0 for <B>n</B>, the passphrase will be read from stdin.<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>This <BR>
can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied. 
Don't use this option if you can avoid it. 
<DT>--command-fd <B>n</B><DD>
This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC mode. 
If this option is enabled, user input on questions is not expected 
from the TTY but from the given file descriptor.  It should be used 
together with --status-fd. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source 
distribution for details on how to use it. 
<DT>--use-agent<DD>
<DT>--no-use-agent<DD>
Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. Please note that this agent is still under 
development.  With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to the 
agent before it asks for a passphrase.  --no-use-agent disables this 
option. 
<DT>--gpg-agent-info<DD>
Override the value of the environment variable 
<B>GPG_AGENT_INFO</B>.  This is only used when --use-agent has been given 
<DT>Compliance options<DD>
These options control what GnuPG is compliant to.  Only one of these 
options may be active at a time.  Note that the default setting of 
this is nearly always the correct one.  See the INTEROPERABILITY WITH 
OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below before using one of these 
options. 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--gnupg<DD>
Use standard GnuPG behavior.  This is essentially OpenPGP behavior 
(see --openpgp), but with some additional workarounds for common 
compatibility problems in different versions of PGP.  This is the 
default option, so it is not generally needed, but it may be useful to 
override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf file. 
<DT>--openpgp<DD>
Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict OpenPGP 
behavior.  Use this option to reset all previous options like 
--rfc1991, --force-v3-sigs, --s2k-*, --cipher-algo, --digest-algo and 
--compress-algo to OpenPGP compliant values.  All PGP workarounds are 
disabled. 
<DT>--rfc2440<DD>
Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-2440 
behavior.  Note that this is currently the same thing as --openpgp. 
<DT>--rfc1991<DD>
Try to be more RFC-1991 (PGP 2.x) compliant. 
<DT>--pgp2<DD>
Set up all options to be as PGP 2.x compliant as possible, and warn if 
an action is taken (e.g. encrypting to a non-RSA key) that will create 
a message that PGP 2.x will not be able to handle.  Note that `PGP 
2.x' here means `MIT PGP 2.6.2'.  There are other versions of PGP 2.x 
available, but the MIT release is a good common baseline. 
<DT><DD>
This option implies `--rfc1991 --disable-mdc --no-force-v4-certs 
--no-sk-comment --escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs 
--no-ask-sig-expire --no-ask-cert-expire --cipher-algo IDEA 
--digest-algo MD5 --compress-algo 1'.  It also disables --textmode 
when encrypting. 
<DT>--pgp6<DD>
Set up all options to be as PGP 6 compliant as possible.  This 
restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the IDEA plugin is installed), 
3DES, and CAST5, the hashes MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the 
compression algorithms none and ZIP.  This also disables 
--throw-keyids, and making signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6 
does not understand signatures made by signing subkeys. 
<DT><DD>
This option implies `--disable-mdc --no-sk-comment --escape-from-lines 
--force-v3-sigs --no-ask-sig-expire' 
<DT>--pgp7<DD>
Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible.  This is 
identical to --pgp6 except that MDCs are not disabled, and the list of 
allowable ciphers is expanded to add AES128, AES192, AES256, and 
TWOFISH. 
<DT>--pgp8<DD>
Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as possible.  PGP 8 is a 
lot closer to the OpenPGP standard than previous versions of PGP, so 
all this does is disable --throw-keyids and set --escape-from-lines. 
All algorithms are allowed except for the SHA384 and SHA512 digests. 
</DL>
</DL>

<DT>--force-v3-sigs<DD>
<DT>--no-force-v3-sigs<DD>
OpenPGP states that an implementation should generate v4 signatures 
but PGP versions 5 through 7 only recognize v4 signatures on key 
material.  This option forces v3 signatures for signatures on data. 
Note that this option overrides --ask-sig-expire, as v3 signatures 
cannot have expiration dates.  --no-force-v3-sigs disables this 
option. 
<DT>--force-v4-certs<DD>
<DT>--no-force-v4-certs<DD>
Always use v4 key signatures even on v3 keys.  This option also 
changes the default hash algorithm for v3 RSA keys from MD5 to SHA-1. 
--no-force-v4-certs disables this option. 
<DT>--force-mdc<DD>
Force the use of encryption with a modification detection code.  This 
is always used with the newer ciphers (those with a blocksize greater 
than 64 bits), or if all of the recipient keys indicate MDC support in 
their feature flags. 
<DT>--disable-mdc<DD>
Disable the use of the modification detection code.  Note that by 
using this option, the encrypted message becomes vulnerable to a 
message modification attack. 
<DT>--allow-non-selfsigned-uid<DD>
<DT>--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid<DD>
Allow the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not 
self-signed.  This is not recommended, as a non self-signed user ID is 
trivial to forge.  --no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid disables. 
<DT>--allow-freeform-uid<DD>
Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while generating a new 
one.  This option should only be used in very special environments as 
it does not ensure the de-facto standard format of user IDs. 
<DT>--ignore-time-conflict<DD>
GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and 
signatures have plausible values.  However, sometimes a signature 
seems to be older than the key due to clock problems.  This option 
makes these checks just a warning.  See also --ignore-valid-from for 
timestamp issues on subkeys. 
<DT>--ignore-valid-from<DD>
GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the future. 
This option allows the use of such keys and thus exhibits the 
pre-1.0.7 behaviour.  You should not use this option unless you there 
is some clock problem.  See also --ignore-time-conflict for timestamp 
issues with signatures. 
<DT>--ignore-crc-error<DD>
The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum against 
transmission errors.  Sometimes it happens that the CRC gets mangled 
somewhere on the transmission channel but the actual content (which is 
protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay.  This option 
will let gpg ignore CRC errors. 
<DT>--ignore-mdc-error<DD>
This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a warning. 
This can be useful if a message is partially corrupt, but it is 
necessary to get as much data as possible out of the corrupt message. 
However, be aware that a MDC protection failure may also mean that the 
message was tampered with intentionally by an attacker. 
<DT>--lock-once<DD>
Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested 
and do not release the lock until the process 
terminates. 
<DT>--lock-multiple<DD>
Release the locks every time a lock is no longer 
needed. Use this to override a previous --lock-once 
from a config file. 
<DT>--lock-never<DD>
Disable locking entirely.  This option should be used only in very 
special environments, where it can be assured that only one process 
is accessing those files.  A bootable floppy with a stand-alone 
encryption system will probably use this.  Improper usage of this 
option may lead to data and key corruption. 
<DT>--no-random-seed-file<DD>
GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over invocations. 
This makes random generation faster; however sometimes write operations 
are not desired.  This option can be used to achieve that with the cost of 
slower random generation. 
<DT>--no-verbose<DD>
Reset verbose level to 0. 
<DT>--no-greeting<DD>
Suppress the initial copyright message. 
<DT>--no-secmem-warning<DD>
Suppress the warning about &quot;using insecure memory&quot;. 
<DT>--no-permission-warning<DD>
Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory (--homedir) 
permissions.  Note that the permission checks that GnuPG performs are 
not intended to be authoritative, but rather they simply warn about 
certain common permission problems.  Do not assume that the lack of a 
warning means that your system is secure. 
<DT><DD>
Note that the warning for unsafe --homedir permissions cannot be 
supressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker to 
place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file to supress 
warnings about itself.  The --homedir permissions warning may only be 
supressed on the command line. 
<DT>--no-mdc-warning<DD>
Suppress the warning about missing MDC integrity protection. 
<DT>--no-armor<DD>
Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored format. 
<DT>--no-default-keyring<DD>
Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings.  Note that 
GnuPG will not operate without any keyrings, so if you use this option 
and do not provide alternate keyrings via --keyring or 
--secret-keyring, then GnuPG will still use the default public or 
secret keyrings. 
<DT>--skip-verify<DD>
Skip the signature verification step.  This may be 
used to make the decryption faster if the signature 
verification is not needed. 
<DT>--with-colons<DD>
Print key listings delimited by colons.  Note that the output will be 
encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any --display-charset setting.  This 
format is useful when GnuPG is called from scripts and other programs 
as it is easily machine parsed.  The details of this format are 
documented in the file doc/DETAILS, which is included in the GnuPG 
source distribution. 
<DT>--with-key-data<DD>
Print key listings delimited by colons (like --with-colons) and print the public key data. 
<DT>--with-fingerprint<DD>
Same as the command --fingerprint but changes only the format of the output 
and may be used together with another command. 
<DT>--fast-list-mode<DD>
Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this is achieved 
by leaving some parts empty.  Some applications don't need the user ID and 
the trust information given in the listings.  By using this options they 
can get a faster listing.  The exact behaviour of this option may change 
in future versions. 
<DT>--fixed-list-mode<DD>
Do not merge primary user ID and primary key in --with-colon listing 
mode and print all timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01. 
<DT>--list-only<DD>
Changes the behaviour of some commands.  This is like --dry-run but 
different in some cases.  The semantic of this command may be extended in 
the future.  Currently it only skips the actual decryption pass and 
therefore enables a fast listing of the encryption keys. 
<DT>--no-literal<DD>
This is not for normal use.  Use the source to see for what it might be useful. 
<DT>--set-filesize<DD>
This is not for normal use.  Use the source to see for what it might be useful. 
<DT>--emulate-md-encode-bug<DD>
GnuPG versions prior to 1.0.2 had a bug in the way a signature was 
encoded.  This options enables a workaround by checking faulty 
signatures again with the encoding used in old versions.  This may 
only happen for Elgamal signatures which are not widely used. 
<DT>--show-session-key<DD>
Display the session key used for one message. See --override-session-key 
for the counterpart of this option. 
<DT><DD>
We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should have 
the freedom to decide whether to go to prison or to reveal the content 
of one specific message without compromising all messages ever 
encrypted for one secret key. DON'T USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY 
FORCED TO DO SO. 
<DT>--override-session-key <B>string</B> <DD>
Don't use the public key but the session key <B>string</B>.  The format of this 
string is the same as the one printed by --show-session-key.  This option 
is normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal the 
content of an encrypted message; using this option you can do this without 
handing out the secret key. 
<DT>--ask-sig-expire<DD>
<DT>--no-ask-sig-expire<DD>
When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration time.  If this 
option is not specified, the expiration time is &quot;never&quot;. 
--no-ask-sig-expire disables this option. 
<DT>--ask-cert-expire<DD>
<DT>--no-ask-cert-expire<DD>
When making a key signature, prompt for an expiration time.  If this 
option is not specified, the expiration time is &quot;never&quot;. 
--no-ask-cert-expire disables this option. 
<DT>--expert<DD>
<DT>--no-expert<DD>
Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or &quot;silly&quot; things like 
signing an expired or revoked key, or certain potentially incompatible 
things like generating deprecated key types.  This also disables 
certain warning messages about potentially incompatible actions.  As 
the name implies, this option is for experts only.  If you don't fully 
understand the implications of what it allows you to do, leave this 
off.  --no-expert disables this option. 
<DT>--merge-only<DD>
Don't insert new keys into the keyrings while doing an import. 
<DT>--allow-secret-key-import<DD>
This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere. 
<DT>--try-all-secrets<DD>
Don't look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all secret 
keys in turn to find the right decryption key. This option forces the 
behaviour as used by anonymous recipients (created by using 
--throw-keyids) and might come handy in case where an encrypted 
message contains a bogus key ID. 
<DT>--enable-special-filenames<DD>
This options enables a mode in which filenames of the form 
<B>-&amp;n</B>, where n is a non-negative decimal number, 
refer to the file descriptor n and not to a file with that name. 
<DT>--no-expensive-trust-checks<DD>
Experimental use only. 
<DT>--group <B>name=value1 [value2 value3 ...]</B><DD>
Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases in email programs. 
Any time the group name is a recipient (-r or --recipient), it will be 
expanded to the values specified.  Multiple groups with the same name 
are automatically merged into a single group. 
<DT><DD>
The values are <B>key IDs</B> or fingerprints, but any key description 
is accepted.  Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated as 
two different values.  Note also there is only one level of expansion 
- you cannot make an group that points to another group.  When used 
from the command line, it may be necessary to quote the argument to 
this option to prevent the shell from treating it as multiple 
arguments. 
<DT>--ungroup <B>name</B><DD>
Remove a given entry from the --group list. 
<DT>--no-groups<DD>
Remove all entries from the --group list. 
<DT>--preserve-permissions<DD>
Don't change the permissions of a secret keyring back to user 
read/write only.  Use this option only if you really know what you are doing. 
<DT>--personal-cipher-preferences <B>string</B><DD>
Set the list of personal cipher preferences to <B>string</B>, this list 
should be a string similar to the one printed by the command &quot;pref&quot; in 
the edit menu.  This allows the user to factor in their own preferred 
algorithms when algorithms are chosen via recipient key preferences. 
<DT>--personal-digest-preferences <B>string</B><DD>
Set the list of personal digest preferences to <B>string</B>, this list 
should be a string similar to the one printed by the command &quot;pref&quot; in 
the edit menu.  This allows the user to factor in their own preferred 
algorithms when algorithms are chosen via recipient key preferences. 
The default value is &quot;H2&quot; indicating SHA-1. 
<DT>--personal-compress-preferences <B>string</B><DD>
Set the list of personal compression preferences to <B>string</B>, this 
list should be a string similar to the one printed by the command 
&quot;pref&quot; in the edit menu.  This allows the user to factor in their own 
preferred algorithms when algorithms are chosen via recipient key 
preferences. 
<DT>--default-preference-list <B>string</B><DD>
Set the list of default preferences to <B>string</B>, this list should 
be a string similar to the one printed by the command &quot;pref&quot; in the 
edit menu.  This affects both key generation and &quot;updpref&quot; in the edit 
menu. 
<DT>--list-config [<B>names</B>]<DD>
Display various internal configuration parameters of GnuPG.  This 
option is intended for external programs that call GnuPG to perform 
tasks, and is thus not generally useful.  See the file 
<B>doc/DETAILS</B> in the source distribution for the 
details of which configuration items may be listed.  --list-config is 
only usable with --with-colons set.

<H2>How to specify a user ID </H2>

<P>

There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG; here are some 
examples: 
<BR>&nbsp;
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<DT>234567C4<DD>
<DT>0F34E556E<DD>
<DT>01347A56A<DD>
<DT>0xAB123456<DD>
Here the key ID is given in the usual short form. 
<DT>234AABBCC34567C4<DD>
<DT>0F323456784E56EAB<DD>
<DT>01AB3FED1347A5612<DD>
<DT>0x234AABBCC34567C4<DD>
Here the key ID is given in the long form as used by OpenPGP 
(you can get the long key ID using the option --with-colons). 
<DT>1234343434343434C434343434343434<DD>
<DT>123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434<DD>
<DT>0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434<DD>
<DT>0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434<DD>
The best way to specify a key ID is by using the fingerprint of 
the key.  This avoids any ambiguities in case that there are duplicated 
key IDs (which are really rare for the long key IDs). 
<DT>=Heinrich Heine &lt;<A HREF="mailto:heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de">heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de</A>&gt;<DD>
Using an exact to match string.  The equal sign indicates this. 
<DT>&lt;<A HREF="mailto:heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de">heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de</A>&gt;<DD>
Using the email address part which must match exactly.<TT>&nbsp;</TT>The left angle bracket <BR>
indicates this email address mode. 
<DT>+Heinrich Heine duesseldorf<DD>
All words must match exactly (not case sensitive) but can appear in 
any order in the user ID.  Words are any sequences of letters, 
digits, the underscore and all characters with bit 7 set. 
<DT>Heine<DD>
<DT>*Heine<DD>
By case insensitive substring matching.  This is the default mode but 
applications may want to explicitly indicate this by putting the asterisk 
in front. 
</DL>
<P>

Note that you can append an exclamation mark (!) to key IDs or 
fingerprints.  This flag tells GnuPG to use the specified primary or 
secondary key and not to try and calculate which primary or secondary 
key to use. 
<BR>&nbsp;
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE </H2>

<P>

The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least 
a signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors. 
<BR>&nbsp;
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES </H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>gpg -se -r <B>Bob</B> <B>file</B><DD>
sign and encrypt for user Bob 
<DT>gpg --clearsign <B>file</B><DD>
make a clear text signature 
<DT>gpg -sb  <B>file</B><DD>
make a detached signature 
<DT>gpg --list-keys  <B>user_ID</B><DD>

show fingerprint 
<DT>gpg --verify  <B>pgpfile</B><DD>
<DT>gpg --verify  <B>sigfile</B> [<B>files</B>]<DD>
Verify the signature of the file but do not output the data. The 
second form is used for detached signatures, where <B>sigfile</B> is the detached signature (either ASCII armored or binary) and 
[<B>files</B>] are the signed data; if this is not given, the name of 
the file holding the signed data is constructed by cutting off the 
extension (&quot;.asc&quot; or &quot;.sig&quot;) of <B>sigfile</B> or by asking the 
user for the filename. 
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT </H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>HOME<DD>
Used to locate the default home directory. 
<DT>GNUPGHOME<DD>
If set directory used instead of &quot;~/.gnupg&quot;. 
<DT>GPG_AGENT_INFO<DD>
Used to locate the gpg-agent; only honored when 
--use-agent is set.  The value consists of 3 colon delimited fields:  
The first is the path to the Unix Domain Socket, the second the PID of 
the gpg-agent and the protocol version which should be set to 1.  When 
starting the gpg-agent as described in its documentation, this 
variable is set to the correct value.  The option --gpg-agent-info can 
be used to override it. 
<DT>http_proxy<DD>
Only honored when the keyserver-option 
honor-http-proxy is set.

<H2>WARNINGS </H2>

<P>

Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good* passphrase 
to protect your secret key.  This passphrase is the weakest part of the 
whole system.  Programs to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring 
are very easy to write and so you should protect your &quot;~/.gnupg/&quot; 
directory very well. 
<P>

Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a network (telnet), it 
is *very* easy to spy out your passphrase! 
<P>

If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the 
program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line 
or use <B>-</B> to specify stdin. 
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS </H2>

<P>

GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP 
standard.  In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts 
of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2 
compression algorithms.  It is important to be aware that not all 
OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by 
forcing their use via the --cipher-algo, --digest-algo, 
--cert-digest-algo, or --compress-algo options in GnuPG, it is 
possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that 
cannot be read by the intended recipient. 
<P>

There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each 
supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms. 
For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported 
the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm.  A message using BLOWFISH simply could 
not be read by a PGP user.  By default, GnuPG uses the standard 
OpenPGP preferences system that will always do the right thing and 
create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which 
OpenPGP program they use.  Only override this safe default if you 
really know what you are doing. 
<P>

If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the 
preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far 
better off using the --pgp6, --pgp7, or --pgp8 options.  These options 
are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in violation 
of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a &quot;PGP-safe&quot; 
list. 
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS </H2>

<P>

On many systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This 
is necessary to lock memory pages.  Locking memory pages prevents the 
operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain 
passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk.  If you get no 
warning message about insecure memory your operating system supports 
locking without being root.  The program drops root privileges as soon 
as locked memory is allocated.
