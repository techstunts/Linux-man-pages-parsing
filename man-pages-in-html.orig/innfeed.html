<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

This man page describes version 1.0 of innfeed.
<P>

<I>Innfeed</I>

implements the NNTP protocol for transferring news between computers. It
handles both the standard IHAVE protocol as well as the CHECK/TAKETHIS
streaming extension. Innfeed can feed any number of remote hosts at once
and will open multiple connections to each host if configured to do so. The
only limitations are the process limits for open file descriptors and memory.





<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MODES</H2>

<P>

<I>Innfeed</I>

has three modes of operation: channel, funnel-file and batch.
<P>

Channel mode is used when no filename is given on the command line,
the ``input-file'' keyword is <I>not</I> given in the config file, <I>and</I>
the ``<I>-x</I>'' option is <I>not</I> given.
In channel mode innfeed runs with stdin connected via a pipe to
innd. Whenever innd closes this pipe (and it has several reasons during
normal processing to do so), innfeed will exit. It first will try to
finish sending all articles it was in the middle of transmitting, before
issuing a QUIT command. This means innfeed may take a while to exit
depending on how slow your peers are. It never (well, almost never) just
drops the connection.
<P>

Funnel-file mode is used when a filename is given as an argument
or the ``input-file'' keyword is given in the config file.
In funnel file mode it reads the specified file for the same formatted
information as innd would give in channel mode. It is expected that innd is
continually writing to this file, so when innfeed reaches the end of the file
it will check periodically for new information. To prevent the funnel file
from growing without bounds, you will need to periodically move the file to
the side (or simply remove it) and have innd flush the file. Then, after
the file is flushed by innd, you can send innfeed a SIGALRM, and it too
will close the file and open the new file created by innd. Something like:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
innfeed -p /var/run/news/innfeed.pid my-funnel-file &amp;
while true; do
        sleep 43200
        rm -f my-funnel-file
        ctlinnd flush funnel-file-site
        kill -ALRM `cat /var/run/news/innfeed.pid`
done
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Batch mode is used when the ``<I>-x</I>'' flag is used.
In batch mode innfeed will ignore stdin, and will simply process any
backlog created by a previously running innfeed. This mode is not normally
needed as innfeed will take care of backlog processing.





<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFIGURATION</H2>

Innfeed expects a couple of things to be able to run correctly: a directory
where it can store backlog files and a configuration file to describe which
peers it should handle.
<P>

The configuration file is described in <A HREF="../man5/innfeed.conf.5.php">innfeed.conf</A>(5). The ``<I>-c</I>''
option can be used to specify a different file.
<P>

For each peer (say, ``<I>foo</I>''), innfeed manages up to 4 files in the
backlog directory: a ``<I>foo.lock</I>'' file, which prevents other
instances of innfeed from interfering with this one; a ``<I>foo.input</I>''
file which has old article information innfeed is reading for
re-processing; a ``<I>foo.output</I>'' file where innfeed is writing
information on articles that couldn't be processed (normally due to a slow
or blocked peer); and a ``<I>foo</I>'' file.
<P>

This last file (``<I>foo</I>'') is never created by innfeed, but if innfeed
notices it, it will rename it to ``<I>foo.input</I>'' at the next
opportunity and will start reading from it. This lets you create a batch
file and put it in a place where innfeed will find it. You should never
alter the .input or .output files of a running innfeed.
<P>

The format of these last three files is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
/path/to/article &lt;message-id&gt;
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

This is the same as the first two fields of the lines innd feeds to
innfeed, and the same as the first two fields of the lines of the batch
file innd will write if innfeed is unavailable for some reason. When
innfeed processes its own batch files it ignores everything after the first
two whitespace separated fields, so moving the innd-created batch file to
the appropriate spot will work, even though the lines are longer.
<P>

Innfeed writes its current status to the file ``<I>innfeed.status</I>'' (or
the file given by the ``<I>-S</I>'' option). This file contains details on
the process as a whole, and on each peer this instance of innfeed is
managing.
<P>

If innfeed is told to send an article to a host it is not managing, then
the article information will be put into a file matching the pattern
``<I>innfeed-dropped.*</I>'', with part of the file name matching the pid of
the innfeed process that is writing to it.  Innfeed will not process this
file except to write to it. If nothing is written to the file then it will
be removed if innfeed exits normally.





<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SIGNALS</H2>

<P>

Upon receipt of a SIGALRM innfeed will close the funnel-file specified on
the command line, and will reopen it (see funnel file description above).
<P>

Innfeed with catch SIGINT and will write a large debugging snapshot of the
state of the running system.
<P>

Innfeed will catch SIGHUP and will reload the config file. 
See <A HREF="../man5/innfeed.conf.5.php">innfeed.conf</A>(5) for more details.
<P>

Innfeed will catch SIGCHLD and will close and reopen all backlog files.
<P>

Innfeed will catch SIGTERM and will do an orderly shutdown.
<P>

Upon receipt of a SIGUSR1 innfeed will increment the debugging level by
one, receipt of a SIGUSR2 will decrement it by one. The debugging level
starts at zero (unless the ``-d'' option it used), and no debugging
information is emitted. A larger value for the level means more debugging
information. Numbers up to 5 are currently useful.





<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYSLOG ENTRIES</H2>

<P>

There are 3 different categories of syslog entries for statistics. Host,
Connection and Global.
<P>

The Host statistics are generated for a given peer at regular intervals
after the first connection is made (or, if the remote is unreachable, after
spooling starts). The Host statistics give totals over all Connections that
have been active during the given time frame. For example (broken here to
fit the page, with ``vixie'' being the peer):
<P>

<PRE>
  May 23 12:49:08 data innfeed[16015]: vixie checkpoint
                seconds 1381 offered 2744 accepted 1286 
                refused 1021 rejected 437 missing 0 spooled 990
                on_close 0 unspooled 240 deferred 10 requeued 25
                queue 42.1/100:14,35,13,4,24,10
</PRE>

<P>

These meanings of these fields are:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>seconds<DD>
The time since innfeed connected to the host or since the statistics
were reset by a ``final'' log entry.
<DT>offered<DD>
The number of IHAVE commands sent to the host if it is not in streaming mode.
The sum of the number of TAKETHIS commands sent when no-CHECK mode
is in effect plus the number CHECK commands sent in streaming mode (when
no-CHECK mode is not in effect).
<DT>accepted<DD>
The number of articles which were sent to the remote host and accepted
by it.
<DT>refused<DD>
The number of articles offered to the host that it it indicated it
didn't want because it had already seen the Message-ID.  The remote
host indicates this by sending a 435 response to an IHAVE command or
a 438 response to a CHECK command.
<DT>rejected<DD>
The number of articles transferred to the host that it did not accept
because it determined either that it already had the article or it did
not want it because of the article's Newsgroups: or Distribution: headers,
etc.  The remote host indicates that it is rejecting the article by
sending a 437 or 439 response after innfeed sent the entire article.
<DT>missing<DD>
The number of articles which innfeed was told to offer to the host but
which were not present in the article spool.  These articles were probably
cancelled or expired before innfeed was able to offer them to the host.
<DT>spooled<DD>
The number of article entries that were written to the .output backlog file
because the articles could not either be sent to the host or be refused
by it.  Articles are generally spooled either because new articles are
arriving more quickly than they can be offered to the host, or because
innfeed closed all the connections to the host and pushed all the
articles currently in progress to the .output backlog file.
<DT>on_close<DD>
The number of articles that were spooled when innfeed closed all the
connections to the host.
<DT>unspooled<DD>
The number of article entries that were read from the .input backlog
file.
<DT>deferred<DD>
The number of articles that the host told innfeed to retry later by
sending a 431 or 436 response.  Innfeed immediately puts these articles
back on the tail of the queue.
<DT>requeued<DD>
The number of articles that were in progress on connections when innfeed
dropped those connections and put the articles back on the queue.  These
connections may have been broken by a network problem or became unresponsive
causing innfeed to time them out.
<DT>queue<DD>
The first number is the average (mean) queue size during the previous logging
interval.  The second number is the maximum allowable queue size.
The third number is the percentage of the time that the queue
was empty.  The fourth through seventh numbers are the percentages of the
time that the queue was &gt;0% to 25% full, 25% to 50% full, 50% to 75%
full, and 75% to &lt;100% full.  The last number is the percentage of the
time that the queue was totally full.
</DL>
<P>

If the ``<I>-z</I>'' option is used (see below), then when the peer stats are
generated, each Connection will log its stats too. For example, for
connection number zero (from a set of five):
<P>

<PRE>
  May 23 12:49:08 data innfeed[16015]: vixie:0 checkpoint
                seconds 1381 offered 596 accepted 274 
                refused 225 rejected 97
</PRE>

<P>

If you only open a maximum of one Connection to a remote, then there will
be a close correlation between Connection numbers and Host numbers, but in
general you can't tie the two sets of number together in any easy or very
meaningful way. When a Connection closes it will always log its stats.
<P>

If all Connections for a Host get closed together, then the Host logs its
stats as ``final'' and resets its counters. If the feed is so busy that
there's always at least one Connection open and running, then after some
amount of time (set via the config file), the Host stats are logged as
final and reset. This is to make generating higher level stats from log
files, by other programs, easier.
<P>

There is one log entry that is emitted for a Host just after its last
Connection closes and innfeed is preparing to exit. This entry contains
counts over the entire life of the process. The ``seconds'' field is from the
first time a Connection was successfully built, or the first time spooling
started. If a Host has been completely idle, it will have no such log entry.
<P>

<PRE>

                seconds 1381 offered 34 accepted 22 
                refused 3 rejected 7 missing 0
</PRE>

<P>

The final log entry is emitted immediately before exiting. It contains a
summary of the statistics over the entire life of the process.
<P>

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-a</I>'' flag is used to specify the top of the article spool
tree. Innfeed does a <A HREF="../man2/chdir.2.php">chdir</A>(2) to this directory, so it should probably be
an absolute path. The default is &lt;patharticles&nbsp;in&nbsp;inn.conf&gt;.
<DT><B>-b</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-b</I>'' flag may be used to specify a different directory for backlog
file storage and retrieval. If the path is relative then it is relative
to &lt;pathspool&nbsp;in&nbsp;inn.conf&gt;. The default is ``<I>innfeed</I>''.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-c</I>'' flag may be used to specify a different config file from the
default value. If the path is relative then it is relative to
&lt;pathetc&nbsp;in&nbsp;inn.conf&gt;. The default is ``<I>innfeed.conf</I>''.
<DT><B>-C </B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-C</I>'' flag is used to have innfeed simply check the config
file, report on any errors and then exit.
<DT><B>-d </B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-d</I>'' flag may be used to specify the initial logging level. All
debugging messages to to stderr (see the ``<I>-l</I>'' flag below.
<DT><B>-e</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-e</I>'' flag may be used to specify the size limit (in bytes) for the
<I>.output</I> backlog files innfeed creates. If the output file gets bigger
than 10% more than the given number, innfeed will replace the output file
with the tail of the original version. The default value is 0, which means
there is no limit.
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Use the ``<I>-h</I>'' flag to print the usage message.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
The  ``<I>-l</I>'' flag may be used to specify a different log file from
stderr. As innd starts innfeed with stderr attached to /dev/null using this
option can be useful in catching any abnormal error messages, or andy
debugging messages (all ``normal'' errors messages go to syslog).
<DT><B>-M</B>

<DD>
If innfeed has been built with mmap support, then the ``<I>-M</I>'' flag
turns OFF the use of mmap(), otherwise it has no effect.
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-m</I>'' flag is used to turn on logging of all missing
articles. Normally if an article is missing, innfeed keeps a count, but
logs no further information. When this flag is used, details about
message-id and expected pathname are logged.
<DT><B>-o</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-o</I>'' flag sets a value of the maximum number of bytes of article
data innfeed is supposed to keep in memory. This doesn't work properly yet.
<DT><B>-p </B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-p</I>'' flag is used to specify the filename to write the pid of the
process into. A relative path is relative to &lt;pathrun&nbsp;in&nbsp;inn.conf&gt;. The
default is ``<I>innfeed.pid</I>''.
<DT><B>-S</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-S</I>'' flag specifies the name of the file to write the periodic
staus to. If the path is relative it is considered relative to
&lt;pathlog&nbsp;in&nbsp;inn.conf&gt;. The default is ``<I>innfeed.status</I>''.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
When the ``<I>-v</I>'' flag is given, version information is printed to stderr
and then innfeed exits.
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-x</I>'' flag is used to tell innfeed not to expect any article
information from innd but just to process any backlog files that exist and
then exit.
<DT><B>-y</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-y</I>'' flag is used to allow dynamic peer binding. If this flag is
used and article information is received from innd that specifies an
unknown peer, then the peer name is taken to be the IP name too, and an
association with it is created. Using this it is possible to only 
have the global defaults in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/innfeed.conf.5.php">innfeed.conf</A></I>(5)

file, provided the peername as used by innd is the same as the ip name.
Note that
<I>innfeed</I>

with ``<I>-y</I>'' and no peer in
<I><A HREF="../man5/innfeed.conf.5.php">innfeed.conf</A></I>(5)

would cause a problem that
<I>innfeed</I>

drops the first article.
<DT><B>-z</B>

<DD>
The ``<I>-z</I>'' flag is used to cause each connection, in a parallel feed
configuration, to report statistics when the controller for the connections
prints its statistics.
<DT>
<DD>




</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<P>

When using the ``-x'' option, the config file entry's
``initial-connections'' field will be the total number of connections
created and used--no matter how many big the batch file, and no
matter how big the ``max-connectiond'' field specifies. Thus a value
of 0 for ``initial-connections'', means nothing will happen in ``-x''
mode.
<P>

Innfeed does not automatically grab the file out of out.going--this needs
to be prepared for it by external means.
<P>

Probably too many other bugs to count.
