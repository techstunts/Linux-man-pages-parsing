<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

dc_test - Distributed session cache testing and benchmarking tool
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAC"></A>
<B>dc_test</B> -connect &lt;addr&gt; [options]
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAD"></A>
<B>dc_test</B> runs a configurable number of session caching operations against a
given network address using the <I><A HREF="../man8/distcache.8.php">distcache</A></I>(8) protocol. This is typically to
verify an installation, to help diagnose problems, and to measure latency
and/or throughput. The given address could be for an instance of <B>dc_client</B>
or directly to a running instance of <B>dc_server</B>. Note that whenever the
service is running over TCP/IPv4, use of the <B>-persistent</B> flag is advised
because many systems will fairly quickly exhaust the limit of available
file-descriptors and stop allowing new sockets until the closed connections
finish with the <FONT SIZE="-1">TIME_WAIT</FONT> state.
<P>

<B>dc_test</B> runs one cache operation at a time, so it provides an accurate
measurement of latency in the distcache architecture being tested. However if
one wants to test the potential throughput of the architecture when multiple
cache operations occur in parallel (and distcache tools are asynchronous to
scale well in such circumstances), it makes sense to launch multiple instances
of <B>dc_test</B> in parallel.
<P>

<B>dc_test</B> attempts to verify correctness of any optimisation caching tricks in
distcache tools by creating an array of ``sessions'' in advance and then
sending sending <FONT SIZE="-1">ADD</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GET</FONT>, and <FONT SIZE="-1">REMOVE</FONT> requests on these sessions chosen
completely at random. As such, many of these requests <B>should</B> fail, and
<B>dc_test</B> will itself immediately halt with an error if any operation that
should succeed fails or any operation that should fail succeeds.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAE"></A>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-connect</B> address<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAF"></A>
This flag specifies the address <B>dc_test</B> should connect and send cache
operation requests to.
<DT><B>-progress</B> num<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAG"></A>
Normally <B>dc_test</B> will remain silent while testing is in progress and will
only produce output when complete (whether it is because an error was detected
or because the required number of operations have completd). With this flag, a
line of output is produced each time another <B>num</B> operations have been
completed. This can be useful for giving an intuitive idea of the latency in
the architecture and to verify that neither <B>dc_test</B> nor the tools it
connects to have deadlocked.


<P>


The default value for this flag is 0, which leaves <B>dc_test</B> silent until it
has completed.
<DT><B>-sessions</B> num<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAH"></A>
This flag controls the number of sample sessions created by <B>dc_test</B> before
testing begins. The default value is 10.
<DT><B>-datamin</B> num<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAI"></A>

<DT><B>-datamax</B> num<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAJ"></A>

The sessions created by <B>dc_test</B> during initialisation have random session
IDs between 10 and 63 bytes in length, and random session data of varying
length also.  The minimum length of the session data is set by the <B>-datamin</B>
switch, and the maximum length is set by the <B>-datamax</B> switch. The default
value for <B>-datamin</B> is 50, and the default for <B>-datamax</B> is 2100.
<DT><B>-timeout</B> secs<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAK"></A>

<DT><B>-timevar</B> secs<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAL"></A>

The sessions created by <B>dc_test</B> during initialisation have random timeouts
associated with them, so as to better probe for potential expiry-ordering bugs
in a cache server. Each session addition to a cache server must specify an
expiry period after which the cache will be automatically removed if it hasn't
already been removed explicitly or implicitly because of the <FONT SIZE="-1">FIFO</FONT> behaviour of
a full cache. The <B>-timeout</B> switch specifies the average timeout for creating
sessions with, and the <B>-timevar</B> switch specifies the range above or below the
average that session timeouts should be (randomly) chosen from.


<P>


The default value for <B>-timeout</B> is 60 seconds, and the default value for
<B>-timevar</B> is 5 seconds.


<P>


If <B>dc_server</B> is not running as a daemon, then it can also be useful to watch
it's behaviour after testing has finished (or in the middle of subsequent
testing) because it should automatically scroll out test sessions as their
expiry period runs out. See also the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>BUGS</I></FONT><I></I> section.
<DT><B>-ops</B> num<DD>
<A NAME="ixAAM"></A>
<B>dc_test</B> does not (yet) support running indefinitely (see the <I></I><FONT SIZE="-1"><I>BUGS</I></FONT><I></I> section
for the primary reason), so it will run until any error has been observed or
until it has successfully performed a configurable number of operations. The
<B>-ops</B> switch can be used to set this number of operations.


<P>


If <B>-ops</B> is not supplied on the command-line, it's default value will be
calculated from the number of sessions created (which is itself controlled by
<B>-sessions</B>). This default is 10*(sessions^2). As the default number of
sessions is 10, the default number of operations is thus 1000.
<DT><B>-persistent</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAN"></A>
The default behaviour of <B>dc_test</B> is to open and close a connection to the
target address (controlled by <B>-connect</B>) for every operation. This is the
logical choice when connecting to an instance of <B>dc_client</B> as it is the mode
of operation employed by most applications that integrate with distcache.
However, it can be desirable to measure the behaviour of the architecture when
all operations are taking place over a single established ``persistent''
connection. This is more certainly the case when connecting directly to an
instance of <B>dc_server</B> over TCP/IPv4, as <B>dc_server</B> forks a child process
for each connection and TCP/IPv4 does not react well to thousands of
connections being opened and closed in a short space of time.


<P>


Using the <B>-persistent</B> switch, a single connection will be opened to the
target address when <B>dc_test</B> initialises, and all cache operations will use
this connection.
<DT><B>-h</B>, <B>-help</B>, <B>-?</B><DD>
<A NAME="ixAAO"></A>
Any of these flags will cause <B>dc_test</B> to display a brief usage summary to
the console and exit cleanly. Any other flags are ignored.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<A NAME="ixAAP"></A>
<B>dc_test</B> will monitor each of the sessions it creates during intialisation to
determine whether it thinks it should already be present in the destination
session cache or not. Using this state, it determines whether it expects a
corresponding <FONT SIZE="-1">ADD</FONT>, <FONT SIZE="-1">GET</FONT>, or <FONT SIZE="-1">DELETE</FONT> operation on the session to succeed or fail.
<FONT SIZE="-1">GET</FONT> and <FONT SIZE="-1">DELETE</FONT> should fail if the session is not supposed to be in the cache
(if it has never been added or was last seen in a <FONT SIZE="-1">DELETE</FONT> operation). Likewise,
<FONT SIZE="-1">ADD</FONT> should fail if the session is supposed to be in the cache. None of this
logic, however, pays any attention to the expiry period in each of these
sessions and so if a long enough test is run (high value of <B>ops</B> or a slow
architecture) and/or short session timeouts are used, it becomes possible for
this state to become incorrect when the cache itself expires sessions that
<B>dc_test</B> thinks should still be in the cache. This bug should be hard to
trigger even with long tests or short timeouts, because a session needs to be
added to the cache and then not <FONT SIZE="-1">DELETE</FONT>'d during a long enough period that the
server gets a chance to expire it.
