<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>zip</I>

is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS,
OS/2, Windows NT, Minix, Atari and Macintosh, Amiga and Acorn RISC OS.
<P>

It is analogous to a combination of the UNIX commands
<I><A HREF="../man1/tar.1.php">tar</A></I>(1)

and
<I><A HREF="../man1/compress.1.php">compress</A></I>(1)

and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP for MSDOS systems).
<P>

A companion program
(<I><A HREF="../man1L/unzip.1L.php">unzip</A></I>(1L)),

unpacks
<I>zip</I>

archives.
The
<I>zip</I>

and
<I><A HREF="../man1L/unzip.1L.php">unzip</A></I>(1L)

programs can work with archives produced by PKZIP,
and PKZIP and PKUNZIP can work with archives produced by
<I>zip</I>.

<I>zip</I>

version 2.3 is compatible with PKZIP 2.04.
Note that PKUNZIP 1.10 cannot extract files produced by PKZIP 2.04
or
<I>zip</I>

2.3. You must use PKUNZIP 2.04g or
<I>unzip</I>

5.0p1 (or later versions) to extract them.
<P>

For a brief help on
<I>zip</I>

and
<I>unzip,</I>

run each without specifying any parameters on the command line.
<P>

The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution;
for archiving files;
and for saving disk space by temporarily
compressing unused files or directories.
<P>

The
<I>zip</I>

program puts one or more compressed files into a single
<I>zip</I>

archive,
along with information about the files
(name, path, date, time of last modification, protection,
and check information to verify file integrity).
An entire directory structure can be packed into a
<I>zip</I>

archive with a single command.
Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.
<I>zip</I>

has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without
compression.
<I>zip</I>

automatically chooses the better of the two for each file to be compressed.
<P>

When given the name of an existing
<I>zip</I>

archive,
<I>zip</I>

will replace identically named entries in the
<I>zip</I>

archive or add entries for new names.
For example,
if
<I>foo.zip</I>

exists and contains
<I>foo/file1</I>

and
<I>foo/file2</I>,

and the directory
<I>foo</I>

contains the files
<I>foo/file1</I>

and
<I>foo/file3</I>,

then:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo
</DL>
<P>

will replace
<I>foo/file1</I>

in
<I>foo.zip</I>

and add
<I>foo/file3</I>

to
<I>foo.zip</I>.

After this,
<I>foo.zip</I>

contains
<I>foo/file1</I>,

<I>foo/file2</I>,

and
<I>foo/file3</I>,

with
<I>foo/file2</I>

unchanged from before.
<P>

If the file list is specified as
<B>-@</B>,

[Not on MacOS]
<I>zip</I>

takes the list of input files from standard input.
Under UNIX,
this option can be used to powerful effect in conjunction with the
<I><A HREF="../man1/find.1.php">find</A></I>(1)

command.
For example,
to archive all the C source files in the current directory and
its subdirectories:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
find . -name &quot;*.[ch]&quot; -print | zip source -@
</DL>
<P>

(note that the pattern must be quoted to keep the shell from expanding it).
<I>zip</I>

will also accept a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the zip file name, in which case it
will write the zip file to standard output, allowing the output to be piped
to another program. For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r - . | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k
</DL>
<P>

would write the zip output directly to a tape with the specified block size
for the purpose of backing up the current directory.
<P>

<I>zip</I>

also accepts a single dash (&quot;-&quot;) as the name of a file to be compressed, in
which case it will read the file from standard input, allowing zip to take
input from another program. For example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
tar cf - . | zip backup -
</DL>
<P>

would compress the output of the tar command for the purpose of backing up
the current directory. This generally produces better compression than
the previous example using the -r option, because
<I>zip</I>

can take advantage of redundancy between files. The backup can be restored
using the command
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
unzip -p backup | tar xf -
</DL>
<P>

When no zip file name is given and stdout is not a terminal,
<I>zip</I>

acts as a filter, compressing standard input to standard output.
For example,
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
tar cf - . | zip | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k
</DL>
<P>

is equivalent to
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
tar cf - . | zip - - | dd of=/dev/nrst0 obs=16k
</DL>
<P>

<I>zip</I>

archives created in this manner can be extracted with the program
<I>funzip</I>

which is provided in the
<I>unzip</I>

package, or by
<I>gunzip</I>

which is provided in the
<I>gzip</I>

package. For example:
<P>

dd if=/dev/nrst0  ibs=16k | funzip | tar xvf -
<P>

When changing an existing
<I>zip</I>

archive,
<I>zip</I>

will write a temporary file with the new contents,
and only replace the old one when the process of creating the new version
has been completed without error.
<P>

If the name of the
<I>zip</I>

archive does not contain an extension, the extension
<I>.zip</I>

is added. If the name already contains an extension other than
<I>.zip</I>

the existing extension is kept unchanged.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
[Systems using EBCDIC] Translate file to ASCII format.
<DT><B>-A</B>

<DD>
Adjust self-extracting executable archive.
A self-extracting executable archive is created by prepending
the SFX stub to an existing archive. The
<B>-A</B>

option tells
<I>zip</I>

to adjust the entry offsets stored
in the archive to take into account this &quot;preamble&quot; data.
</DL>
<P>

Note: self-extracting archives for the Amiga are a special case.
At present, only the Amiga port of Zip is capable of adjusting
or updating these without corrupting them. -J can be used to remove
the SFX stub if other updates need to be made.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-B</B>

<DD>
[VM/CMS and MVS] force file to be read binary (default is text).
<DT><B>-Bn</B>

<DD>
[TANDEM] set Edit/Enscribe formatting options with n defined as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  0: Don't add delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit 1: Use LF rather than CR/LF as delimiter (Edit/Enscribe)
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  2: Space fill record to maximum record length (Enscribe)
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  3: Trim trailing space (Enscribe)
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit 8: Force 30K (Expand) large read for unstructured files
</DL>

<DT><B>-b&nbsp;path</B>

<DD>
Use the specified
<I>path</I>

for the temporary
<I>zip</I>

archive. For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -b /tmp stuff *
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will put the temporary
<I>zip</I>

archive in the directory
<I>/tmp</I>,

copying over
<I>stuff.zip</I>

to the current directory when done. This option is only useful when
updating an existing archive, and the file system containing this
old archive does not have enough space to hold both old and new archives
at the same time.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Add one-line comments for each file.
File operations (adding, updating) are done first,
and the user is then prompted for a one-line comment for each file.
Enter the comment followed by return, or just return for no comment.
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
Remove (delete) entries from a
<I>zip</I>

archive.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -d foo foo/tom/junk foo/harry/\* \*.o
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will remove the entry
<I>foo/tom/junk</I>,

all of the files that start with
<I>foo/harry/</I>,

and all of the files that end with
<I>.o</I>

(in any path).
Note that shell pathname expansion has been inhibited with backslashes,
so that
<I>zip</I>

can see the asterisks,
enabling
<I>zip</I>

to match on the contents of the
<I>zip</I>

archive instead of the contents of the current directory.
<DT><DD>
Under MSDOS,
<B>-d</B>

is case sensitive when it matches names in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
This requires that file names be entered in upper case if they were
zipped by PKZIP on an MSDOS system.
<DT><B>-df</B>

<DD>
[MacOS] Include only data-fork of files zipped into the archive.
Good for exporting files to foreign operating-systems.
Resource-forks will be ignored at all.
<DT><B>-D</B>

<DD>
Do not create entries in the
<I>zip</I>

archive for directories.  Directory entries are created by default so that
their attributes can be saved in the zip archive.
The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with sh:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
ZIPOPT=&quot;-D&quot;; export ZIPOPT
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
(The variable ZIPOPT can be used for any option except
<B>-i</B>

and
<B>-x</B>

and can include several options.) The option
<B>-D</B>

is a shorthand
for
<B>-x</B>

&quot;*/&quot; but the latter cannot be set as default in the ZIPOPT environment
variable.
<DT><B>-e</B>

<DD>
Encrypt the contents of the
<I>zip</I>

archive using a password which is entered on the terminal in response
to a prompt
(this will not be echoed; if standard error is not a tty,
<I>zip</I>

will exit with an error).
The password prompt is repeated to save the user from typing errors.
<DT><B>-E</B>

<DD>
[OS/2] Use the .LONGNAME Extended Attribute (if found) as filename.
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Replace (freshen) an existing entry in the
<I>zip</I>

archive only if it has been modified more recently than the
version already in the
<I>zip</I>

archive;
unlike the update option
(<B>-u</B>)

this will not add files that are not already in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -f foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
This command should be run from the same directory from which the original
<I>zip</I>

command was run,
since paths stored in
<I>zip</I>

archives are always relative.
<DT><DD>
Note that the timezone environment variable TZ should be set according to
the local timezone in order for the
<B>-f</B>

,
<B>-u</B>

and
<B>-o</B>

options to work correctly.
<DT><DD>
The reasons behind this are somewhat subtle but have to do with the differences
between the Unix-format file times (always in GMT) and most of the other
operating systems (always local time) and the necessity to compare the two.
A typical TZ value is ``MET-1MEST'' (Middle European time with automatic
adjustment for ``summertime'' or Daylight Savings Time).
<DT><B>-F</B>

<DD>
Fix the
<I>zip</I>

archive. This option can be used if some portions of the archive
are missing. It is not guaranteed to work, so you MUST make a backup
of the original archive first.
<DT><DD>
When doubled as in
<B>-FF</B>

the compressed sizes given inside the damaged archive are not trusted
and zip scans for special signatures to identify the limits between
the archive members. The single
<B>-F</B>

is more reliable if the archive is not too much damaged, for example
if it has only been truncated, so try this option first.
<DT><DD>
Neither option will recover archives that have been incorrectly
transferred in ascii mode instead of binary. After the repair, the
<B>-t</B>

option of
<I>unzip</I>

may show that some files have a bad CRC. Such files cannot be recovered;
you can remove them from the archive using the
<B>-d</B>

option of
<I>zip.</I>

<DT><B>-g</B>

<DD>
Grow (append to) the specified
<I>zip</I>

archive, instead of creating a new one. If this operation fails,
<I>zip</I>

attempts to restore the archive to its original state. If the restoration
fails, the archive might become corrupted. This option is ignored when
there's no existing archive or when at least one archive member must be
updated or deleted.
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Display the
<I>zip</I>

help information (this also appears if
<I>zip</I>

is run with no arguments).
<DT><B>-i&nbsp;files</B>

<DD>
Include only the specified files, as in:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo . -i \*.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will include only the files that end in
<I></I>.c

in the current directory and its subdirectories. (Note for PKZIP
users: the equivalent command is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
pkzip -rP foo *.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
PKZIP does not allow recursion in directories other than the current one.)
The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the
name matching is performed by
<I>zip</I>

at all directory levels.
<DT><DD>
Also possible:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo  . <A HREF="mailto:-i@include.lst">-i@include.lst</A>
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will only include the files in the current directory and its
subdirectories that match the patterns in the file include.lst.
<DT><B>-I</B>

<DD>
[Acorn RISC OS] Don't scan through Image files.  When used, zip will not
consider Image files (eg. DOS partitions or Spark archives when SparkFS
is loaded) as directories but will store them as single files.
<P>
For example, if you have SparkFS loaded, zipping a Spark archive will result
in a zipfile containing a directory (and its content) while using the 'I'
option will result in a zipfile containing a Spark archive. Obviously this
second case will also be obtained (without the 'I' option) if SparkFS isn't
loaded.
<DT><B>-j</B>

<DD>
Store just the name of a saved file (junk the path), and do not store
directory names. By default,
<I>zip</I>

will store the full path (relative to the current path).
<DT><B>-jj</B>

<DD>
[MacOS] record Fullpath (+ Volname). The complete path including
volume will be stored. By default the relative path will be stored.
<DT><B>-J</B>

<DD>
Strip any prepended data (e.g. a SFX stub) from the archive.
<DT><B>-k</B>

<DD>
Attempt to convert the names and paths to conform to MSDOS,
store only the MSDOS attribute (just the user write attribute from UNIX),
and mark the entry as made under MSDOS (even though it was not);
for compatibility with PKUNZIP under MSDOS which cannot handle certain
names such as those with two dots.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
Translate the Unix end-of-line character LF into the
MSDOS convention CR LF. This option should not be used on binary files.
This option can be used on Unix if the zip file is intended for PKUNZIP
under MSDOS. If the input files already contain CR LF, this option adds
an extra CR. This ensure that
<I>unzip -a</I>

on Unix will get back an exact copy of the original file,
to undo the effect of
<I>zip -l.</I>

<DT><B>-ll</B>

<DD>
Translate the MSDOS end-of-line CR LF into Unix LF.
This option should not be used on binary files.
This option can be used on MSDOS if the zip file is intended for unzip
under Unix.
<DT><B>-L</B>

<DD>
Display the
<I>zip</I>

license.
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
Move the specified files into the
<I>zip</I>

archive; actually,
this deletes the target directories/files after making the specified
<I>zip</I>

archive. If a directory becomes empty after removal of the files, the
directory is also removed. No deletions are done until
<I>zip</I>

has created the archive without error.
This is useful for conserving disk space,
but is potentially dangerous so it is recommended to use it in
combination with
<B>-T</B>

to test the archive before removing all input files.
<DT><B>-n&nbsp;suffixes</B>

<DD>
Do not attempt to compress files named with the given
<I>suffixes.</I>

Such files are simply stored (0% compression) in the output zip file,
so that
<I>zip</I>

doesn't waste its time trying to compress them.
The suffixes are separated by
either colons or semicolons.  For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -rn .Z:.zip:.tiff:.gif:.snd  foo foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will copy everything from
<I>foo</I>

into
<I>foo.zip</I>,

but will store any files that end in
<I>.Z</I>,

<I>.zip</I>,

<I>.tiff</I>,

<I>.gif</I>,

or
<I>.snd</I>

without trying to compress them
(image and sound files often have their own specialized compression methods).
By default,
<I>zip</I>

does not compress files with extensions in the list
<I>.Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj.</I>

Such files are stored directly in the output archive.
The environment variable ZIPOPT can be used to change the default options. For
example under Unix with csh:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
setenv ZIPOPT &quot;-n .gif:.zip&quot;
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
To attempt compression on all files, use:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -n : foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The maximum compression option
<B>-9</B>

also attempts compression on all files regardless of extension.
<DT><DD>
On Acorn RISC OS systems the suffixes are actually filetypes (3 hex digit
format). By default, zip does not compress files with filetypes in the list
DDC:D96:68E (i.e. Archives, CFS files and PackDir files).
<DT><B>-N</B>

<DD>
[Amiga, MacOS] Save Amiga or MacOS filenotes as zipfile comments. They can be
restored by using the -N option of unzip. If -c is used also, you are prompted
for comments only for those files that do not have filenotes.
<DT><B>-o</B>

<DD>
Set the &quot;last modified&quot; time of the
<I>zip</I>

archive to the latest (oldest) &quot;last modified&quot; time
found among the entries in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
This can be used without any other operations, if desired.
For example:
<DT><DD>
zip -o foo
<DT><DD>
will change the last modified time of
<I>foo.zip</I>

to the latest time of the entries in
<I>foo.zip</I>.

<DT><DT><B>-P</B>&nbsp;<I>password</I><DD>
<DD>
use <I>password</I> to encrypt zipfile entries (if any).  <B>THIS IS
INSECURE!</B>  Many multi-user operating systems provide ways for any user to
see the current command line of any other user; even on stand-alone systems
there is always the threat of over-the-shoulder peeking.  Storing the plaintext
password as part of a command line in an automated script is even worse.
Whenever possible, use the non-echoing, interactive prompt to enter passwords.
(And where security is truly important, use strong encryption such as Pretty
Good Privacy instead of the relatively weak encryption provided by standard
zipfile utilities.)
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>
Quiet mode;
eliminate informational messages and comment prompts.
(Useful, for example, in shell scripts and background tasks).
<DT><B>-Qn</B>

<DD>
[QDOS] store information about the file in the file header with n defined as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  0: Don't add headers for any file
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  1: Add headers for all files
</DL>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
bit  2: Don't wait for interactive key press on exit
</DL>

<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Travel the directory structure recursively;
for example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
In this case, all the files and directories in
<I>foo</I>

are saved in a
<I>zip</I>

archive named
<I>foo.zip</I>,

including files with names starting with &quot;.&quot;,
since the recursion does not use the shell's file-name substitution mechanism.
If you wish to include only a specific subset of the files in directory
<I>foo</I>

and its subdirectories, use the
<B>-i</B>

option to specify the pattern of files to be included.
You should not use
<B>-r</B>

with the name &quot;.*&quot;,
since that matches &quot;..&quot;
which will attempt to zip up the parent directory
(probably not what was intended).
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Travel the directory structure recursively starting at the
current directory;
for example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -R foo '*.c'
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
In this case, all the files matching *.c in the tree starting at the
current directory are stored into a
<I>zip</I>

archive named
<I>foo.zip</I>.

Note for PKZIP users: the equivalent command is
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
pkzip -rP foo *.c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>-S</B>

<DD>
[MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32 and ATARI] Include system and hidden files.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
[MacOS] Includes finder invisible files, which are ignored otherwise.
</DL>

<DT><B>-t&nbsp;mmddyyyy</B>

<DD>
Do not operate on files modified prior to the specified date,
where
<I>mm</I>

date format
<I>yyyy-mm-dd</I>

is also accepted.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -rt 12071991 infamy foo
<P>
zip -rt 1991-12-07 infamy foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will add all the files in
<I>foo</I>

and its subdirectories that were last modified on or after 7 December 1991,
to the
<I>zip</I>

archive
<I>infamy.zip</I>.

<DT><B>-tt&nbsp;mmddyyyy</B>

<DD>
Do not operate on files modified after or at the specified date,
where
<I>mm</I>

is the month (0-12),
<I>dd</I>

is the day of the month (1-31),
and
<I>yyyy</I>

is the year.
The
<I>ISO 8601</I>

date format
<I>yyyy-mm-dd</I>

is also accepted.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -rtt 11301995 infamy foo
<P>
zip -rtt 1995-11-30 infamy foo
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will add all the files in
<I>foo</I>

and its subdirectories that were last modified before the 30 November 1995,
to the
<I>zip</I>

archive
<I>infamy.zip</I>.

<DT><B>-T</B>

<DD>
Test the integrity of the new zip file. If the check fails, the old zip file
is unchanged and (with the
<B>-m</B>

option) no input files are removed.
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>
Replace (update) an existing entry in the
<I>zip</I>

archive only if it has been modified more recently
than the version already in the
<I>zip</I>

archive.
For example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -u stuff *
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
will add any new files in the current directory,
and update any files which have been modified since the
<I>zip</I>

archive
<I>stuff.zip</I>

was last created/modified (note that
<I>zip</I>

will not try to pack
<I>stuff.zip</I>

into itself when you do this).
<DT><DD>
Note that the
<B>-u</B>

option with no arguments acts like the
<B>-f</B>

(freshen) option.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Verbose mode or print diagnostic version info.
<DT><DD>
Normally, when applied to real operations, this option enables the display of a
progress indicator during compression and requests verbose diagnostic
info about zipfile structure oddities.
<DT><DD>
When
<B>-v</B>

is the only command line argument, and stdout is not redirected to a file,
a diagnostic screen is printed. In addition to the help screen header
with program name, version, and release date, some pointers to the Info-ZIP
home and distribution sites are given. Then, it shows information about the
target environment (compiler type and version, OS version, compilation date
and the enabled optional features used to create the
<I>zip</I>

executable.
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
[VMS] Save VMS file attributes.
<I>zip</I>

archives created with this option will generally not be usable
on other systems.
<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
[VMS] Append the version number of the files to the name,
including multiple versions of files.  (default: use only
the most recent version of a specified file).
<DT><B>-x&nbsp;files</B>

<DD>
Explicitly exclude the specified files, as in:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo -x \*.o
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will include the contents of
<I>foo</I>

in
<I>foo.zip</I>

while excluding all the files that end in
<I></I>.o<I>.</I>

The backslash avoids the shell filename substitution, so that the
name matching is performed by
<I>zip</I>

at all directory levels.
<DT><DD>
Also possible:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo <A HREF="mailto:-x@exclude.lst">-x@exclude.lst</A>
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
which will include the contents of
<I>foo</I>

in
<I>foo.zip</I>

while excluding all the files that match the patterns in the file exclude.lst.
<DT><B>-X</B>

<DD>
Do not save extra file attributes (Extended Attributes on OS/2, uid/gid
and file times on Unix).
<DT><B>-y</B>

<DD>
Store symbolic links as such in the
<I>zip</I>

archive,
instead of compressing and storing the file referred to by the link
(UNIX only).
<DT><B>-z</B>

<DD>
Prompt for a multi-line comment for the entire
<I>zip</I>

archive.
The comment is ended by a line containing just a period,
or an end of file condition (^D on UNIX, ^Z on MSDOS, OS/2, and VAX/VMS).
The comment can be taken from a file:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -z foo &lt; foowhat
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>-#</B>

<DD>
Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit
<I>#</I>,

where
<B>-0</B>

indicates no compression (store all files),
<B>-1</B>

indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)
and
<B>-9</B>

indicates the slowest compression method (optimal compression, ignores
the suffix list). The default compression level is
<B>-6.</B>

<DT><B>-!</B>

<DD>
[WIN32] Use priviliges (if granted) to obtain all aspects of WinNT security.
<DT><B>-@</B>

<DD>
Take the list of input files from standard input. Only one filename per line.
<DT><B>-$</B>

<DD>
[MSDOS, OS/2, WIN32] Include the volume label for the the drive holding
the first file to be compressed.  If you want to include only the volume
label or to force a specific drive, use the drive name as first file name,
as in:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -$ foo a: c:bar
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

The simplest example:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip stuff *
</DL>
<P>

creates the archive
<I>stuff.zip</I>

(assuming it does not exist)
and puts all the files in the current directory in it, in compressed form
(the
<I>.zip</I>

suffix is added automatically,
unless that archive name given contains a dot already;
this allows the explicit specification of other suffixes).
<P>

Because of the way the shell does filename substitution,
files starting with &quot;.&quot; are not included;
to include these as well:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip stuff .* *
</DL>
<P>

Even this will not include any subdirectories from the current directory.
<P>

To zip up an entire directory, the command:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -r foo foo
</DL>
<P>

creates the archive
<I>foo.zip</I>,

containing all the files and directories in the directory
<I>foo</I>

that is contained within the current directory.
<P>

You may want to make a
<I>zip</I>

archive that contains the files in
<I>foo</I>,

without recording the directory name,
<I>foo</I>.

You can use the
<B>-j</B>

option to leave off the paths,
as in:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -j foo foo/*
</DL>
<P>

If you are short on disk space,
you might not have enough room to hold both the original directory
and the corresponding compressed
<I>zip</I>

archive.
In this case, you can create the archive in steps using the
<B>-m</B>

option.
If
<I>foo</I>

contains the subdirectories
<I>tom</I>,

<I>dick</I>,

and
<I>harry</I>,

you can:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
zip -rm foo foo/tom
<BR>

zip -rm foo foo/dick
<BR>

zip -rm foo foo/harry
</DL>
<P>

where the first command creates
<I>foo.zip</I>,

and the next two add to it.
At the completion of each
<I>zip</I>

command,
the last created archive is deleted,
making room for the next
<I>zip</I>

command to function.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PATTERN MATCHING</H2>

This section applies only to UNIX.
Watch this space for details on MSDOS and VMS operation.
<P>

The UNIX shells
(<I><A HREF="../man1/sh.1.php">sh</A></I>(1)

and
<I><A HREF="../man1/csh.1.php">csh</A></I>(1))

do filename substitution on command arguments.
The special characters are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>?</B>

<DD>
match any single character
<DT><B>*</B>

<DD>
match any number of characters (including none)
<DT><B>[]</B>

<DD>
match any character in the range indicated within the brackets
(example: [a-f], [0-9]).
</DL>
<P>

When these characters are encountered
(without being escaped with a backslash or quotes),
the shell will look for files relative to the current path
that match the pattern,
and replace the argument with a list of the names that matched.
<P>

The
<I>zip</I>

program can do the same matching on names that are in the
<I>zip</I>

archive being modified or,
in the case of the
<B>-x</B>

(exclude) or
<B>-i</B>

(include) options, on the list of files to be operated on, by using
backslashes or quotes to tell the shell not to do the name expansion.
In general, when
<I>zip</I>

encounters a name in the list of files to do, it first looks for the name in
the file system.  If it finds it, it then adds it to the list of files to do.
If it does not find it, it looks for the name in the
<I>zip</I>

archive being modified (if it exists), using the pattern matching characters
described above, if present.  For each match, it will add that name to the
list of files to be processed, unless this name matches one given
with the
<B>-x</B>

option, or does not match any name given with the
<B>-i</B>

option.
<P>

The pattern matching includes the path,
and so patterns like \*.o match names that end in &quot;.o&quot;,
no matter what the path prefix is.
Note that the backslash must precede every special character (i.e. ?*[]),
or the entire argument must be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).
<P>

In general, use backslash to make
<I>zip</I>

do the pattern matching with the
<B>-f</B>

(freshen) and
<B>-d</B>

(delete) options,
and sometimes after the
<B>-x</B>

(exclude) option when used with an appropriate operation (add,
<B>-u</B>,

<B>-f</B>,

or
<B>-d</B>).

<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

The exit status (or error level) approximates the exit codes defined by PKWARE
and takes on the following values, except under VMS:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>0<DD>
normal; no errors or warnings detected.
<DT>2<DD>
unexpected end of zip file.
<DT>3<DD>
a generic error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing may have
completed successfully anyway; some broken zipfiles created by other
archivers have simple work-arounds.
<DT>4<DD>
<I>zip</I> was unable to allocate memory for one or more buffers during
program initialization.
<DT>5<DD>
a severe error in the zipfile format was detected.  Processing probably
failed immediately.
<DT>6<DD>

VMS interprets standard Unix (or PC) return values as other, scarier-looking
things, so <I>zip</I> instead maps them into VMS-style status codes.  The
current mapping is as follows:   1 (success) for normal exit,
<BR>&nbsp;and&nbsp;(0x7fff000?&nbsp;+&nbsp;16*normal_zip_exit_status)&nbsp;for&nbsp;all&nbsp;errors,&nbsp;where&nbsp;the
`?' is 0 (warning) for <I>zip</I> value 12, 2 (error) for the
<I>zip</I> values 3, 6, 7, 9, 13, 16, 18,
and 4 (fatal error) for the remaining ones.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<I>zip</I>

2.3 is not compatible with PKUNZIP 1.10. Use
<I>zip</I>

1.1 to produce
<I>zip</I>

files which can be extracted by PKUNZIP 1.10.
<P>

<I>zip</I>

files produced by
<I>zip</I>

2.3 must not be
<I>updated</I>

by
<I>zip</I>

1.1 or PKZIP 1.10, if they contain
encrypted members or if they have been produced in a pipe or on a non-seekable
device. The old versions of
<I>zip</I>

or PKZIP would create an archive with an incorrect format.
The old versions can list the contents of the zip file
but cannot extract it anyway (because of the new compression algorithm).
If you do not use encryption and use regular disk files, you do
not have to care about this problem.
<P>

Under VMS,
not all of the odd file formats are treated properly.
Only stream-LF format
<I>zip</I>

files are expected to work with
<I>zip</I>.

Others can be converted using Rahul Dhesi's BILF program.
This version of
<I>zip</I>

handles some of the conversion internally.
When using Kermit to transfer zip files from Vax to MSDOS, type &quot;set
file type block&quot; on the Vax.  When transfering from MSDOS to Vax, type
&quot;set file type fixed&quot; on the Vax.  In both cases, type &quot;set file type
binary&quot; on MSDOS.
<P>

Under VMS, zip hangs for file specification that uses DECnet syntax
<I>foo::*.*.</I>

<P>

On OS/2, zip cannot match some names, such as those including an
exclamation mark or a hash sign.  This is a bug in OS/2 itself: the
32-bit DosFindFirst/Next don't find such names.  Other programs such
as GNU tar are also affected by this bug.
<P>

Under OS/2, the amount of Extended Attributes displayed by DIR is (for
compatibility) the amount returned by the 16-bit version of
DosQueryPathInfo(). Otherwise OS/2 1.3 and 2.0 would report different
EA sizes when DIRing a file.
However, the structure layout returned by the 32-bit DosQueryPathInfo()
is a bit different, it uses extra padding bytes and link pointers (it's
a linked list) to have all fields on 4-byte boundaries for portability
to future RISC OS/2 versions. Therefore the value reported by
<I>zip</I>

(which uses this 32-bit-mode size) differs from that reported by DIR.
<I>zip</I>

stores the 32-bit format for portability, even the 16-bit
MS-C-compiled version running on OS/2 1.3, so even this one shows the
32-bit-mode size.

<H2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</H2>

Thanks to R. P. Byrne for his
<I>Shrink.Pas</I>

program, which inspired this project,
and from which the shrink algorithm was stolen;
to Phil Katz for placing in the public domain the
<I>zip</I>

file format, compression format, and .ZIP filename extension, and for
accepting minor changes to the file format; to Steve Burg for
clarifications on the deflate format; to Haruhiko Okumura and Leonid
Broukhis for providing some useful ideas for the compression
algorithm; to Keith Petersen, Rich Wales, Hunter Goatley and Mark
Adler for providing a mailing list and
<I>ftp</I>

site for the Info-ZIP group to use; and most importantly, to the
Info-ZIP group itself (listed in the file
<I>infozip.who</I>)

without whose tireless testing and bug-fixing efforts a portable
<I>zip</I>

would not have been possible.
Finally we should thank (blame) the first Info-ZIP moderator,
David Kirschbaum,
for getting us into this mess in the first place.
The manual page was rewritten for UNIX by R. P. C. Rodgers.
