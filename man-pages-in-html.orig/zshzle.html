<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NAME</H2>

zshzle - zsh command line editor

<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

If the <B>ZLE</B> option is set (which it is by default in interactive shells)
and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the user
is able to edit command lines.
<P>

There are two display modes.  The first, multiline mode, is the
default.  It only works if the <B>TERM</B> parameter is set to a valid
terminal type that can move the cursor up.  The second, single line
mode, is used if <B>TERM</B> is invalid or incapable of moving the
cursor up, or if the <B>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</B> option is set.
This mode
is similar to <B>ksh</B>, and uses no termcap sequences.  If <B>TERM</B> is
&quot;emacs&quot;, the <B>ZLE</B> option will be unset by default.
<P>

The parameters <B>BAUD</B>, <B>COLUMNS</B>, and <B>LINES</B> are also used by the
line editor.
See <I>Parameters Used By The Shell</I> in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1).
<P>

<P>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>KEYMAPS</H2>

A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences
and ZLE commands.  The empty key sequence cannot be bound.
<P>

There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap has one
or more names.  If all of a keymap's names are deleted, it disappears.
<B>bindkey</B> can be used to manipulate keymap names.
<P>

Initially, there are four keymaps:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>emacs</B><DD>
EMACS emulation
<DT><B>viins</B><DD>
vi emulation - insert mode
<DT><B>vicmd</B><DD>
vi emulation - command mode
<DT><B>.safe</B><DD>
fallback keymap

</DL>
<P>

The `<B>.safe</B>' keymap is special.  It can never be altered, and the name
can never be removed.  However, it can be linked to other names, which can
be removed.  In the future other special keymaps may be added; users should
avoid using names beginning with `<B>.</B>' for their own keymaps.
<P>

In addition to these four names, either `<B>emacs</B>' or `<B>viins</B>' is
also linked to the name `<B>main</B>'.  If one of the <B>VISUAL</B> or
<B>EDITOR</B> environment variables contain the string `<B>vi</B>' when the shell
starts up then it will be `<B>viins</B>', otherwise it will be `<B>emacs</B>'.
<B>bindkey</B>'s <B>-e</B> and <B>-v</B>
options provide a convenient way to override this default choice.
<P>

When the editor starts up, it will select the `<B>main</B>' keymap.
If that keymap doesn't exist, it will use `<B>.safe</B>' instead.
<P>

In the `<B>.safe</B>' keymap, each single key is bound to <B>self-insert</B>,
except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are bound to <B>accept-line</B>.
This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if you are using it, it
means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put it back.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Reading Commands</H3>

When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a sequence
that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer bound string.
In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more characters
are typed, and if not (or they don't match any longer string) it will
execute the binding.  This timeout is defined by the <B>KEYTIMEOUT</B> parameter;
its default is 0.4 sec.  There is no timeout if the prefix string is not
itself bound to a command.
<P>

As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other strings, by using
`<B>bindkey -s</B>'.
When such a sequence is read, the replacement string is pushed back as input,
and the command reading process starts again using these fake keystrokes.
This input can itself invoke further replacement strings, but in order to
detect loops the process will be stopped if there are twenty such replacements
without a real command being read.
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ZLE BUILTINS</H2>

The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The <B>bindkey</B>
command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the <B>vared</B> command invokes
ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the <B>zle</B> command manipulates
editing widgets and allows command line access to ZLE commands from within
shell functions.
<P>

<B>bindkey</B> [ <I>options</I> ] [ <I>in-string</I> ]
<B>bindkey</B>'s options can be divided into three categories: keymap selection,
operation selection, and others.  The keymap selection options are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-e</B>
Selects keymap `<B>emacs</B>', and also links it to `<B>main</B>'.
<DT><B>-v</B><DD>
Selects keymap `<B>viins</B>', and also links it to `<B>main</B>'.
<DT><B>-a</B><DD>
Selects keymap `<B>vicmd</B>'.
<DT><B>-M</B> <I>keymap</I><DD>
The <I>keymap</I> specifies a keymap name.
</DL>
<P>

If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above are used, the
`<B>main</B>' keymap is used.  Some operations do not permit a keymap to be
selected, namely:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-l</B>
List all existing keymap names.  If the <B>-L</B>
option is also used, list in the form of <B>bindkey</B>
commands to create the keymaps.
<DT><B>-d</B><DD>
Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default state.
<DT><B>-D</B> <I>keymap</I> ...<DD>
Delete the named <I>keymap</I>s.
<DT><B>-A</B> <I>old-keymap new-keymap</I><DD>
Make the <I>new-keymap</I> name an alias for <I>old-keymap</I>, so that
both names refer to the same keymap.  The names have equal standing;
if either is deleted, the other remains.  If there is already a keymap
with the <I>new-keymap</I> name, it is deleted.
<DT><B>-N</B> <I>new-keymap</I> [ <I>old-keymap</I> ]<DD>
Create a new keymap, named <I>new-keymap</I>.  If a keymap already has that
name, it is deleted.  If an <I>old-keymap</I> name is given, the new keymap
is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will
be empty.
</DL>
<P>

To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to <B>main</B>.  Hence
the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap `<B>mymap</B>'
initialized from the <B>emacs</B> keymap (which remains unchanged) is:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey -N mymap emacs
bindkey -A mymap main</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

Note that while `<B>bindkey -A</B> <I>newmap</I> <B>main</B>' will work when
<I>newmap</I> is <B>emacs</B> or <B>viins</B>, it will not work for <B>vicmd</B>, as
switching from vi insert to command mode becomes impossible.
<P>

The following operations act on the `<B>main</B>' keymap if no keymap
selection option was given:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-m</B>
Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the selected keymap.
Only keys that are unbound or bound to <B>self-insert</B> are affected.
<DT><B>-r</B> <I>in-string</I> ...<DD>
Unbind the specified <I>in-string</I>s in the selected keymap.
This is exactly equivalent to binding the strings to <B>undefined-key</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When <B>-R</B> is also used, interpret the <I>in-string</I>s as ranges.
<P>

When <B>-p</B> is also used, the <I>in-string</I>s specify prefixes.  Any
binding that has the given <I>in-string</I> as a prefix, not including the
binding for the <I>in-string</I> itself, if any, will be removed.  For
example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>bindkey -rpM viins '^['</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap beginning with an escape
character (probably cursor keys), but leave the binding for the escape
character itself (probably <B>vi-cmd-mode</B>).  This is incompatible with the
option <B>-R</B>.
</DL>

<DT><B>-s</B> <I>in-string out-string</I> ...<DD>
Bind each <I>in-string</I> to each <I>out-string</I>.
When <I>in-string</I> is typed, <I>out-string</I> will be
pushed back and treated as input to the line editor.
When <B>-R</B> is also used, interpret the <I>in-string</I>s as ranges.
<DT><I>in-string command</I> ...<DD>
Bind each <I>in-string</I> to each <I>command</I>.
When <B>-R</B> is used, interpret the <I>in-string</I>s as ranges.
<DT>[ <I>in-string</I> ]<DD>
List key bindings.  If an <I>in-string</I> is specified, the binding of
that string in the selected keymap is displayed.  Otherwise, all key
bindings in the selected keymap are displayed.  (As a special case,
if the <B>-e</B> or <B>-v</B> option is used alone, the keymap is <I>not</I>
displayed - the implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that
happens.)
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When the option <B>-p</B> is used, the <I>in-string</I> must be present.
The listing shows all bindings which have the given key sequence as a
prefix, not including any bindings for the key sequence itself.
<P>

When the <B>-L</B> option is used, the list is in the form of <B>bindkey</B>
commands to create the key bindings.
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

When the <B>-R</B> option is used as noted above, a valid range consists of
two characters, with an optional `<B>-</B>' between them.  All characters
between the two specified, inclusive, are bound as specified.
<P>

For either <I>in-string</I> or <I>out-string</I>, the following
escape sequences are recognised:
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>\a</B><DD>
bell character
<DT><B>\b</B><DD>
backspace
<DT><B>\e</B>, <B>\E</B><DD>
escape
<DT><B>\f</B><DD>
form feed
<DT><B>\n</B><DD>
linefeed (newline)
<DT><B>\r</B><DD>
carriage return
<DT><B>\t</B><DD>
horizontal tab
<DT><B>\v</B><DD>
vertical tab
<DT><B>\</B><I>NNN</I><DD>
character code in octal
<DT><B>\x</B><I>NN</I><DD>
character code in hexadecimal
<DT><B>\M</B>[<B>-</B>]<I>X</I><DD>
character with meta bit set
<DT><B>\C</B>[<B>-</B>]<I>X</I><DD>
control character
<DT><B>^</B><I>X</I><DD>
control character

</DL>
<P>

In all other cases, `<B>\</B>' escapes the following character.  Delete is
written as `<B>^?</B>'.  Note that `<B>\M^?</B>' and `<B>^\M?</B>' are not the same,
and that (unlike emacs), the bindings `<B>\M-</B><I>X</I>' and `<B>\e</B><I>X</I>'
are entirely distinct, although they are initialized to the same bindings
by `<B>bindkey -m</B>'.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>vared</B> [ <B>-Aache</B> ] [ <B>-p</B> <I>prompt</I> ] [ <B>-r</B> <I>rprompt</I> ] <I>name</I><DD>
The value of the parameter <I>name</I> is loaded into the edit
buffer, and the line editor is invoked.  When the editor exits,
<I>name</I> is set to the string value returned by the editor.
When the <B>-c</B> flag is given, the parameter is created if it doesn't
already exist.  The <B>-a</B> flag may be given with <B>-c</B> to create
an array parameter, or the <B>-A</B> flag to create an associative array.
If the type of an existing parameter does not match the type to be
created, the parameter is unset and recreated.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If an array or array slice is being edited, separator characters as defined
in <B>$IFS</B> will be shown quoted with a backslash, as will backslashes
themselves.  Conversely, when the edited text is split into an array, a
backslash quotes an immediately following separator character or backslash;
no other special handling of backslashes, or any handling of quotes, is
performed.
<P>

Individual elements of existing array or associative array parameters
may be edited by using subscript syntax on <I>name</I>.  New elements are
created automatically, even without <B>-c</B>.
<P>

If the <B>-p</B> flag is given, the following string will be taken as
the prompt to display at the left.  If the <B>-r</B> flag is given,
the following string gives the prompt to display at the right.  If the
<B>-h</B> flag is specified, the history can be accessed from ZLE. If the 
<B>-e</B> flag is given, typing <B>^D</B> (Control-D) on an empty line
causes <B>vared</B> to exit immediately with a non-zero return value.

<DT>
<DD>
<B>zle</B>
The <B>zle</B> builtin performs a number of different actions concerning
ZLE.  Which operation it performs depends on its options:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>-l</B> [ <B>-L</B> | <B>-a</B> ]
List all existing user-defined widgets.  If the <B>-L</B>
option is used, list in the form of <B>zle</B>
commands to create the widgets.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When combined with the <B>-a</B> option, all widget names are listed,
including the builtin ones. In this case the <B>-L</B> option is ignored.
<P>

If at least one <I>string</I> is given, nothing will be printed but the
return status will be zero if all <I>string</I>s are names of existing
widgets (or of user-defined widgets if the <B>-a</B> flag is not given)
and non-zero if at least one <I>string</I> is not a name of an defined
widget.
</DL>

<DT><B>-D</B> <I>widget</I> ...<DD>
Delete the named <I>widget</I>s.
<DT><B>-A</B> <I>old-widget</I> <I>new-widget</I><DD>
Make the <I>new-widget</I> name an alias for <I>old-widget</I>, so that
both names refer to the same widget.  The names have equal standing;
if either is deleted, the other remains.  If there is already a widget
with the <I>new-widget</I> name, it is deleted.
<DT><B>-N</B> <I>widget</I> [ <I>function</I> ]<DD>
Create a user-defined widget.  If there is already a widget with the
specified name, it is overwritten.  When the new
widget is invoked from within the editor, the specified shell <I>function</I>
is called.  If no function name is specified, it defaults to
the same name as the widget.  For further information, see the section
<I>Widgets</I> in
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshzle.1.php">zshzle</A></I>(1).
<DT><B>-C</B> <I>widget</I> <I>completion-widget</I> <I>function</I><DD>
Create a user-defined completion widget named <I>widget</I>. The 
completion widget will behave like the built-in completion-widget
whose name is given as <I>completion-widget</I>. To generate the
completions, the shell function <I>function</I> will be called.
For further information, see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshcompwid.1.php">zshcompwid</A></I>(1).
<DT><B>-R</B> [ <B>-c</B> ] [ <I>display-string</I> ] [ <I>string</I> ... ]<DD>
Redisplay the command line; this is to be called from within a user-defined
widget to allow changes to become visible.  If a <I>display-string</I> is
given and not empty, this is shown in the status line (immediately
below the line being edited).
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

If the optional <I>string</I>s are given they are listed below the
prompt in the same way as completion lists are printed. If no
<I>string</I>s are given but the <B>-c</B> option is used such a list is
cleared.
<P>

Note that this option is only useful for widgets that do not exit
immediately after using it because the strings displayed will be erased 
immediately after return from the widget.
<P>

This command can safely be called outside user defined widgets; if zle is
active, the display will be refreshed, while if zle is not active, the
command has no effect.  In this case there will usually be no other
arguments.  The status is zero if zle was active, else one.
</DL>

<DT><B>-M</B> <I>string</I><DD>
As with the <B>-R</B> option, the <I>string</I> will be displayed below the 
command line; unlike the <B>-R</B> option, the string will not be put into
the status line but will instead be printed normally below the
prompt.  This means that the <I>string</I> will still be displayed after
the widget returns (until it is overwritten by subsequent commands).
<DT><B>-U</B> <I>string</I><DD>
This pushes the characters in the <I>string</I> onto the input stack of
ZLE.  After the widget currently executed finishes ZLE will behave as
if the characters in the <I>string</I> were typed by the user.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

As ZLE uses a stack, if this option is used repeatedly
the last string pushed onto the stack will be processed first.  However,
the characters in each <I>string</I> will be processed in the order in which
they appear in the string.
</DL>

<DT><B>-K</B> <I>keymap</I><DD>
Selects the keymap named <I>keymap</I>.  An error message will be displayed if
there is no such keymap.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

This keymap selection affects the interpretation of following keystrokes
within this invocation of ZLE.  Any following invocation (e.g., the next
command line) will start as usual with the `<B>main</B>' keymap selected.
</DL>

<DT><B>-F</B> [ <B>-L</B> ] [ <I>fd</I> [ <I>handler</I> ] ]<DD>
Only available if your system supports one of the `poll' or `select' system
calls; most modern systems do.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Installs <I>handler</I> (the name of a shell function) to handle input from
file descriptor <I>fd</I>.  When zle is attempting to read data, it will
examine both the terminal and the list of handled <I>fd</I>'s.  If data
becomes available on a handled <I>fd</I>, zle will call <I>handler</I> with
the fd which is ready for reading as the only argument.  If the handler
produces output to the terminal, it should call `<B>zle -I</B>' before doing
so (see below).  The handler should not attempt to read from the terminal.
Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this fd is actually
readable when installing the handler.  The user must make their own
arrangements for handling the file descriptor when zle is not active.
<P>

Any number of handlers for any number of readable file descriptors may be
installed.  Installing a handler for an <I>fd</I> which is already handled
causes the existing handler to be replaced.
<P>

If no <I>handler</I> is given, but an <I>fd</I> is present, any handler for
that <I>fd</I> is removed.  If there is none, an error message is printed
and status 1 is returned.
<P>

If no arguments are given, or the <B>-L</B> option is supplied, a list of
handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later execution.
<P>

An <I>fd</I> (but not a <I>handler</I>) may optionally be given with the <B>-L</B>
option; in this case, the function will list the handler if any, else
silently return status 1.
<P>

Note that this feature should be used with care.  Activity on one of the
<I>fd</I>'s which is not properly handled can cause the terminal to become
unusable.
<P>

Here is a simple example of using this feature.  A connection to a remote
TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see 
the description of the <B>zsh/net/tcp</B> module in <I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1).  Then a handler is installed
which simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection.  Note
that `select' will indicate that the file descriptor needs handling
if the remote side has closed the connection; we handle that by testing
for a failed read.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>if ztcp pwspc 2811; then
  tcpfd=$REPLY
  handler() {
    zle -I
    local line
    if ! read -r line &lt;&amp;$1; then
      # select marks this fd if we reach EOF,
      # so handle this specially.
      print &quot;[Read on fd $1 failed, removing.]&quot; &gt;&amp;2
      zle -F $1
      return 1
    fi
    print -r - $line
  }
  zle -F $tcpfd handler
fi</B>

</DL>

</DL>

<DT><B>-I</B><DD>
Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary widget functions,
though it may be used within if normal output to the terminal is required.
It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output; typically
this will be from a trap function.  It has no effect if zle is not
active.  When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display needs
restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as not to
disturb the line being edited:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>TRAPUSR1() {
    # Invalidate zle display
  [[ -o zle ]] &amp;&amp; zle -I
    # Show output
  print Hello
}</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is active before
using this method (as shown in the example), since the <B>zsh/zle</B> module
may not even be loaded; if it is not, the command can be skipped.
<P>

It is possible to call `<B>zle -I</B>' several times before control is
returned to the editor; the display will only be invalidated the first time
to minimise disruption.
<P>

Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating the display from
within zle widgets; see, for example, `<B>zle -R</B>' above.
<P>

The status is zero if zle is active and the current zle display has
been invalidated (even if this was by a previous call to `<B>zle -I</B>'),
else one.
</DL>

<DT><I>widget</I> <B>[ -n</B> <I>num</I> <B>]</B> <B>[ -N ]</B> <I>args</I> ...<DD>
Invoke the specified widget.  This can only be done when ZLE is
active; normally this will be within a user-defined widget.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

With the options <B>-n</B> and <B>-N</B>, the current numerical argument will be
saved and then restored after the call to <B>widget</B>; `<B>-n</B> <I>num</I>'
sets the numerical argument temporarily to <I>num</I>, while `<B>-N</B>' sets it
to the default, i.e. as if there were none.
<P>

Any further arguments will be passed to the widget.  If it is a shell
function, these are passed down as positional parameters; for builtin
widgets it is up to the widget in question what it does with them.
Currently arguments are only handled by the incremental-search commands,
the <B>history-search-forward</B> and <B>-backward</B> and the corresponding
functions prefixed by <B>vi-</B>, and by <B>universal-argument</B>.  No error is
flagged if the command does not use the arguments, or only uses some of
them.
<P>

The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation carried
out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget the return status of
the shell function.  
<P>

A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget exits,
unless the <B>BEEP</B> options was unset or the widget was called via the
<B>zle</B> command.  Thus if a user defined widget requires an immediate beep,
it should call the <B>beep</B> widget directly.
</DL>

</DL>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

With no options and no arguments, only the return status will be
set. It is zero if ZLE is currently active and widgets could be
invoked using this builtin command and non-zero if ZLE is not active.


<P>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WIDGETS</H2>

All actions in the editor are performed by `widgets'.  A widget's job is
simply to perform some small action.  The ZLE commands that key sequences
in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets.  Widgets can be user-defined
or built in.
<P>

The standard widgets built in to ZLE are listed in Standard Widgets below.
Other built-in widgets can be defined by other modules (see
<I><A HREF="../man1/zshmodules.1.php">zshmodules</A></I>(1)).  Each built-in widget has two names: its normal canonical name, and the
same name preceded by a `<B>.</B>'.  The `<B>.</B>' name is special: it can't be
rebound to a different widget.  This makes the widget available even when
its usual name has been redefined.
<P>

User-defined widgets are defined using `<B>zle -N</B>', and implemented
as shell functions.  When the widget is executed, the corresponding
shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other) actions.
It is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names
starting with `<B>.</B>'.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USER-DEFINED WIDGETS</H2>

User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions,
can execute any normal shell command.  They can also run other widgets
(whether built-in or user-defined) using the <B>zle</B> builtin command.
The standard input of the function is closed to prevent external commands
from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but
<B>read -k</B> or <B>read -q</B> can be used to read characters.  Finally,
they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by
reading and setting the special parameters described below.
<P>

These special parameters are always available in widget functions, but
are not in any way special outside ZLE.  If they have some normal value
outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return
when the widget function exits.  These special parameters in fact have
local scope, like parameters created in a function using <B>local</B>.
<P>

Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active, these
parameters are available read-only.
<P>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>BUFFER</B> (scalar)
The entire contents of the edit buffer.  If it is written to, the
cursor remains at the same offset, unless that would put it outside the
buffer.
<DT><B>BUFFERLINES</B> (integer)<DD>
The number of screen lines needed for the edit buffer currently
displayed on screen (i.e. without any changes to the preceding
parameters done after the last redisplay); read-only.
<DT><B>CONTEXT</B> (scalar)<DD>
The context in which zle was called to read a line; read-only.  One of
the values:

<DT>
<DD>
start
The start of a command line (at prompt <B>PS1</B>).
<DT>cont<DD>
A continuation to a command line (at prompt <B>PS2</B>).
<DT>select<DD>
In a <B>select</B> loop.
<DT>vared<DD>
Editing a variable in <B>vared</B>.

<DT><B>CURSOR</B> (integer)<DD>
The offset of the cursor, within the edit buffer.  This is in the range
0 to <B>$#BUFFER</B>, and is by definition equal to <B>$#LBUFFER</B>.
Attempts to move the cursor outside the buffer will result in the
cursor being moved to the appropriate end of the buffer.
<DT><B>CUTBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
The last item to be cut using one of the `<B>kill-</B>' commands; the
string which the next yank would insert in the line.
<DT><B>HISTNO</B> (integer)<DD>
The current history number; read-only.
<DT><B>KEYMAP</B> (scalar)<DD>
The name of the currently selected keymap; read-only.
<DT><B>KEYS</B> (scalar)<DD>
The keys typed to invoke this widget, as a literal string; read-only.
<DT><B>killring</B> (array)<DD>
The array of previously killed items, with the most recently killed first.
This gives the items that would be retrieved by a <B>yank-pop</B> in the
same order.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The default size for the kill ring is eight, however the length may be
changed by normal array operations.  Any empty string in the kill ring is
ignored by the <B>yank-pop</B> command, hence the size of the array
effectively sets the maximum length of the kill ring, while the number of
non-zero strings gives the current length, both as seen by the user at the
command line.

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>LASTSEARCH</B> (scalar)<DD>
The last search string used by an interactive search ; read-only.
<DT><B>LASTWIDGET</B> (scalar)<DD>
The name of the last widget that was executed; read-only.
<DT><B>LBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
The part of the buffer that lies to the left of the cursor position.
If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the
cursor remains between the new <B>$LBUFFER</B> and the old <B>$RBUFFER</B>.
<DT><B>MARK</B> (integer)<DD>
Like <B>CURSOR</B>, but for the mark.
<DT><B>NUMERIC</B> (integer)<DD>
The numeric argument. If no numeric argument was given, this parameter
is unset. When this is set inside a widget function, builtin widgets
called with the <B>zle</B> builtin command will use the value
assigned. If it is unset inside a widget function, builtin widgets
called behave as if no numeric argument was given.
<DT><B>PENDING</B> (integer)<DD>
The number of bytes pending for input, i.e. the number of bytes which have
already been typed and can immediately be read. On systems where the shell
is not able to get this information, this parameter will always have a
value of zero.  Read-only.
<DT><B>PREBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
In a multi-line input at the secondary prompt, this read-only parameter
contains the contents of the lines before the one the cursor is
currently in.
<DT><B>PREDISPLAY</B> (scalar)<DD>
Text to be displayed before the start of the editable text buffer.  This
does not have to be a complete line; to display a complete line, a newline
must be appended explicitly.    The text is reset on each new invocation
(but not recursive invocation) of zle.
<DT><B>POSTDISPLAY</B> (scalar)<DD>
Text to be displayed after the end of the editable text buffer.  This
does not have to be a complete line; to display a complete line, a newline
must be prepended explicitly.  The text is reset on each new invocation
(but not recursive invocation) of zle.
<DT><B>RBUFFER</B> (scalar)<DD>
The part of the buffer that lies to the right of the cursor position.
If it is assigned to, only that part of the buffer is replaced, and the
cursor remains between the old <B>$LBUFFER</B> and the new <B>$RBUFFER</B>.

<H2>STANDARD WIDGETS</H2>

The following is a list of all the standard widgets,
and their default bindings in emacs mode,
vi command mode and vi insert mode
(the `<B>emacs</B>', `<B>vicmd</B>' and `<B>viins</B>' keymaps, respectively).
<P>

Note that cursor keys are bound to movement keys in all three keymaps;
the shell assumes that the cursor keys send the key sequences reported
by the terminal-handling library (termcap or terminfo).  The key sequences
shown in the list are those based on the VT100, common on many modern
terminals, but in fact these are not necessarily bound.  In the case of the
<B>viins</B> keymap, the initial escape character of the sequences serves also
to return to the <B>vicmd</B> keymap: whether this happens is determined by
the <B>KEYTIMEOUT</B> parameter, see <I><A HREF="../man1/zshparam.1.php">zshparam</A></I>(1).

A restricted set of editing functions

<P>

<B>magic-space</B> just inserts a space.
<B>vi-cmd-mode</B> toggles between the `<B>main</B>' and `<B>vicmd</B>' keymaps;
the `<B>main</B>' keymap (insert mode) will be selected initially.
<B>history-incremental-search-backward</B> will get the

<B>history-incremental-search-forward</B> inverts the sense of the search.
<B>vi-repeat-search</B> and <B>vi-rev-repeat-search</B> are similarly supported.
The direction of the search is indicated in the mini-buffer.
<P>

Any multi-character string
that is not bound to one of the above functions will beep and interrupt the
search, leaving the last found line in the buffer. Any single character that
is not bound to one of the above functions, or <B>self-insert</B> or
<B>self-insert-unmeta</B>, will have the same effect but the function will be
executed.
<P>

When called from a widget function by the <B>zle</B> command, the incremental
search commands can take a string argument.  This will be treated as a
string of keys, as for arguments to the <B>bindkey</B> command, and used as
initial input for the command.  Any characters in the string which are

<DT><B>history-incremental-search-forward</B> (^S ^Xs) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Search forward incrementally for a specified string.  The search is

</DL>

<DT><B>vi-history-search-forward</B> (unbound) (?) (unbound)<DD>
Search forward in the history for a specified string.
The string may begin with `<B>^</B>' to anchor the search to the

<DT><B>infer-next-history</B> (^X^N) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Search in the history list for a line matching the current one and
fetch the event following it.
<DT><B>insert-last-word</B> (ESC-_ ESC-.) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Insert the last word from the previous history event at the
cursor position.  If a positive numeric argument is given,
insert that word from the end of the previous history event.
If the argument is zero or negative insert that word from the
left (zero inserts the previous command word).  Repeating this command
replaces the word just inserted with the last word from the
history event prior to the one just used; numeric arguments can be used in
the same way to pick a word from that event.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When called from a shell function invoked from a user-defined widget, the
command can take one to three arguments.  The first argument specifies a
history offset which applies to successive calls to this widget: if is -1,
the default behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive calls will move
forwards through the history.  The value 0 can be used to indicate that the
history line examined by the previous execution of the command will be
reexamined.  Note that negative numbers should be preceded with a
`<B>-</B><B>-</B>' argument to avoid confusing them with options.
<P>

If two arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the command
line in normal array index notation (as a more natural alternative to the
prefix argument).  Hence 1 is the first word, and -1 (the default) is the
last word.
<P>

If a third argument is given, its value is ignored, but it is used to
signify that the history offset is relative to the current history line,
rather than the one remembered after the previous invocations of
<B>insert-last-word</B>.
<P>

For example, the default behaviour of the command corresponds to
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle insert-last-word -- -1 -1</B>
</PRE>

<P>

while the command
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>zle insert-last-word -- -1 1 -</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>

always copies the first word of the line in the history immediately before
the line being edited.  This has the side effect that later invocations of
the widget will be relative to that line.

Move to the previous event in the history list.
<DT><B>history-beginning-search-forward</B><DD>

<H3>Arguments</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>digit-argument</B> (ESC-0..ESC-9) (1-9) (unbound)
Start a new numeric argument, or add to the current one.
See also <B>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line</B>.  This only works if bound to a
key sequence ending in a decimal digit.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Inside a widget function, a call to this function treats the last key of
the key sequence which called the widget as the digit.
</DL>

<DT><B>neg-argument</B> (ESC--) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Changes the sign of the following argument.
<DT><B>universal-argument</B><DD>
Multiply the argument of the next command by 4.  Alternatively, if
this command is followed by an integer (positive or negative), use
that as the argument for the next command.  Thus digits cannot be
repeated using this command.  For example, if this command occurs
twice, followed immediately by <B>forward-char</B>, move forward sixteen
spaces; if instead it is followed by <B>-2</B>, then <B>forward-char</B>,
move backward two spaces.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

Inside a widget function, if passed an argument, i.e. `<B>zle
universal-argument</B> <I>num</I>', the numerical argument will be set to
<I>num</I>; this is equivalent to `<B>NUMERIC=</B><I>num</I>'.
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Completion</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>

<DT><B>complete-word</B><DD>
Attempt completion on the current word.
<DT><B>delete-char-or-list</B> (^D) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Delete the character under the cursor.  If the cursor
is at the end of the line, list possible completions for the
current word.
<DT><B>expand-cmd-path</B><DD>
Expand the current command to its full pathname.
<DT><B>expand-or-complete</B> (TAB) (unbound) (TAB)<DD>
Attempt shell expansion on the current word.
If that fails,
attempt completion.
<DT><B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B><DD>
Attempt shell expansion on the current word up to cursor.
<DT><B>expand-history</B> (ESC-space ESC-!) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Perform history expansion on the edit buffer.
<DT><B>expand-word</B> (^X*) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>

List the expansion of the current word.
<DT><B>magic-space</B><DD>
Perform history expansion and insert a space into the
buffer.  This is intended to be bound to space.
<DT><B>menu-complete</B><DD>
Like <B>complete-word</B>, except that menu completion is used.
See the <B>MENU_COMPLETE</B> option.
<DT><B>menu-expand-or-complete</B><DD>
Like <B>expand-or-complete</B>, except that menu completion is used.
<DT><B>reverse-menu-complete</B><DD>
Perform menu completion, like <B>menu-complete</B>, except that if
a menu completion is already in progress, move to the <I>previous</I>
completion rather than the next.
<DT><B>end-of-list</B><DD>
When a previous completion displayed a list below the prompt, this
widget can be used to move the prompt below the list.

<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>
<B>accept-and-hold</B> (ESC-A ESC-a) (unbound) (unbound)
Push the contents of the buffer on the buffer stack
and execute it.
<DT><B>accept-and-infer-next-history</B><DD>
Execute the contents of the buffer.
Then search the history list for a line matching the current one
and push the event following onto the buffer stack.
<DT><B>accept-line</B> (^J ^M) (^J ^M) (^J ^M)<DD>
Finish editing the buffer.  Normally this causes the buffer to be
executed as a shell command.
<DT><B>accept-line-and-down-history</B> (^O) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Execute the current line, and push the next history
event on the the buffer stack.
<DT><B>beep</B><DD>
Beep, unless the <B>BEEP</B> option is unset.
<DT><B>vi-cmd-mode</B> (^X^V) (unbound) (^[)<DD>
Enter command mode; that is, select the `<B>vicmd</B>' keymap.
Yes, this is bound by default in emacs mode.
<DT><B>vi-caps-lock-panic</B><DD>
Hang until any lowercase key is pressed.
This is for vi users without the mental capacity to keep
track of their caps lock key (like the author).
<DT><B>clear-screen</B> (^L ESC-^L) (^L) (^L)<DD>
Clear the screen and redraw the prompt.
<DT><B>describe-key-briefly</B><DD>
Reads a key sequence, then prints the function bound to that sequence.
<DT><B>exchange-point-and-mark</B> (^X^X) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Exchange the cursor position with the position of the mark.
<DT><B>execute-named-cmd</B> (ESC-x) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Read the name of an editor command and
execute it.  A restricted set of editing functions is available in the
mini-buffer.  An interrupt signal, as defined by the stty setting, will
abort the function. The allowed functions are:
<B>backward-delete-char</B>,
<B>vi-backward-delete-char</B>,
<B>clear-screen</B>,
<B>redisplay</B>,
<B>quoted-insert</B>,
<B>vi-quoted-insert</B>,
<B>backward-kill-word</B>,
<B>vi-backward-kill-word</B>,
<B>kill-whole-line</B>,

<B>backward-kill-line</B>,
<B>list-choices</B>,
<B>delete-char-or-list</B>,
<B>complete-word</B>,
<B>accept-line</B>,
<B>expand-or-complete</B> and
<B>expand-or-complete-prefix</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

<B>kill-region</B> kills the last word,
and vi-cmd-mode is treated the same as accept-line.
The space and tab characters, if not bound to one of
these functions, will complete the name and then list the
possibilities if the <B>AUTO_LIST</B> option is set.
Any other character that is not bound to <B>self-insert</B> or
<B>self-insert-unmeta</B> will beep and be ignored.
The bindings of the current insert mode will be used.
</DL>

<DT><B>execute-last-named-cmd</B> (ESC-z) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Redo the last function executed with <B>execute-named-cmd</B>.
<DT><B>get-line</B> (ESC-G ESC-g) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Pop the top line off the buffer stack and insert it at the
cursor position.
<DT><B>pound-insert</B> (unbound) (#) (unbound)<DD>
If there is no # character at the beginning of the buffer,
add one to the beginning of each line.
If there is one, remove a # from each line that has one.
In either case, accept the current line.
The <B>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</B> option must be set
for this to have any usefulness.
<DT><B>vi-pound-insert</B><DD>
If there is no # character at the beginning of the current line,
add one.  If there is one, remove it.
The <B>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</B> option must be set
for this to have any usefulness.
<DT><B>push-input</B><DD>
Push the entire current multiline construct onto the buffer stack and
return to the top-level (<B>PS1</B>) prompt.
If the current parser construct is only a single line, this is exactly
like <B>push-line</B>.
Next time the editor starts up or is popped with <B>get-line</B>, the
construct will be popped off the top of the buffer stack and loaded
into the editing buffer.
<DT><B>push-line</B> (^Q ESC-Q ESC-q) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Push the current buffer onto the buffer stack and clear
the buffer.
Next time the editor starts up, the buffer will be popped
off the top of the buffer stack and loaded into the editing
buffer.
<DT><B>push-line-or-edit</B><DD>
At the top-level (<B>PS1</B>) prompt, equivalent to <B>push-line</B>.
At a secondary (<B>PS2</B>) prompt, move the entire current multiline
construct into the editor buffer.
The latter is equivalent to <B>push-input</B> followed by <B>get-line</B>.
<DT><B>recursive-edit</B><DD>
Only useful from a user-defined widget.  At this point in the function,
the editor regains control until one of the standard widgets which would
normally cause zle to exit (typically an <B>accept-line</B> caused by
hitting the return key) is executed.  Instead, control returns to the
user-defined widget.  The status returned is non-zero if the return was
caused by an error, but the function still continues executing and hence
may tidy up.  This makes it safe for the user-defined widget to alter
the command line or key bindings temporarily.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

The following widget, <B>caps-lock</B>, serves as an example.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
<B>self-insert-ucase() {
  LBUFFER+=${(U)KEYS[-1]}
}

integer stat

zle -N self-insert self-insert-ucase
zle -A caps-lock save-caps-lock
zle -A accept-line caps-lock

zle recursive-edit
stat=$?

zle -A .self-insert self-insert
zle -A save-caps-lock caps-lock
zle -D save-caps-lock

(( stat )) &amp;&amp; zle send-break

return $stat
</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

This causes typed letters to be inserted capitalised until either
<B>accept-line</B> (i.e. typically the return key) is typed or the
<B>caps-lock</B> widget is invoked again; the later is handled by saving
the old definition of <B>caps-lock</B> as <B>save-caps-lock</B> and then
rebinding it to invoke <B>accept-line</B>.  Note that an error from the
recursive edit is detected as a non-zero return status and propagated by
using the <B>send-break</B> widget.
</DL>

<DT><B>redisplay</B> (unbound) (^R) (^R)<DD>
Redisplays the edit buffer.
<DT><B>send-break</B> (^G ESC-^G) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Abort the current editor function, e.g. <B>execute-named-command</B>, or the
editor itself, e.g. if you are in <B>vared</B>. Otherwise abort the parsing of
the current line.
<DT><B>run-help</B> (ESC-H ESC-h) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Push the buffer onto the buffer stack, and execute the
command `<B>run-help</B> <I>cmd</I>', where <I>cmd</I> is the current
command.  <B>run-help</B> is normally aliased to <B>man</B>.
<DT><B>vi-set-buffer</B> (unbound) (&quot;) (unbound)<DD>
Specify a buffer to be used in the following command.
There are 35 buffers that can be specified:
the 26 `named' buffers <B>&quot;a</B> to <B>&quot;z</B>
and the nine `queued' buffers <B>&quot;1</B> to <B>&quot;9</B>.  The named buffers can also
be specified as <B>&quot;A</B> to <B>&quot;Z</B>.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<P>

When a buffer is specified for a cut command, the text being cut replaces
the previous contents of the specified buffer.  If a named buffer
is specified using a capital, the newly cut text is appended to the buffer
instead of overwriting it.
<P>

If no buffer is specified for a cut command, <B>&quot;1</B> is used, and the
contents of <B>&quot;1</B> to <B>&quot;8</B> are each shifted along one buffer; the contents of
<B>&quot;9</B> is lost.
</DL>

<DT><B>vi-set-mark</B> (unbound) (m) (unbound)<DD>
Set the specified mark at the cursor position.
<DT><B>set-mark-command</B> (^@) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>

Attempt spelling correction on the current word.
<DT><B>undefined-key</B><DD>
This command is executed when a key sequence that is not bound to any
command is typed.  By default it beeps.
<DT><B>undo</B> (^_ ^Xu ^X^U) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Incrementally undo the last text modification.
<DT><B>redo</B><DD>
Incrementally redo undone text modifications.
<DT><B>vi-undo-change</B> (unbound) (u) (unbound)<DD>
Undo the last text modification.
If repeated, redo the modification.
<DT><B>what-cursor-position</B> (^X=) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Print the character under the cursor, its code as an octal, decimal and
hexadecimal number, the current cursor position within the buffer and the
column of the cursor in the current line.
<DT><B>where-is</B><DD>
Read the name of an editor command and and print the listing of key
sequences that invoke the specified command.
<DT><B>which-command</B> (ESC-?) (unbound) (unbound)<DD>
Push the buffer onto the buffer stack, and execute the
command `<B>which-command</B> <I>cmd</I>'. where <I>cmd</I> is the current
command.  <B>which-command</B> is normally aliased to <I>whence</I>.
<DT><B>vi-digit-or-beginning-of-line</B> (unbound) (0) (unbound)<DD>
If the last command executed was a digit as part of an argument,
continue the argument.  Otherwise, execute vi-beginning-of-line.
