nmap - Network exploration tool and security scanner
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>nmap</B>

[Scan Type(s)] [Options] &lt;host or net #1 ... [#N]&gt;
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
<I>Nmap </I>

is designed to allow system administrators and curious
individuals to scan large networks to determine which hosts
are up and what services they are offering.
<I>nmap </I>

supports a large number of scanning techniques such as: UDP, TCP
connect(), TCP SYN (half open), ftp proxy (bounce attack), ICMP (ping sweep), FIN, ACK sweep, Xmas Tree, SYN
sweep, IP Protocol, and Null scan.  See the
<I>Scan Types </I>

section for more details.  nmap also offers a number of
advanced features such as remote OS detection via TCP/IP
fingerprinting, stealth scanning, dynamic delay and
retransmission calculations, parallel scanning, detection of
down hosts via parallel pings, decoy scanning, port
filtering detection, direct (non-portmapper) RPC scanning,
fragmentation scanning, and flexible target and port
specification.
<P>

Significant effort has been put into decent nmap performance
for non-root users.  Unfortunately, many critical kernel
interfaces (such as raw sockets) require root privileges.
nmap should be run as root whenever possible (not setuid root,
of course).
<P>

The result of running nmap is usually a list of interesting
ports on the machine(s) being scanned (if any).  Nmap always
gives the port's &quot;well known&quot; service name (if any), number,
state, and protocol.  The state is either &quot;open&quot;,
&quot;filtered&quot;, or &quot;unfiltered&quot;.  Open means that the target
machine will accept() connections on that port.  Filtered
means that a firewall, filter, or other network obstacle is
covering the port and preventing nmap from determining
whether the port is open.  Unfiltered means that the port is
known by nmap to be closed and no firewall/filter seems to
be interfering with nmap's attempts to determine this.
Unfiltered ports are the common case and are only shown when
most of the scanned ports are in the filtered state.
<P>

Depending on options used, nmap may also report the
following characteristics of the remote host: OS in use, TCP
sequentiality, usernames running the programs which have
bound to each port, the DNS name, whether the host is a
smurf address, and a few others.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

Options that make sense together can generally be combined.
Some options are specific to certain scan modes.
<I>nmap </I>

tries to catch and warn the user about psychotic or
unsupported option combinations.

<P>



If you are impatient, you can skip to the
<I>examples</I>

section at the end, which demonstrates common usage.  You
can also run
<B>nmap -h</B>

for a quick reference page listing all the options.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SCAN TYPES</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>-sS</B>

<DD>
TCP SYN scan: This technique is often referred to as &quot;half-open&quot;
scanning, because you don't open a full TCP connection. You send a SYN
packet, as if you are going to open a real connection and you wait for
a response. A SYN|ACK indicates the port is listening. A RST is
indicative of a non-listener.  If a SYN|ACK is received, a RST is
immediately sent to tear down the connection (actually our OS kernel
does this for us). The primary advantage to this scanning technique is
that fewer sites will log it.  Unfortunately you need root privileges
to build these custom SYN packets.  This is the default scan type for
privileged users.
<DT><B>-sT </B>

<DD>
TCP connect() scan: This is the most basic form of TCP
scanning. The connect() system call provided by your
operating system is used to open a connection to every
interesting port on the machine. If the port is listening,
connect() will succeed, otherwise the port isn't
reachable. One strong advantage to this technique is that
you don't need any special privileges. Any user on most UNIX
boxes is free to use this call.

<P>



This sort of scan is easily detectable as target host logs will show a
bunch of connection and error messages for the services which accept()
the connection just to have it immediately shutdown.  This is the
default scan type for unprivileged users.
<DT><B>-sF -sX -sN </B>

<DD>
Stealth FIN, Xmas Tree, or Null scan modes: There are times
when even SYN scanning isn't clandestine enough. Some
firewalls and packet filters watch for SYNs to restricted
ports, and programs like Synlogger and Courtney are
available to detect these scans. These advanced scans, on
the other hand, may be able to pass through unmolested.

<P>



The idea is that closed ports are required to reply to your
probe packet with an RST, while open ports must ignore the
packets in question (see RFC 793 pp 64).  The FIN scan uses
a bare (surprise) FIN packet as the probe, while the Xmas
tree scan turns on the FIN, URG, and PUSH flags.  The Null
scan turns off all flags.  Unfortunately Microsoft (like
usual) decided to completely ignore the standard and do
things their own way.  Thus this scan type will not work
against systems running Windows95/NT.  On the positive side,
this is a good way to distinguish between the two platforms.
If the scan finds open ports, you know the machine is not a
Windows box.  If a -sF,-sX,or -sN scan shows all ports
closed, yet a SYN (-sS) scan shows ports being opened, you
are probably looking at a Windows box.  This is less useful
now that nmap has proper OS detection built in.  There are
also a few other systems that are broken in the same way
Windows is.  They include Cisco, BSDI, HP/UX, MVS, and IRIX.
All of the above send resets from the open ports when they
should just drop the packet.
<DT><B>-sP</B>

<DD>
Ping scanning: Sometimes you only want to know which hosts
on a network are up.  Nmap can do this by sending ICMP echo
request packets to every IP address on the networks you
specify.  Hosts that respond are up.  Unfortunately, some
sites such as microsoft.com block echo request packets.
Thus nmap can also send a TCP ack packet to (by default)
port 80.  If we get an RST back, that machine is up.  A
third technique involves sending a SYN packet and waiting
for a RST or a SYN/ACK.  For non-root users, a connect()
method is used.

<P>



By default (for root users), nmap uses both the ICMP and ACK
techniques in parallel.  You can change the
<B>-P </B>

option described later.

<P>



Note that pinging is done by default anyway, and only hosts
that respond are scanned.  Only use this option if you wish
to ping sweep
<B>without</B>

doing any actual port scans.
<DT><B>-sV</B>

<DD>
Version detection: Afer TCP and/or UDP ports are discovered using one
of the other scan methods, version detection communicates with those
ports to try and determine more about what is actually running.  A
file called nmap-service-probes is used to determine the best probes
for detecting various services and the match strings to expect.  Nmap
tries to determine the service protocol (e.g. ftp, ssh, telnet, http),
the application name (e.g. ISC Bind, Apache httpd, Solaris telnetd),
the version number, and sometimes miscellaneous details like whether
an X server is open to connections or the SSH protocol version).  If
Nmap was compiled with OpenSSL support, it will connect to SSL servers
to deduce the service listening behind the encryption.  When RPC
services are discovered, the Nmap RPC grinder is used to determine the
RPC program and version numbers.  Some UDP ports are left in the
&quot;open|filtered&quot; state after a UDP scan is unable to determine whether
the port is open or filtered.  Version detection will try to elicit a
response from these ports (just as it does with open ports), and
change the state to open if it succeeds. Note that the Nmap -A option
also enables this feature.  For a much more detailed description of
Nmap service detection, read our paper at
<A HREF="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/versionscan.php">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/versionscan.html</A> .  There is a related
--version_trace option which causes Nmap to print out extensive
debugging info about what version scanning is doing (this is a subset
of what you would get with --packet_trace).
<DT><B>-sU</B>

<DD>
UDP scans: This method is used to determine which UDP (User Datagram
Protocol, RFC 768) ports are open on a host.  The technique is to send
0 byte UDP packets to each port on the target machine.  If we receive
an ICMP port unreachable message, then the port is closed.  If a UDP
response is received to the probe (unusual), the port is open.  If we
get no response at all, the state is &quot;open|filtered&quot;, meaning that the
port is either open or packet filters are blocking the communication.
Versions scan (-sV) can be used to help differentiate the truly open
ports from the filtered ones.

<P>



Some people think UDP scanning is pointless. I usually
remind them of the Solaris rpcbind hole. Rpcbind can
be found hiding on an undocumented UDP port somewhere above
32770. So it doesn't matter that 111 is blocked by the
firewall. But can you find which of the more than 30,000
high ports it is listening on? With a UDP scanner you can!
There is also the cDc Back Orifice backdoor program which
hides on a configurable UDP port on Windows machines.  Not
to mention the many commonly vulnerable services that
utilize UDP such as snmp, tftp, NFS, etc.

<P>



Unfortunately UDP scanning is sometimes painfully slow since
most hosts implement a suggestion in RFC 1812 (section
4.3.2.8) of limiting the ICMP error message rate.  For
example, the Linux kernel (in net/ipv4/icmp.h) limits
destination unreachable message generation to 80 per 4
seconds, with a 1/4 second penalty if that is exceeded.
Solaris has much more strict limits (about 2 messages per
second) and thus takes even longer to scan.
<I>nmap</I>

detects this rate limiting and slows down accordingly,
rather than flood the network with useless packets that will
be ignored by the target machine.

<P>



As is typical, Microsoft ignored the suggestion of the RFC
and does not seem to do any rate limiting at all on Win95
and NT machines.  Thus we can scan all 65K ports of a
Windows machine
<B>very</B>

quickly.  Whoop!

<P>



<DT><B>-sO</B>

<DD>
IP protocol scans: This method is used to determine which IP protocols
are supported on a host.  The technique is to send raw IP packets
without any further protocol header to each specified protocol on the
target machine.  If we receive an ICMP protocol unreachable message,
then the protocol is not in use.  Otherwise we assume it is open.
Note that some hosts (AIX, HP-UX, Digital UNIX) and firewalls may not
send protocol unreachable messages.  This causes all of the protocols
to appear &quot;open&quot;.

<P>



Because the implemented technique is very similar to UDP port scanning,
ICMP rate limit might apply too. But the IP 
protocol field has only 8 bits, so at most 256 protocols can be
probed which should be possible in reasonable time anyway.
<DT><B>-sI &lt;zombie host[:probeport]&gt;</B>

<DD>
Idlescan: This advanced scan method allows for a truly blind TCP
port scan of the target (meaning no packets are sent to the target from
your real IP address).  Instead, a unique side-channel attack exploits
predictable &quot;IP fragmentation ID&quot; sequence generation on the zombie host
to glean information about the open ports on the target.  IDS systems
will display the scan as coming from the zombie machine you specify
(which must be up and meet certain criteria).  I wrote an informal
paper about this technique at
<A HREF="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/idlescan.php">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/idlescan.html</A> .

<P>



Besides being extraordinarily stealthy (due to its blind nature), this
scan type permits mapping out IP-based trust relationships between machines.
The port listing shows open ports
<I>from the perspective of the zombie host.</I>

So you can try scanning a target using various zombies that you think
might be trusted (via router/packet filter rules).  Obviously this is
crucial information when prioritizing attack targets.  Otherwise, you
penetration testers might have to expend considerable resources &quot;owning&quot; an 
intermediate system, only to find out that its IP isn't even trusted 
by the target host/network you are ultimately after.

<P>



You can add a colon followed by a port number if you wish to probe
a particular port on the zombie host for IPID changes.  Otherwise Nmap
will use the port it uses by default for &quot;tcp pings&quot;.
<DT><B>-sA</B>

<DD>
ACK scan: This advanced method is usually used to map out
firewall rulesets.  In particular, it can help determine
whether a firewall is stateful or just a simple packet
filter that blocks incoming SYN packets.

<P>



This scan type sends an ACK packet (with random looking
acknowledgment/sequence numbers) to the ports specified.
If a RST comes back, the ports is classified as
&quot;unfiltered&quot;.  If nothing comes back (or if an ICMP
unreachable is returned), the port is classified as
&quot;filtered&quot;.  Note that
<I>nmap</I>

usually doesn't print &quot;unfiltered&quot;
ports, so getting 
<B>no</B>

ports shown in the output is usually a sign that all the
probes got through (and returned RSTs). This scan will
obviously never show ports in the &quot;open&quot; state.
<DT><B>-sW</B>

<DD>
Window scan: This advanced scan is very similar to the ACK
scan, except that it can sometimes detect open ports as well
as filtered/unfiltered due to an anomaly in the TCP window
size reporting by some operating systems.  Systems
vulnerable to this include at least some versions of AIX,
Amiga, BeOS, BSDI, Cray, Tru64 UNIX, DG/UX, OpenVMS, Digital
UNIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, OS/2, IRIX, MacOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD,
OpenStep, QNX, Rhapsody, SunOS 4.X, Ultrix, VAX, and
VxWorks.  See the nmap-hackers mailing list archive for a
full list.
<DT><B>-sR  </B>

<DD>
RPC scan.  This method works in combination with the various
port scan methods of Nmap.  It takes all the TCP/UDP ports
found open and then floods them with SunRPC program NULL
commands in an attempt to determine whether they are RPC
ports, and if so, what program and version number they serve
up.  Thus you can effectively obtain the same info as
&quot;rpcinfo -p&quot; even if the target's portmapper is behind a
firewall (or protected by TCP wrappers).  Decoys do not
currently work with RPC scan, at some point I may add decoy
support for UDP RPC scans.
<DT><B>-sL</B>

<DD>
List scan.  This method simply generates and prints a list of
IP addresses or hostnames without actually pinging or port scanning 
them.  DNS name resolution will be performed unless you use -n.
<DT><B>-b &lt;ftp relay host&gt;</B>

<DD>
FTP bounce attack: An interesting &quot;feature&quot; of the ftp
protocol (RFC 959) is support for &quot;proxy&quot; ftp
connections. In other words, I should be able to connect
from evil.com to the FTP server of target.com and request
that the server send a file ANYWHERE on the Internet!  Now
this may have worked well in 1985 when the RFC was
written. But in today's Internet, we can't have people
hijacking ftp servers and requesting that data be spit out
to arbitrary points on the Internet. As *Hobbit* wrote back
in 1995, this protocol flaw &quot;can be used to post virtually
untraceable mail and news, hammer on servers at various
sites, fill up disks, try to hop firewalls, and generally be
annoying and hard to track down at the same time.&quot; What we
will exploit this for is to (surprise, surprise) scan TCP
ports from a &quot;proxy&quot; ftp server. Thus you could connect to
an ftp server behind a firewall, and then scan ports that
are more likely to be blocked (139 is a good one). If the
ftp server allows reading from and writing to some directory
(such as /incoming), you can send arbitrary data to ports
that you do find open (nmap doesn't do this for you though).

<P>



The argument passed to the &quot;b&quot; option is the host you want
to use as a proxy, in standard URL notation.  The format is:
<I>username:<A HREF="mailto:password@server">password@server</A>:port.  </I>

Everything but 
<I>server</I>

is optional.  To determine what servers are vulnerable to
this attack, you can see my article in
<I>Phrack</I>

51.  An updated version is available at the 
<I>nmap</I>

URL (<A HREF="http://www.insecure.org/nmap).">http://www.insecure.org/nmap).</A>
<DT><B>GENERAL OPTIONS</B>

<DD>
None of these are required but some can be quite useful.  Note that
the -P options can now be combined -- you can increase your odds of
penetrating strict firewalls by sending many probe types using
different TCP ports/flags and ICMP codes.
<DT><B>-P0</B>

<DD>
Do not try to ping hosts at all before scanning them.  This
allows the scanning of networks that don't allow ICMP echo
requests (or responses) through their firewall.
microsoft.com is an example of such a network, and thus you
should always use
<B>-P0</B>

or
<B>-PS80</B>

when portscanning microsoft.com.  Note tht &quot;ping&quot; in this context may
involve more than the traditional ICMP echo request packet.  Nmap
supports many such probes, including arbitrary combinations of TCP,
UDP, and ICMP probes.  By default, Nmap sends an ICMP echo request and
a TCP ACK packet to port 80.
<DT><B>-PA [portlist]</B>

<DD>
Use TCP ACK &quot;ping&quot; to determine what hosts are up.  Instead of sending
ICMP echo request packets and waiting for a response, we spew out TCP
ACK packets throughout the target network (or to a single machine) and
then wait for responses to trickle back.  Hosts that are up should
respond with a RST.  This option preserves the efficiency of only
scanning hosts that are up while still allowing you to scan
networks/hosts that block ping packets.  For non root UNIX users, we
use connect() and thus a SYN is actually being sent.  To set the
destination ports of the probe packets use -PA&lt;port1&gt;[,port2][...].
The default port is 80, since this port is often not filtered out.
Note that this option now accepts multiple, comma-separated port
numbers.
<DT><B>-PS [portlist]</B>

<DD>
This option uses SYN (connection request) packets instead of
ACK packets for root users.  Hosts that are up should
respond with a RST (or, rarely, a SYN|ACK).  You can set the
destination ports in the same manner as -PA above.
<DT><B>-PU [portlist]</B>

<DD>
This option sends UDP probes to the specified hosts, expecting an ICMP
port unreachable packet (or possibly a UDP response if the port is
open) if the host is up.  Since many UDP services won't reply to an
empty packet, your best bet might be to send this to expected-closed
ports rather than open ones.
<DT><B>-PE</B>

<DD>
This option uses a true ping (ICMP echo request) packet.  It
finds hosts that are up and also looks for subnet-directed
broadcast addresses on your network.  These are IP addresses
which are externally reachable and translate to a broadcast
of incoming IP packets to a subnet of computers.  These
should be eliminated if found as they allow for numerous
denial of service attacks (Smurf is the most common).
<DT><B>-PP</B>

<DD>
Uses an ICMP timestamp request (type 13) packet to find listening hosts.
<DT><B>-PM</B>

<DD>
Same as 
<B>-PE</B>

and 
<B>-PP</B>

except uses a netmask request (ICMP type 17).
<DT><B>-PB</B>

<DD>
This is the default ping type.  It uses both the ACK (
<B>-PA</B>

) and ICMP echo request (
<B>-PE</B>

) sweeps in parallel.  This way you can get firewalls that filter
either one (but not both).  The TCP probe destination port can be set
in the same manner as with -PA above.  Note that this flag is now deprecated
as pingtype flags can now be used in combination.  So you should use both &quot;PE&quot;
and &quot;PA&quot; (or rely on the default behavior) to achieve this same effect.
<DT><B>-O</B>

<DD>
This option activates remote host identification via TCP/IP
fingerprinting.  In other words, it uses a bunch of
techniques to detect subtleties in the underlying operating
system network stack of the computers you are scanning.  It
uses this information to create a &quot;fingerprint&quot; which it
compares with its database of known OS fingerprints (the
nmap-os-fingerprints file) to decide what type of system you
are scanning.

<P>



If Nmap is unable to guess the OS of a machine, and conditions are
good (e.g. at least one open port), Nmap will provide a URL you can use
to submit the fingerprint if you know (for sure) the OS running on the
machine.  By doing this you contribute to the pool of operating
systems known to nmap and thus it will be more accurate for everyone.
Note that if you leave an IP address on the form, the machine may be
scanned when we add the fingerprint (to validate that it works).

<P>



The -O option also enables several other tests.  One is the &quot;Uptime&quot;
measurement, which uses the TCP timestamp option (RFC 1323) to guess
when a machine was last rebooted.  This is only reported for machines
which provide this information.

<P>



Another test enabled by -O is TCP Sequence Predictability
Classification.  This is a measure that describes approximately how
hard it is to establish a forged TCP connection against the remote
host.  This is useful for exploiting source-IP based trust
relationships (rlogin, firewall filters, etc) or for hiding the source
of an attack.  The actual difficulty number is based on statistical
sampling and may fluctuate.  It is generally better to use the English
classification such as &quot;worthy challenge&quot; or &quot;trivial joke&quot;.  This is
only reported in normal output with -v.

<P>



When verbose mode (-v) is on with -O, IPID Sequence Generation is also reported.  Most machines are in the &quot;incremental&quot; class, which means that they increment the &quot;ID&quot; field in the IP header for each packet they send.  This makes them vulnerable to several advanced information gathering and spoofing attacks.
<DT><B>--osscan_limit</B>

<DD>
OS detection is far more effective if at least one open and one closed
TCP port are found.  Set this option and Nmap will not even try OS
detection against hosts that do not meet this criteria.  This can save
substantial time, particularly on -P0 scans against many hosts.  It
only matters when OS detection is requested (-O or -A options).
<DT><B>-A</B>

<DD>
This option enables _a_dditional _a_dvanced and _a_ggressive options.
I haven't decided exactly which it stands for yet :).  Presently
this enables OS Detection (-O) and version scanning (-sV).  More
features may be added in the future.  The point is to enable a
comprehensive set of scan options without people having to remember a
large set of flags.  This option only enables features, and not timing
options (such as -T4) or verbosity options (-v) that you might wan't
as well.
<DT><B>-6</B>

<DD>
This options enables IPv6 support.  All targets must be IPv6 if this
option is used, and they can be specified via normal DNS name (AAAA
record) or as a literal IP address such as
3ffe:501:4819:2000:210:f3ff:fe03:4d0 .  Currently, connect() TCP scan
and TCP connect() Ping scan are supported.  If you need UDP or other
scan types, have a look at <A HREF="http://nmap6.sourceforge.net/">http://nmap6.sourceforge.net/</A> .
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
This option causes the requested SYN, FIN, XMAS, or NULL
scan to use tiny fragmented IP packets.  The idea is to
split up the TCP header over several packets to make it
harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and
other annoyances to detect what you are doing. Be careful
with this! Some programs have trouble handling these tiny
packets. My favorite sniffer segmentation faulted
immediately upon receiving the first 36-byte fragment. After
that comes a 24 byte one! While this method won't get by
packet filters and firewalls that queue all IP fragments
(like the CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG option in the Linux
kernel), some networks can't afford the performance hit this
causes and thus leave it disabled.

<P>



Note that I do not yet have this option working on all
systems.  It works fine for my Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD
boxes and some people have reported success with other *NIX
variants.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Verbose mode.  This is a highly recommended option and it
gives out more information about what is going on.  You can
use it twice for greater effect.  You can also use 
<B>-d</B>

a few times if you really want to get crazy with
scrolling the screen!
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
This handy option display a quick reference screen of nmap
usage options.  As you may have noticed, this man page is
not exactly a &quot;quick reference&quot; :)
<DT><B>-oN &lt;logfilename&gt;</B>

<DD>
This logs the results of your scans in a normal
<B>human readable </B>

form into the file you specify as an argument.
<DT><B>-oX &lt;logfilename&gt;</B>

<DD>
This logs the results of your scans in
<B>XML</B>

form into the file you specify as an argument.  This allows programs
to easily capture and interpret Nmap results.  You can give the
argument &quot;-&quot; (without quotes) to shoot output into stdout (for shell
pipelines, etc).  In this case normal output will be suppressed.
Watch out for error messages if you use this (they will still go to
stderr).  Also note that &quot;-v&quot; may cause some extra information to be
printed.  The Document Type Definition (DTD) defining the XML output
structure is available at <A HREF="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/data/nmap.dtd">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/data/nmap.dtd</A> .
<DT><B>-oG &lt;logfilename&gt;</B>

<DD>
This logs the results of your scans in a

form into the file you specify as an argument.  This simple format
provides all the information on one line (so you can easily grep for
port or OS information and see all the IPs.  This used to be the
preferred mechanism for programs to interact with Nmap, but now we
recommend XML output (-oX instead).  This simple format may not
contain as much information as the other formats.  You can give the
argument &quot;-&quot; (without quotes) to shoot output into stdout (for shell

<DD>
This tells Nmap to log in ALL the major formats (normal, grepable,
and XML).  You give a base for the filename, and the output files will
be base.nmap, base.gnmap, and base.xml.
<DT><B>-oS &lt;logfilename&gt;</B>

<DT><B>--resume &lt;logfilename&gt;</B>

<DD>
A network scan that is canceled due to control-C, network
outage, etc. can be resumed using this option.  The
logfilename must be either a normal (-oN) or grepable (-oG) 
log from the aborted scan.  No other options
can be given (they will be the same as the aborted scan).
Nmap will start on the machine after the last one
successfully scanned in the log file.
<DT><B>--exclude &lt;host1 [,host2][,host3],...&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies a list of targets (hosts, ranges, netblocks) that should be 
excluded from a scan. Useful to keep from scanning yourself, your ISP, 
particularly sensitive hosts, etc.
<DT><B>--excludefile &lt;exclude_file&gt;</B>

<DD>
Same functionality as the --exclude option, only the excluded targets
are provided in an newline-delimited exclude_file rather than on the
command line.
<DT><B>--append_output</B>

<DD>
Tells Nmap to append scan results to any output files you have specified
rather than overwriting those files.
<DT><B>-iL &lt;inputfilename&gt;</B>

<DD>
Reads target specifications from the file specified RATHER
than from the command line.  The file should contain a list
of host or network expressions separated by spaces, tabs, or
newlines.  Use a hyphen (-) as
<I>inputfilename </I>

if you want nmap to read host expressions from
stdin (like at the end of a pipe).  See the section
<I>target specification</I>

for more information on the expressions you fill the file with.
<DT><B>-iR &lt;num hosts&gt;</B>

<DD>
This option tells Nmap to generate its own hosts to scan by
simply picking random numbers :).  It will never end after the given
number of IPs has been scanned -- use 0 for a never-ending scan.  This
option can be useful for statistical sampling of the Internet to
estimate various things.  If you are ever really bored, try
<I>nmap -sS -PS80 -iR 0 -p 80</I>

to find some web servers to look at.
<DT><B>-p &lt;port ranges&gt;</B>

<DD>
This option specifies what ports you want to specify. For
example &quot;-p 23&quot; will only try port 23 of the target host(s).
&quot;-p 20-30,139,60000-&quot; scans ports between 20 and 30, port
139, and all ports greater than 60000.  The default is to
scan all ports between 1 and 1024 as well as any ports
listed in the services file which comes with nmap.  For IP protocol
scanning (-sO), this specifies the protocol number you wish to scan
for (0-255).

<P>



When scanning both TCP and UDP ports, you can specify a particular
protocol by preceding the port numbers by &quot;T:&quot; or &quot;U:&quot;.  The qualifier
lasts until you specify another qualifier.  For example, the argument
&quot;-p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080&quot; would scan UDP ports 53,111,and
137, as well as the listed TCP ports.  Note that to scan both UDP &amp;
TCP, you have to specify -sU and at least one TCP scan type (such as
-sS, -sF, or -sT).  If no protocol qualifier is given, the port
numbers are added to all protocol lists.
<DT><B>-F Fast scan mode.</B>

<DD>
Specifies that you only wish to scan for ports listed in the services
file which comes with nmap (or the protocols file for -sO).  This is
obviously much faster than scanning all 65535 ports on a host.
<DT><B>-D &lt;decoy1 [,decoy2][,ME],...&gt;</B>

<DD>
Causes a decoy scan to be performed which makes it appear to
the remote host that the host(s) you specify as decoys are
scanning the target network too.  Thus their IDS might
report 5-10 port scans from unique IP addresses, but they
won't know which IP was scanning them and which were
innocent decoys.  While this can be defeated through router
path tracing, response-dropping, and other &quot;active&quot;
mechanisms, it is generally an extremely effective technique
for hiding your IP address.

<P>



Separate each decoy host with commas, and you can optionally
use &quot;ME&quot; as one of the decoys to represent the position you
want your IP address to be used.  If you put &quot;ME&quot; in the
6th position or later, some common port scan detectors (such
as Solar Designer's excellent scanlogd) are unlikely to
show your IP address at all.  If you don't use &quot;ME&quot;, nmap
will put you in a random position.

<P>



Note that the hosts you use as decoys should be up or you
might accidentally SYN flood your targets.  Also it will be
pretty easy to determine which host is scanning if only one
is actually up on the network.  You might want to use IP
addresses instead of names (so the decoy networks don't see
you in their nameserver logs).

<P>



Also note that some &quot;port scan detectors&quot; will
firewall/deny routing to hosts that attempt port scans.  The problem
is that many scan types can be forged (as this option demonstrates).
So attackers can cause such a machine to sever connectivity with
important hosts such as its internet gateway, DNS TLD servers, sites
like Windows Update, etc.  Most such software offers whitelist
capabilities, but you are unlikely to enumerate all of the critical
machines.  For this reason we never recommend taking
action against port scans that can be forged, including SYN scans, UDP
scans, etc.  The machine you block could just be a decoy.

<P>



Decoys are used both in the initial ping scan (using ICMP,
SYN, ACK, or whatever) and during the actual port scanning
phase.  Decoys are also used during remote OS detection (
<B>-O</B>

).

<P>



It is worth noting that using too many decoys may slow your
scan and potentially even make it less accurate.  Also, some
ISPs will filter out your spoofed packets, although many
(currently most) do not restrict spoofed IP packets at all.
<DT><B>-S &lt;IP_Address&gt;</B>

<DD>
In some circumstances, 
<I>nmap</I>

may not be able to determine your source address (
<I>nmap </I>

will tell you if this is the case).  In this situation, use
-S with your IP address (of the interface you wish to send
packets through).

<P>



Another possible use of this flag is to spoof the scan to
make the targets think that
<B>someone else</B>

is scanning them.  Imagine a company being repeatedly port
scanned by a competitor!  This is not a supported usage (or
the main purpose) of this flag.  I just think it raises an
interesting possibility that people should be aware of
before they go accusing others of port scanning them.
<B>-e</B>

would generally be required for this sort of usage.
<DT><B>-e &lt;interface&gt;</B>

<DD>
Tells nmap what interface to send and receive packets on.
Nmap should be able to detect this but it will tell you if
it cannot.
<DT><B>--source_port &lt;portnumber&gt;</B>

<DD>
Sets the source port number used in scans.  Many naive firewall and
packet filter installations make an exception in their ruleset to
allow DNS (53) or FTP-DATA (20) packets to come through and establish
a connection.  Obviously this completely subverts the security
advantages of the firewall since intruders can just masquerade as FTP
or DNS by modifying their source port.  Obviously for a UDP scan you
should try 53 first and TCP scans should try 20 before 53.  Note that
this is only a request -- nmap will honor it only if and when it is
able to.  For example, you can't do TCP ISN sampling all from one
host:port to one host:port, so nmap changes the source port even if
you used this option.  This is an alias for the shorter, but harder to
remember, -g option.

<P>



Be aware that there is a small performance penalty on some
scans for using this option, because I sometimes store
useful information in the source port number.
<DT><B>--data_length &lt;number&gt;</B>

<DD>
Normally Nmap sends minimalistic packets that only contain a header.
So its TCP packets are generally 40 bytes and ICMP echo requests are
just 28.  This option tells Nmap to append the given number of
random bytes to most of the packets it sends.  OS detection (-O)
packets are not affected, but most pinging and portscan packets are.
This slows things down, but can be slightly less conspicuous.
<DT><B>-n</B>

<DD>
Tells Nmap to
<B>NEVER</B>

do reverse DNS resolution on the active IP addresses it finds.  Since DNS is often slow, this can help speed things up.
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Tells Nmap to
<B>ALWAYS</B>

do reverse DNS resolution on the target IP addresses.  Normally
this is only done when a machine is found to be alive.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Tells Nmap 
<B>NOT</B>

to randomize the order in which ports are scanned.
<DT><B>--ttl &lt;value&gt;</B>

<DD>
Sets the IPv4 time to live field in sent packets to the given value.
<DT><B>--randomize_hosts</B>

<DD>
Tells Nmap to shuffle each group of up to 2048 hosts before
it scans them.  This can make the scans less obvious to
various network monitoring systems, especially when you
combine it with slow timing options (see below).
<DT><B>-M &lt;max sockets&gt;</B>

<DD>
Sets the maximum number of sockets that will be used in
parallel for a TCP connect() scan (the default).  This is
useful to slow down the scan a little bit and avoid crashing
remote machines.  Another approach is to use -sS, which is
generally easier for machines to handle.
<DT><B>--packet_trace</B>

<DD>
Tells Nmap to show all the packets it sends and receives in a
tcpdump-like format.  This can be tremendously useful for debugging,
and is also a good learning tool.
<DT><B>--datadir [directoryname]</B>

<DD>
Nmap obtains some special data at runtime in files named
nmap-services, nmap-protocols, nmap-rpc, and nmap-os-fingerprints.
Nmap first searches these files in the directory option to --nmapdir.
Any files not found there, are searched for in the directory specified
by the NMAPDIR environmental variable.  Next comes ~/nmap, and then
a compiled-in location such as /usr/share/nmap .  As a last resort,
Nmap will look in the current directory.
<DT><B>TIMING OPTIONS</B>

<DD>
Generally Nmap does a good job at adjusting for Network
characteristics at runtime and scanning as fast as possible
while minimizing that chances of hosts/ports going
undetected.  However, there are same cases where Nmap's
default timing policy may not meet your objectives.  The
following options provide a fine level of control over the
scan timing:
<DT><B>-T &lt;Paranoid|Sneaky|Polite|Normal|Aggressive|Insane&gt;</B>

<DD>
These are canned timing policies for conveniently expressing
your priorities to Nmap.
<B>Paranoid </B>

mode scans
<B>very</B>

slowly in the hopes of avoiding detection by IDS systems.
It serializes all scans (no parallel scanning) and generally
waits at least 5 minutes between sending packets.
<B>Sneaky </B>

is similar, except it
only waits 15 seconds between sending packets.  
<B>Polite</B>

is meant to ease load on the network and reduce the chances
of crashing machines.  It serializes the probes and waits
<B>at least </B>

0.4 seconds between them.  Note that this is generally at least an
order of magnitude slower than default scans, so only use it when you
need to.
<B>Normal</B>

is the default Nmap behavior, which tries to run as quickly
as possible without overloading the network or missing
hosts/ports.
<B>Aggressive</B>

This option can make certain scans (especially SYN scans against
heavily filtered hosts) much faster.  It is recommended for impatient
folks with a fast net connection.
<B>Insane </B>

is only suitable for very fast networks or where you don't
mind losing some information.  It times out hosts in 15
minutes and won't wait more than 0.3 seconds for individual probes.
It does allow for very quick network sweeps though :).  

<P>



You can also reference these by number (0-5).  For example, &quot;-T0&quot;
gives you Paranoid mode and &quot;-T5&quot; is Insane mode.
<DT><B>--host_timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies the amount of time Nmap is allowed to spend
scanning a single host before giving up on that IP.  The
default timing mode has no host timeout.
<DT><B>--max_rtt_timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies the maximum amount of time Nmap is allowed to wait
for a probe response before retransmitting or timing out
that particular probe.  The default mode sets this to about
9000.
<DT><B>--min_rtt_timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
When the target hosts start to establish a pattern of
responding very quickly, Nmap will shrink the amount of time
given per probe.  This speeds up the scan, but can lead to
missed packets when a response takes longer than usual.
With this parameter you can guarantee that Nmap will wait at
least the given amount of time before giving up on a probe.
<DT><B>--initial_rtt_timeout &lt;milliseconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies the initial probe timeout.  This is generally only
useful when scanning firewalled hosts with -P0.  Normally
Nmap can obtain good RTT estimates from the ping and the
first few probes.  The default mode uses 6000.
<DT><B>--max_hostgroup &lt;numhosts&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies the maximum number of hosts that Nmap is allowed to scan in
parallel.  Most of the port scan techniques support multi-host
operation, which makes them much quicker.  Spreading the load among
multiple target hosts makes the scans gentler.  The downside is
increast results latency.  You need to wait for all hosts in a group
to finish, rather than having them pop up one by one.  Specify an
argument of one for old-style (one host at a time) Nmap behavior.
Note that the ping scanner handles its own grouping, and ignores this
value.
<DT><B>--min_hostgroup &lt;milliseconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies the minimum host group size (see previous entry).  Large
values (such as 50) are often beneficial for unattended scans, though they do
take up more memory.  Nmap may override this preference when it needs
to, because a group must all use the same network interface, and some
scan types can only handle one host at a time.
<DT><B>--max_parallelism &lt;number&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies the maximum number of scans Nmap is allowed to
perform in parallel.  Setting this to one means Nmap will
never try to scan more than 1 port at a time.  It also
effects other parallel scans such as ping sweep, RPC scan,
etc.
<DT><B>--min_parallelism &lt;number&gt;</B>

<DD>
Tells Nmap to scan at least the given number of ports in parallel.
This can speed up scans against certain firewalled hosts by an order
of magnitude.  But be careful -- results will become unreliable if you
push it too far.
<DT><B>--scan_delay &lt;milliseconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Specifies the 
<B>minimum</B>

amount of time Nmap must wait between probes.  This is
mostly useful to reduce network load or to slow the scan way
down to sneak under IDS thresholds.
<DT><DD>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TARGET SPECIFICATION</H2>

Everything that isn't an option (or option argument) in nmap
is treated as a target host specification.  The simplest
case is listing single hostnames or IP addresses on the
command line.  If you want to scan a subnet of IP addresses,
you can append
<B>/mask</B>

to the hostname
or IP address. 
<B>mask </B>

must be between 0 (scan the whole Internet) and 32 (scan the
single host specified).  Use /24 to scan a class &quot;C&quot; address
and /16 for a class &quot;B&quot;.

<P>



Nmap also has a more powerful notation which lets you
specify an IP address using lists/ranges for each element.
Thus you can scan the whole class &quot;B&quot; network 192.168.*.* by
specifying &quot;192.168.*.*&quot; or &quot;192.168.0-255.0-255&quot; or even
&quot;192.168.1-50,51-255.1,2,3,4,5-255&quot;.  And of course you can
use the mask notation: &quot;192.168.0.0/16&quot;.  These are all
equivalent.  If you use asterisks (&quot;*&quot;), remember that most
shells require you to escape them with back slashes or
protect them with quotes.

<P>



Another interesting thing to do is slice the Internet the
other way.  Instead of scanning all the hosts in a class
&quot;B&quot;, scan &quot;*.*.5.6-7&quot; to scan every IP address that ends in
.5.6 or .5.7 Pick your own numbers.  For more information on
specifying hosts to scan, see the
<I>examples</I>

section.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2>

Here are some examples of using nmap, from simple and normal
to a little more complex/esoteric.  Note that actual numbers
and some actual domain names are used to make things more
concrete.  In their place you should substitute
addresses/names from
<B>your own network.</B>

I do not think portscanning other networks is illegal; nor
should portscans be construed by others as an attack.  I
have scanned hundreds of thousands of machines and have
received only one complaint.  But I am not a lawyer and some
(anal) people may be annoyed by
<I>nmap </I>

probes.  Get permission first or use at your own risk.

<P>



<B>nmap -v target.example.com</B>


<P>



This option scans all reserved TCP ports on the machine
target.example.com .  The -v means turn on verbose mode.

<P>



<B>nmap -sS -O target.example.com/24</B>


<P>



Launches a stealth SYN scan against each machine that is up
out of the 255 machines on class &quot;C&quot; where
target.example.com resides.  It also tries to determine what
operating system is running on each host that is up and
running.  This requires root privileges because of the SYN
scan and the OS detection.

<P>



<B>nmap -sX -p 22,53,110,143,4564 198.116.*.1-127</B>


<P>



Sends an Xmas tree scan to the first half of each of the 255
possible 8 bit subnets in the 198.116 class &quot;B&quot; address
space.  We are testing whether the systems run sshd, DNS,
pop3d, imapd, or port 4564.  Note that Xmas scan doesn't
work on Microsoft boxes due to their deficient TCP stack.
Same goes with CISCO, IRIX, HP/UX, and BSDI boxes.

<P>



<B>nmap -v --randomize_hosts -p 80 *.*.2.3-5</B>


<P>



Rather than focus on a specific IP range, it is sometimes
interesting to slice up the entire Internet and scan a small
sample from each slice.  This command finds all web servers
on machines with IP addresses ending in .2.3, .2.4, or .2.5.  
If you are root you might as well add -sS.  Also you will
find more interesting machines starting at 127. so you might
want to use &quot;127-222&quot; instead of the first asterisks because
that section has a greater density of interesting machines
(IMHO).

<P>



<B>host -l company.com | cut -d  -f 4 | ./nmap -v -iL -</B>


<P>



Do a DNS zone transfer to find the hosts in company.com and
then feed the IP addresses to
<I>nmap.</I>

The above commands are for my GNU/Linux box.  You may need
different commands/options on other operating systems.

Note that the GPL places important restrictions on &quot;derived works&quot;, yet
it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid
misunderstandings, we consider an application to constitute a
&quot;derivative work&quot; for the purpose of this license if it does any of the
following:

<P>



o Integrates source code from Nmap

<P>



o Reads or includes Nmap copyrighted data files, such as

clarify our interpretation of derived works with some common examples.
These restrictions only apply when you actually redistribute Nmap.  For
example, nothing stops you from writing and selling a proprietary

<A HREF="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/</A> to download Nmap.

<P>



We don't consider these to be added restrictions on top of the GPL, but
just a clarification of how we interpret &quot;derived works&quot; as it applies
to our GPL-licensed Nmap product.  This is similar to the way Linus
