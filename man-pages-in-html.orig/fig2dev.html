<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Fig2dev</I>

translates fig code in the named
<I>fig-file</I>

into the specified graphics
<I>language</I>

and puts them in
<I>out-file.</I>

The default
<I>fig-file</I>

and
<I>out-file</I>

are standard input and standard output, respectively
<P>

Xfig (Facility for Interactive Generation of figures) is a screen-oriented
tool which runs under the X Window System, and
allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively.
This version of fig2dev is compatible with
xfig versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2.
<P>

Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to edit comments
for each Fig object.  These comments are output with several of the output languages,
such as PostScript, CGM, EMF, LaTeX, MetaFont, PicTeX, (as % comments),
tk (as # comments), and pic (as .\&quot; comments).
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GENERAL OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-L language</B>

<DD>
Set the output graphics language.
Valid languages are
<B>box, cgm, epic, eepic, eepicemu, emf, eps, gif, ibmgl, jpeg,
latex, map (HTML image map), mf (MetaFont),
mp (MetaPost), mmp (Multi-MetaPost),
pcx, pdf, pdftex, pdftex_t, pic, pictex, png, ppm, ps,
pstex, pstex_t, ptk (Perl/tk),
sld (AutoCad slide format), textyl,
tiff, tk (tcl/tk), tpic, xbm and
xpm</B>.
<P>
Notes:
<BR>

<I>dvips</I>

and
<I>xdvi</I>

must be compiled with the tpic support (-DTPIC) for epic, eepic and tpic to work.
<BR>

You must have ghostscript and ps2pdf, which comes with the ghostscript distribution
to get the pdf output and the bitmap formats (png, jpeg, etc.), and the netpbm (pbmplus)
package to get gif, xbm, xpm, and sld output.
<P>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Print help message with all options for all output languages then exit.
<P>
<DT><B>-D +/-rangelist</B>

<DD>
With +rangelist, keep only those depths in the list.  With -rangelist, keep all
depths except those in the list. The rangelist may be a list of comma-separated
numbers or ranges separated by colon (:). For example, -D +10,40,55:70,80
means keep only layers 10, 40, 55 <B>through</B> 70, and 80.
<P>
<DT><B>-f font</B>

<DD>
Set the default font used for text objects to
<I>font.</I>

The default is Roman; the format of this option depends on the graphics
<I>language</I>

in use.
In TeX-based languages, the font is the base of the name given in lfonts.tex,
for instance &quot;cmr&quot; for Roman, or &quot;tt&quot; for teletype.
In PostScript, it is any font name known to the printer or interpreter.
<P>
<DT><B>-G minor[:major][:unit]</B>

<DD>
Draws a grid on the page.  Specify thin, or thin and thick line
spacing in one of several units.  For example, &quot;-G .25:1cm&quot; draws a thin,
gray line every .25 cm and a thicker gray line every 1 cm.  Specifying
&quot;-G 1in&quot; draws a thin line every 1 inch.
Fractions may be used, e.g. &quot;-G 1/16:1/2in&quot; will draw a thin line every
1/16 inch (0.0625 inch) and a thick line every 1/2 inch.
<BR>

Allowable units are: i, in, inch, f, ft, feet, c, cm, mm, and m.
<BR>

<B>Only allowed for PostScript, EPS, PDF, and bitmap (GIF, JPEG, etc) drivers for now.</B>

<P>
<DT><B>-j</B>

<DD>
Enable the I18N internationalization facility.
<P>
<DT><B>-m mag</B>

<DD>
Set the magnification at which the figure is rendered to
<I>mag.</I>

The default is 1.0.
<P>
<DT><B>-s size</B>

<DD>
Set the default font size (in points) for text objects to
<I>fsize.</I>

The default is 11*mag, and thus is scaled by the <B>-m</B> option.
If there is no scaling, the default font is eleven point Roman.&quot;
<P>
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
Print the program version number and exit.
<P>
<DT><I>other options</I>

<DD>
The other options are specific to the choice of graphics
<I>language,</I>

as described below.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CGM OPTIONS</H2>

CGM is Computer Graphics Metafile, developed by ISO and ANSI and is a
vector-based plus bitmap language.  Microsoft WORD, PowerPoint and probably
other products can import this format
<I>and display it on the screen,</I>

something that they won't do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b dummyarg</B>

<DD>
Generate binary output (dummy argument required after the &quot;-b&quot;).
<P>
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Position arrowheads for CGM viewers that display rounded arrowheads.
Normally, arrowheads are pointed, so fig2dev compensates for this by
moving the endpoint of the line back so the tip of the arrowhead ends
where the original endpoint of the line was.
If the <B>-r</B> option is used, the position
of arrows will <I>NOT</I> be corrected for compensating line width effects,
because the rounded arrowhead doesn't extend beyond the endpoint of the line.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EMF OPTIONS</H2>

EMF is Enhanced Metafile, developed by Microsoft and is a
vector-based plus bitmap language.  Microsoft WORD, PowerPoint and probably
other products can import this format
<I>and display it on the screen,</I>

something that they won't do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EPIC OPTIONS</H2>

EPIC is an enhancement to LaTeX picture drawing environment.
It was developed by Sunil Podar of Department of Computer Science
in S.U.N.Y at Stony Brook.
<P>

EEPIC is an extension to EPIC and LaTeX picture drawing environment
which uses tpic specials as a graphics mechanism.
It was written by Conrad Kwok of Division of
Computer Science at University of California, Davis.
<P>

EEPIC-EMU is an EEPIC emulation package which does not use tpic specials.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-A factor</B>

<DD>
Scale arrowheads by
<I>factor.</I>

The width and height of arrowheads is
<I>divided</I>

by this factor.  This is because
<I>EPIC</I>

arrowheads are normally about
double the size of
<I>TeX</I>

arrowheads.
<P>
<DT><B>-E num</B>

<DD>
Set encoding for text translation (0 = none, 1 = ISO-8859-1, 2 = ISO-8859-2)
<P>
<DT><B>-F</B>

<DD>
Don't set the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the
baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it 
puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't set the font from your
LaTeX document. With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX
document (like &quot;<B>\sfshape \input picture.eepic</B>&quot;).
<DT><DD>
If any of the pictures included in your LaTeX document has been generated
with <B>-F</B>, then all pictures must be generated with this option.
<DT><DD>
This option can be used only when fig2dev was compiled with NFSS defined.
<P>
<DT><B>-l width</B>

<DD>
Use &quot;<B>\thicklines</B>&quot; when width of the line is wider than
<I>lwidth.</I>

The default is 2.
<P>
<DT><B>-P</B>

<DD>
Generate a complete LaTeX file. In other words, the output file can be
formatted without requiring any changes. The additional text inserted
in the beginning and at the end of the file is controlled by the
configuration parameter &quot;Preamble&quot; and &quot;Postamble&quot;.
<P>
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Allow rotated text. Rotated text will be set using the \rotatebox command.
So, you will need to include &quot;<B>\usepackage{graphics}</B>&quot; in the preamble
of your LaTeX document.
<DT><DD>
If this option is not set, then rotated text will be set horizontally.
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-S scale</B>

<DD>
Set the scale to which the figure is rendered.
This option automatically sets the
<I>magnification</I>

and size to
<I>scale</I>

/ 12 and
<I>scale</I>

respectively.
<P>
<DT><B>-t stretch</B>

<DD>
Set the stretch factor of dashed lines to
<I>sretch.</I>

The default is 30.
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Include comments in the output file.
<P>
<DT><B>-W</B>

<DD>
Enable variable line width.  By default, only two line widths are
available: The normal line width (	hinlines), and thick
lines (	hicklines), if a line width of more than one is selected in xfig.
<P>
<DT><B>-w</B>

<DD>
Disable variable line width. Only &quot;<B>\thicklines</B>&quot; and/or
&quot;<B>\thinlines</B>&quot; commands will be generated in the output file.
<DT><DD>
When variable line width option is enabled, &quot;<B>\thinlines</B>&quot;
command is still used when line width is less than
<I>LineThick</I>. One potential problem is that the width of
&quot;<B>\thinlines</B>&quot; is 0.4pt
but the resolution of Fig is 1/80 inch (approx. 1pt). If
<I>LineThick</I> is set to 2, normal lines will be drawn in 0.4pt
wide lines but the next line width is already 2pt. One possible
solution is to set <I>LineThick</I> to 1 and set the width of the
those lines you want to be drawn in &quot;<B>\thinlines</B>&quot;  to 0.
<P>
Due to this problem, Variable line width <I>VarWidth</I>
is defaulted to be false.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>IBM-GL (HP/GL) OPTIONS</H2>

IBM-GL (IBM Graphics Language) is compatible
with HP-GL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-a</B>

<DD>
Select ISO A4 (ANSI A) paper size if the default is ANSI A (ISO A4) paper size.
<P>
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Generate instructions for an IBM 6180 Color Plotter
with (without) an IBM Graphics Enhancement Cartridge (IBM-GEC).
<P>
<DT><B>-d xll,yll,xur,yur</B>

<DD>
Restrict plotting to a rectangular area of the plotter paper which has
a lower left hand corner at
<I>(xll,yll)</I>

and a upper right hand corner at
<I>(xur,yur).</I>

All four numbers are in inches and follow <B>-d</B> in a comma-sparated list -
<I>xll,yll,xur,yur</I>

- with no spaces between them.
<P>
<DT><B>-f file</B>

<DD>
Load text character specifications from the table in the
<I>fonts</I>

file.
The table must have 36 entries - one for each font plus a default.
Each entry consists of 5 numbers
which specify the
1.) standard character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39),
2.) alternate character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39),
3.) character slant angle (degrees),
4.) character width scale factor and
5.) character height scale factor.
<P>
<DT><B>-k</B>

<DD>
Precede output with PCL command to use HP/GL
<P>
<DT><B>-l pattfile</B>

<DD>
Load area fill line patterns from the table in the
<I>pattfile</I>

file.
The table must have 21 entries - one for each of the area fill patterns.
Each entry consists of 5 numbers which specify the
1.) pattern number (-1 - 6),
2.) pattern length (inches),
3.) fill type (1 - 5),
4.) fill spacing (inches) and
5.) fill angle (degrees).
<P>
<DT><B>-m mag,x0,y0</B>

<DD>
The magnification may appear as the first element in a comma separated list -
<I>mag,x0,y0</I>

- where the second and third parameters specify an offset in inches.
<P>
<DT><B>-P</B>

<DD>
Rotate the figure to portrait mode. The default is landscape mode.
<P>
<DT><B>-p penfile</B>

<DD>
Load plotter pen specifications from the table in the
<I>penfile</I>

file.
The table must have 9 entries - one for each color plus a default.
Each entry consists of 2 numbers which specify the
1.) pen number (1 - 8) and
2.) pen thickness (millimeters).
<P>
<DT><B>-S speed</B>

<DD>
Set the pen speed to
<I>speed</I>

(centimeters/second).
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Plot the figure upside-down in portrait mode or backwards in landscape mode.
This allows you to write on the top surface of overhead transparencies without
disturbing the plotter ink on the bottom surface.
</DL>
<P>

Fig2dev may be installed with either ANSI A or ISO A4 default paper size.
The <B>-a</B> option selects the alternate paper size.
Fig2dev does not fill closed splines.
The IBM-GEC is required to fill other polygons.
Fig2dev may be installed for plotters with or without the IBM-GEC.
The <B>-c</B> option selects the alternate instruction set.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS COMMON TO ALL BITMAP FORMATS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b borderwidth</B>

<DD>
Make blank border around figure of width
<I>borderwidth.</I>

<P>
<DT><B>-F</B>

<DD>
Use correct font sizes (points) instead of the traditional size that xfig/fig2dev uses,
which is 1/80 inch.  The corresponding xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size.
<P>
<DT><B>-g color</B>

<DD>
Use
<I>color</I>

for the background.
<P>
<DT><B>-N</B>

<DD>
Convert all colors to grayscale.
<P>
<DT><B>-S smoothfactor</B>

<DD>
This will smooth the output by passing
<I>smoothfactor</I>

to ghostscript in the 
<I>-dTextAlphaBits </I>

and
<I>-dGraphicsAlphaBits</I>

options to improve font rendering and graphic smoothing.
A value of 2 for
<I>smoothfactor</I>

provides some smoothing and 4 provides more.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GIF OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-t color</B>

<DD>
Use
<I>color</I>

for the transparent color in the GIF file.  This must be specified
in the same format that <A HREF="../man1/ppmmake.1.php">ppmmake</A>(1) allows.
It may allow an X11 color name, but at least you may use
a six-digit hexadecimal RGBvalue using the # sign, e.g. #ff0000 (Red).
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>JPEG OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-q image_quality</B>

<DD>
use the integer value
<I>image_quality</I>

for the JPEG &quot;Quality&quot; factor.  Valid values are 0-100, with the default being 75.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>LATEX OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-d dmag</B>

<DD>
Set a separate magnification for the length of line dashes to
<I>dmag.</I>

<P>
<DT><B>-E num</B>

<DD>
Set encoding for latex text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2)
<P>
<DT><B>-l lwidth</B>

<DD>
Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and thick lines to
<I>lwidth</I>

pixels.
LaTeX supports only two different line width: \thinlines and \thicklines.
Lines of width greater than
<I>lwidth</I>

pixels are drawn as \thicklines.
Also affects the size of dots in dotted line style.
The default is 1.
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Verbose mode.
</DL>
<P>

LaTeX cannot accurately represent all the graphics objects which can
be described by Fig.
For example, the possible slopes which lines may have are limited.
Some objects, such as spline curves, cannot be drawn at all.
Fig2latex chooses the closest possible line slope, and prints error
messages when objects cannot be drawn accurately
<P>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MAP (HTML image map) OPTIONS</H2>

Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to edit comments
for each Fig object.
The fig2dev map output language will produce an HTML image map using Fig objects
that have href=&quot;some_html_reference&quot; in their comments.
Any Fig object except compound objects may used for this.
Usually, besides generating the map file, you would also
generate a GIF file, which is the image to which the map refers.
<P>
For example, you may have an xfig drawing with an
imported image that has the comment
href=&quot;go_here.html&quot; and a box object with a comment href=&quot;go_away.html&quot;.
This will produce an image map file such the user
may click on the image and the browser will load the &quot;go_here.html&quot; page,
or click on the box and the browser will load the &quot;go_away.html&quot; page.
<P>
After the map file is generated by
<I>fig2dev</I>

you will need to edit it to fill out any additional information it may need.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-b borderwidth</B>

<DD>
Make blank border around figure of width
<I>borderwidth.</I>

<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>METAFONT OPTIONS</H2>

<I>fig2dev</I>

scales the figure by 1/8 before generating METAFONT code.
The magnification can be further changed with the
<B>-m</B>

option or by giving magnification options to
<B>mf.</B>

<P>

In order to process the generated METAFONT code, the mfpic macros
must be installed where
<B>mf</B>

can find them. The mfpic macro package is available at any CTAN cite
under the subdirectory: graphics/mfpic
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-C code</B>

<DD>
specifies the starting METAFONT font code. The default is 32.
<DT><B>-n name</B>

<DD>
specifies the name to use in the output file.
<DT><B>-p pen_magnification</B>

<DD>
specifies how much the line width should be magnified compared to the
original figure. The default is 1.
<DT><B>-t top</B>

<DD>
specifies the top of the whole coordinate system. The default is
<B>ypos.</B>

<DT><B>-x xmin</B>

<DD>
specifies the minimum x coordinate value of the figure (inches). The
default is 0.
<DT><B>-y ymin</B>

<DD>
specifies the minumum y coordinate value of the figure (inches). The
default is 0.
<DT><B>-X xmax</B>

<DD>
specifies the maximum x coordinate value of the figure (inches). The
default is 8.
<DT><B>-Y ymax</B>

<DD>
specifies the maximum y coordinate value of the figure (inches). The
default is 8.

<H2>PIC OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-p ext</B>

<DD>
Enables the use of certain PIC extensions which are known to work with
the groff package; compatibility with DWB PIC is unknown.
The extensions enabled by each option are:
</DL>
<P>

<PRE>

<B>arc</B>     Allow ARC_BOX i.e. use rounded corners
<BR>
<B>line</B>    Use the 'line_thickness' value
<BR>
<B>fill</B>    Allow ellipses to be filled
<BR>
<B>all</B>     Use all of the above
<BR>
<B>psfont</B>  Don't convert Postscript fonts generic type
        (useful for files going to be Ditroff'ed for
        and printed on PS printer). DWB-compatible.
<BR>
<B>allps</B>   Use all of the above (i.e. &quot;all&quot; + &quot;psfont&quot;)
</PRE>


<P>
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PICTEX OPTIONS</H2>

In order to include PiCTeX pictures into a document, it is necessary to
load the PiCTeX macros.
<P>

PiCTeX uses TeX integer register arithmetic to generate curves,
and so it is very slow.
PiCTeX draws curves by <B>\put</B>-ing the <I>psymbol</I> repeatedly,
and so requires a large amount of TeX's internal memory,
and generates large DVI files.
The size of TeX's memory limits the number of plot symbols in a picture.
As a result, it is best to use PiCTeX to generate small pictures.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-E num</B>

<DD>
Set encoding for latex text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2)
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>POSTSCRIPT, ENCAPSULATED POSTSCRIPT (EPS), and PDF OPTIONS</H2>

With PostScript, xfig can be used to create multiple page figures 
Specify the -M option to produce a multi-page output. 
For posters, add -O to overlap the pages slightly to get around the problem of
the unprintable area in most printers, then cut and paste the pages together.
Due to memory limitations of most laser printers, the figure should not
have large imported images (bitmaps). Great for text with very big letters.
<P>

The EPS driver has the following differences from PostScript:
<BR>


o No showpage is generated because the output is meant to be imported
into another program or document and not printed
<BR>

o The landscape/portrait options are ignored
<BR>

o The centering option is ignored
<BR>

o The multiple-page option is ignored
<BR>

o The paper size option is ignored
<BR>

o The x/y offset options are ignored
<P>

The EPS driver has the following two special options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-B 'Wx [Wy X0 Y0]'</B>

<DD>
This specifies that the bounding box of the EPS file should have the
width Wx and the height Wy. 
If a value less than or equal to 0 is specified for Wx or Wy, these are set 
to the width/height respectively of the figure. Origin is relative to
screen (0,0) (upper-left).
Wx, Wy, X0 and Y0 are interpreted in centimeters or inches depending on the measure 
given in the fig-file.
Remember to put either quotes (&quot;) or apostrophes (') to group the arguments to -B.
<DT><B>-R 'Wx [Wy X0 Y0]'</B>

<DD>
Same as the -B option except that X0 and Y0 is relative to the lower 
left corner of the 
<B>figure.</B>

Remember to put either quotes (&quot;) or apostrophes (') to group the arguments to -R.
</DL>
<P>

The PDF driver uses all the PostScript options.
<P>

Text can now include various ISO-character codes above 0x7f, which is
useful for language specific characters to be printed directly.
Not all ISO-characters are implemented.
<P>

Color support: Colored objects created by Fig can be printed
on a color postscript printer. There are 32 standard colors:
black, yellow, white, gold,
five shades of blue, four shades of green,
four shades of cyan, four shades of red, five shades of magenta,
four shades of brown, and four shades of pink.
In addition there may be user-defined colors in the file.  See the
xfig FORMAT3.2 file for the definition of these colors.
On a monochrome printer, colored objects will be mapped into different
grayscales by the printer.
Filled objects are printed using the given area fill and color.
There are 21 &quot;shades&quot; going from black to full saturation of the fill color,
and 21 more &quot;tints&quot; from full saturation + 1 to white.
In addition, there are 16 patterns such as bricks, diagonal lines,
crosshatch, etc.

<H2>PSTEX OPTIONS</H2>

The
<B>pstex</B>

language is a variant of
<B>ps</B>

which suppresses formatted (special) text.
The
<B>pstex_t</B>

language has the complementary behavior: it generates only the LaTeX
special text and the commands
necessary to position special text, and to overlay the
PostScript file generated using
<B>pstex.</B>

These two drivers can be used to generate a figure which combines the
flexibility of PostScript graphics with LaTeX text formatting of
special text.

<DD>
Don't set the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the
baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it 
puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't set the font from your
LaTeX document. With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX
document (like &quot;<B>\sfshape \input picture.eepic</B>&quot;).

(Brian V. Smith)
<P>

Arc-boxes are not supported for the tk output language, and only X bitmap pictures
are supported because of the canvas limitation in tk.
<P>

Picture objects are not scaled with the magnification factor for tk output.
<P>

Because tk scales canvas items according to the X display resolution,
polygons, lines, etc. may be scaled differently than imported pictures (bitmaps)
which aren't scaled at all.
<P>

Rotated text is only supported in the IBM-GL (HP/GL) and PostScript (including eps)
languages.
